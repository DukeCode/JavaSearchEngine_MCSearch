and we seem to be in the middle of the Cold War 2.0. Anyone who has ever watched a ballet also knows how terrifyingly capable dancers are with their steely strength athleticism and discipline. Ms. Lawrence best known as the teenage survivalist turned savior Katniss Everdeen in the ���Hunger Games�� series has played rough before so when her character in ���Red Sparrow�� brutally twists in a knife it��s almost like old home week." �� Jennifer Lawrence plays a Russian ballerina turned murderous spy. And why not?" though she speaks angry truth to power when she accuses her uncle of sending her to ���whore school.�� Filled with pretty young things ��� all equally exploitable women and men ��� this is a suitably grim academy supervised by a severe matron who could be the daughter of Rosa Klebb one of James Bond��s most memorable adversaries. A diminutive operative with a knife in her shoe Klebb (an indelibly ferocious Lotte Lenya) appears in the Cold War-era film ���From Russia With Love.�� Part of what��s both queasily provocative and instructive about ���Red Sparrow�� is that while Dominika might have been a Bond Girl in an earlier time (or really just in the next flick) here she��s allowed to go full-on Klebb." daubing and washing that color onto sets costumes and pouty lips. By the time he stages the first murder the blood has begun to flow liberally as if to underscore the movie��s title. The scene makes for a gruesome tableau especially because of its intimacy (death often comes in close-up here) and because of the blood that splatters across Dominika an augury of the lurid messy violence to come. And come it does ��� in dribbles gushes and an occasional shot to the head. ���Red Sparrow�� is based on the novel (the first in a trilogy) of the same title by Jason Matthews a former C.I.A. officer who presumably knows something about the death-dealing world of spy versus spy." like all great stars can slip into a role as if sliding into another skin unburdened by hesitation or self-doubt. Craft and charm are part of what she brings to this role as well as a serviceable accent but it��s her absolute ease and certainty that carry you through ���Red Sparrow.�� She was born to screen stardom and it��s a blast to see where it��s taking her." too is familiar but has notes and beats that have been refurbished and scrambled enough to hold and at times surprise you. Ms. Lawrence plays Dominika Egorova a prima ballerina for the Bolshoi. Her face framed by bangs and a curtain of waist-skimming hair Dominika rules the stage until a midperformance catastrophe cuts her down. With an ailing mother (Joely Richardson) and no money or options she turns to her uncle amusingly named Vanya (Matthias Schoenaerts sliming up his sex appeal) a power monger in the foreign intelligence service who makes her an unsavory offer. She��s to serve as a honey pot for a man of interest a job that of course goes wrong." as is the rest of a cast that includes Joel Edgerton as Nate a C.I.A. operative in Russia whose cover is blown soon after the movie opens. He��s working with a Russian intelligence insider called Marble a meaty bone that the Americans are gnawing on. (Nate��s colleagues include a roundup of yammering evidently spineless bosses in the States and a few colleagues in the field played by Sakina Jaffrey and Bill Camp with stern faces and wit.) While Nate takes care of American business Dominika is forced deeper into the Russian intelligence apparatus a two-track narrative that finds him fighting for credibility while she trains to become a Motherland prostitute." but it��s both appealing and crucial that ���Red Sparrow�� doesn��t soft sell Dominika. There��s an attractive recognizable toughness to her as well as a febrile intensity born from need and circumstances including the existential reality of being a woman in a man��s world. Dominika is sentimental (mostly about her mother) but she isn��t sentimentalized and never becomes the movie��s virgin or its whore its femme fatale or good girl. She��s just the one carrying the fast-track story. And when Dominika becomes involved with Nate it��s because well that��s how the roles were written. Ms. Lawrence and Mr. Edgerton never manage to spark but it scarcely matters; their characters are too busy to seriously moon over each other." though there are few self-aware winks in ���Red Sparrow.�� Working from Justin Haythe��s script Mr. Lawrence folds in moments of levity (a delectably acid and funny Mary-Louise Parker stirs things up) but ���Red Sparrow�� mostly hews closer in grim vibe and viciousness to Bourne than to Bond. And in classic fashion Dominika endures the extremes of punishment ��� penance that centers on her pulverized near-martyred body ��� that often come with heroic journeys. The rawness of the violence is startling partly because despite ���Atomic Blonde�� and other female-driven movies it��s still unusual to see a woman receive (and freely mete out) such barbarity." which suggests it would also approve of the movie��s politics (United States good Russia bad); humorously the agency did warn that the sex was explicit and ���the Russian characters are not as nuanced as their U.S. counterparts.�� (The violence onscreen is as with most mainstream movies blunter and more attentively staged and filmed than the sex which is ho-hum decorous.) The Russians are about as movie-real as the American characters which mostly just means that they��re types fleshed out with recognizably human detailing and all the polished professionalism ��� and the slight detached irony ��� that comes when you hire smooth veterans like Charlotte Rampling Jeremy Irons and Ciaran Hinds." Ms. Lawrence goes all in seamlessly meeting the movie��s physical demands ��� whether she��s dancing onstage or crawling in blood ��� while turning Dominika into a character who grows more real with each unreal scene. She worked with Mr. Lawrence on three ���Hunger Games�� movies and this shared history probably smoothed some of the story��s edges and may also explain why ���Red Sparrow�� moves so fluidly even as the story nuttily kinks and bounces around locations."

Yet where the original film (based on Brian Garfield��s 1972 anti-vigilantism novel) was a brutal psychological study of a bereaved man using random violence almost as a form of therapy the tone here veers from rah-rah to jokey.

The woman��s weeping may be sad at least given the circumstances office decorum and social norms. But her galumphing howls also sound funny too loud faintly ridiculous performative and self-flattering. Setsuko may be mean but in a movie that is very much concerned with identity and the roles that we assume and reject it��s clear that she isn��t entirely unjustified." borderline cutesy setup that ��� once the parts have been snapped into place ��� relaxes into a pleasurable meandering portrait of someone getting another shot maybe the last one at happiness. Things start clicking when Setsuko��s niece (Shioli Kutsuna) persuades her reluctant aunt to take English-language lessons with an American John played by a sweet sympathetic Josh Hartnett. (The great Koji Yakusho plays another student.) John seems laughably ill-equipped for the job; his dubious pedagogical method includes fake names and hairpieces. But after giving her a curly blond wig and a lingering hug he inadvertently transforms Setsuko into Lucy igniting a revolution of self." who plays Setsuko our irresistibly flawed heroine. You first see Setsuko on a crowded train platform a gray speck in a quiet sea of people many wearing white surgical masks. She��s staring ahead as if lost in thought (or maybe simply lost) when a man brushes past her and jumps in front of the coming train. There��s a pause the expected gasps and a discreet shot of the victim. Then Setsuko goes off to another day of work a day like any other except that now she��s deep in a story about identity self-annihilation and stubborn existence." Ms. Terajima fills up that emptiness with deep then deeper waves of feeling and escalating freewheeling comedy. After some narrative busywork John disappears and Setsuko ��� weighted down with a large suitcase and her comically aggressively angry sister (Kaho Minami) ��� follows him to Southern California. There amid the sunshine and enveloping shadows Setsuko finds and then loses herself while cutting loose and engaging in some savage psychological blood sport. She stumbles and she falls plays at being Lucy and slips back into a radically changed Setsuko in a movie in which the human comedy is by turns tender plaintive heartfelt and joyful." �� an against-the-odds charmer about a woman a tragic wig and an improbable journey. It��s a near-minor miracle that just about everything works in this emphatically modest comedy-drama which draws on squishy types and themes ��� the lonely eccentric the cross-cultural clash the revelatory trip ��� that can quickly sink less nimble features. The writer-director Atsuko Hirayanagi isn��t selling a packaged idea about what it means to be human; she does something trickier and more honest here merely by tracing the ordinary absurdities and agonies of one woman��s life." Ms. Terajima��s subtle performance works like a roadblock to easy sympathy. With her defeated shoulders and practiced deadpan Setsuko seems to be a passive observer someone who has become good at watching other people live. She isn��t at all likable and it isn��t clear at least initially if she��s even worthy of sustained interest. When she hunkers down smoking in her tiny uncomfortably cluttered apartment ��� a killing field of empty cans miscellaneous junk and aspirational fashion goods ��� it looks as if she��s living in the aftermath of a disaster of her own making. A lot of actors can weep on cue but it takes one as good as Ms. Terajima to make emptiness feel haunted." Setsuko doesn��t need a reason or even a frown to look unhappy. She doesn��t stand out in a cluttered office that��s a horror show of smiling obsequiousness and barely hidden contempt; she scarcely rates a genuine hello or a shred of interest. Soon after the story opens she attends a retirement party for an older woman who��s being put out to pasture with an ugly bouquet and a grotesque stuffed animal. When the retiring woman starts bawling Setsuko flashes a smile tightly baring her teeth in what seems like an invitation for us to judge her."

That is good advice though it may prove hard to follow at least if you concentrate on the obvious themes of sex and power. But there is more to this chronicle of campus misbehavior than he said/she said and more humor than indignation in the telling. At its best ��� which is to say when it follows the sharp angles and sly nuances of Ms. Prose��s prose most closely ��� ���Submission�� is less an erotic melodrama than a comedy of literary manners." Mr. Levine directing his second feature after working mainly in television (on ���Masters of Sex�� and ���Nip/Tuck �� among other series) is a lesser artist than Ms. Prose. ���Submission�� feels more like an act of devotion or perhaps of submission than a free-standing adaptation. The satire is cautious and the emotions restrained so that what should be a swirl of lust ambition recrimination and bureaucratic absurdity rises only to genteel nervous laughter and mild discomfort. The actors all do their best ��� Ms. Timlin manages the difficult trick of switching back and forth between innocence and its opposite ��� but a crucial element of intensity is missing.

There are a few on-camera interviews with neighbors and relatives but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from ���To Kill a Mockingbird�� provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck��s brave and decent Atticus Finch and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy." accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann��s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event.

Branch a white shopkeeper shot Bill Spann a black man who was in his store. Branch Mr. Wilkerson��s great-grandfather was charged with first-degree murder but no trial was ever held and the crime faded from memory. Or rather the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer." Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism honesty. He doesn��t suppose that his film will solve anything but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather��s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski) and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist ���Southern secessionist�� group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge." �� James Baldwin wrote that ���to accept one��s past ��� one��s history ��� is not the same thing as drowning in it.�� He knew that the superstitious fear of being swallowed up the dread of giving up a fantasy of innocence is precisely what keeps so many white Americans from confronting the uglier aspects of the nation��s legacy." a documentary filmmaker whose roots are in small-town Alabama attempts just such a reckoning in ���Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?�� The movie a scorching and rigorous essay on memory and accountability is neither a profession of guilt nor a performance of virtue. Though his inquiry is intensely at times painfully personal Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power." about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963 is the source of the film��s title and a part of its wider cultural context. ���Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?�� is a passionately political film aflame with rage in spite of its director��s measured ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive intimate and elusive." but also bracing like a shot of strong liquor that leaves you with a clearer head and sharper senses. The movie is an antidote to the lethal innocence that as Baldwin and others have pointed out allows the crimes of racism to remain unpunished and often unacknowledged."

Those names are fairly obscure today while Marx��s is still attached to an -ism however battered. (Does that count as a spoiler?) He and Engels stage both a theoretical and an organizational coup replacing utopian nostrums about the brotherhood of man with a doctrine of conflict between the proletarian and the bourgeoisie. The rest is history bloody and contentious and not yet finished." Mary Burns (Hannah Steele) is a rebellious Irish factory worker. The two women provide a degree of centrifugal energy pulling the story away from politics toward matters of the heart and hearth. But they also for exactly that reason expose gaps in their husbands�� emerging theory of inequality and exploitation. Jenny and Mary support Karl and Friedrich��s work wholeheartedly but also within the parameters of a division of labor that seems beyond the reach of their politics. They clear the dishes tend the children hand out fliers and hang banners ��� part of the history but also at its margins." but the history of class struggle ��� at least the decisive chapter chronicled in ���The Young Karl Marx�� ��� turns out to be a buddy movie. Marx (August Diehl) a scruffy journalist and his sidekick Friedrich Engels (Stefan Konarske) a renegade rich kid meet in Cologne Germany in 1844 and overcome some initial wariness by bonding over their shared contempt for the Young Hegelians. (Man those guys are lame.) They set out to write a ���Critique of Critical Criticism �� and when it��s published (as ���The Holy Family��) it��s something of a hit. By the time the revolutions of 1848 are ready to happen Marx and Engels are the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the European left rock stars for an age of revolution." �� a scripted biography of the Congolese leader and ���I am Not Your Negro �� a documentary drawn from the work of James Baldwin. (His r�sum� also includes a stint as Haiti��s minister of culture.) While in form and style the new movie is a fairly straightforward biopic it is also fundamentally the portrait of a writer a man of letters grappling with both the mundane and the lofty demands of his vocation." the way his film deals with family matters and gender relations is an aspect of its precision and a measure of its insight. The great virtue of ���The Young Karl Marx�� is its clarity its ability to perceive the way the eddies of personal experience flow within the wider stream of history." antagonizes editors and lives in bohemian penury with his wife Jenny (Vicky Krieps) and their infant daughter. The family is harassed by bill collectors and also by the police bouncing from Cologne to Paris to Brussels as Marx��s political agitation brands him a dangerous subversive." notably with respect to the status of women within the global program of emancipation the two dudes so grandly envision."

Working from David Turpin��s script the director Brian O��Malley drapes the house in cobwebs and pours on the dust (the look is Miss Havisham without the cake) and sets the camera loose while he tries to rustle up the scares. These come intermittently and generally when you expect them whether Rachel is dashing through the darkening forest or taking one of those candlelit soaks in the tub that women in storybook peril indulge in." the monsters come out to play but it��s a measure of this movie��s insistently fright-free storytelling that they��re nowhere as disturbing as Mr. Milner��s Edward. He��s one feral twitch away from Renfield in the 1931 ���Dracula �� as the family��s lawyer (David Bradley a welcome wry presence) discovers during a very unwise visit." an occasion that Rachel seems to fear far more than Edward does.

Finally Lena and four other armed women pass into the shimmer which is where the story gets its weird on." ���Annihilation�� tells an enigmatic tale of love and death and alien invasion. Set in a future that looks pretty much like today it centers on a biologist Lena (Natalie Portman) who shortly after the movie opens reunites with her husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) who she thought was dead.

Working once more with the production designer Mark Digby Mr. Garland again turns interior spaces into emblems of isolation and desolation. (Here rooms often seem emptiest when they��re inhabited partly because of how Mr. Garland visually isolates characters in the frame.)

She and the other women have been tasked with understanding both the shimmer and why earlier expeditions failed so profoundly. With Dr. Ventress riding herd Lena and the others ��� a paramedic (Gina Rodriguez) a physicist (Tessa Thompson) and an anthropologist (Tuva Novotny) ��� survey the terrain take samples and fight off threats including in time one another.

It��s almost heartbreaking to contemplate how amazing she would be in a new comedy that was more than intermittently O.K." for the most part a conventional and conventionally vulgar Contemporary Romantic Comedy With Lessons. Its central couple Max and Annie played by Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are avid board-game-and-trivia enthusiasts who are stuck in the fertility department. They��re having trouble conceiving because Max��s sperm are according to his doctor insecure. That probably has something to do with Max��s inferiority complex about his older brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler) an ostensible hotshot who decides one evening to take Max and Annie��s weekly couples game night up a notch by staging a kidnapping mystery." or seems to be. The gun Brooks leaves behind is very much real and loaded as Max learns when one of its rounds goes through his arm.

The experimental playwright Richard Foreman is blunt: ���As far as I��m concerned he created SoHo �� he says." often dividing the screen into multiple panels and making inventive use of sound design. There is no shortage of vintage Fluxus footage or arcana to draw on; the interviews old and new with Maciunas associates like Yoko Ono Nam June Paik and Henry Flynt are informative and often fascinatingly contradictory." �� Jeffrey Perkins an artist who is described in his own biography as a Fluxus associate emphasizes the contradictions of the enigmatic ringleader. Was Mr. Maciunas a significant artist himself or more of an organizer? Was Fluxus an original idea or did it simply seize on a post-Dada spirit that was already fueling conceptual and performance art across the globe in the 1960s? Fluxus may have been a way for the domineering Mr. Maciunas an admirer of military history to try to conquer and monopolize the avant-garde ��� though at times he had some difficulty bending artists to his will.

It��s worth noting that Maren Ade whose ���Toni Erdmann�� is also about a German expatriate in a Balkan country is credited as a producer of ���Western.�� (Ms. Grisebach was a script consultant on ���Toni Erdmann.��) Both films combine highly specific individual narratives with sharp critical scrutiny of the way the world is organized now ��� the imbalances of power and autonomy that inevitably though not always predictably influence the ways people behave toward one another." rigorously straightforward third feature ���Western �� has at least two meanings. The German workers who come to a remote rural valley in Bulgaria to build a hydroelectric plant are emissaries of the West bringing the ambiguous benefits of capitalist development to a former Eastern Bloc nation. It��s not the first time Germans have been here as several people point out even if the crew hardly resembles an occupying army." Meinhard is like the John Wayne character interested in the ���natives�� and respectful of their customs. His boss Vincent (Reinhardt Wetrek) is a bit more like Henry Fonda: arrogant incurious convinced of his own superiority. When he harasses Vyara (Vyara Borisova) a local woman who is swimming near the German camp he threatens to put the whole enterprise at risk. The possibility of violence buzzes in the air like insects in the summer heat." surrounded by a local population that is wary of their presence and sometimes hostile to it. The Germans live in a camp some distance from the nearest village whose residents most of them regard with contempt. The exception is Meinhard (Meinhard Neumann) who is older than most of his colleagues and has a different work history. A haggard loner with a thousand-yard stare and a melancholy air he claims to be a former soldier who has been in inhospitable places before. He befriends some of the Bulgarians which spreads tension in every direction." �� Adrian says ruefully as matters seem to be coming to a head. It��s something of a rebuttal to Meinhard��s earlier observation that the one consistent truth of the human condition is the domination of the weak by the strong. But there are different kinds of strength and there are also other factors at work including laziness whim habit and random chance. The western as a genre like Meinhard believes in determinism in a history governed by laws and patterns. ���Western�� has its doubts." but it also might be simpler. The friendship between Meinhard and Adrian (Syuleyman Alilov Lefitov) a local landowner and businessman is direct and affectionate and the actors show how intimacy can develop without a common language. Meinhard nicknamed the ���legionnaire �� is jokingly described as Adrian��s bodyguard and events will test the extent and intensity of his loyalty." Ms. Grisebach plays with the implications of the western and the expectations of the audience. At various points we may think we know where the story is heading ��� sometimes dreading an inevitable tragedy sometimes embracing a promise of reconciliation or redemption ��� but the film is as full of detours and switchbacks as the mountain roads its characters must negotiate." even to themselves. Meinhard comes across as more sensitive more stoical and tougher than his colleagues ��� more of a man in the old gunslinger ethos ��� but it��s possible that he overestimates his own mastery of a complex situation. It��s also possible that his displays of decency toward the villagers are motivated by selfishness as much as altruism and that he may not be the righteous nice guy they take him for."

The level of animus feels as contrived as it is narratively useful as is often the case in the bad-party movie itself at times a subset of the confined-space flick.

Mr. Nguyen whips up a spectral stew of past atrocities and present-day hanky-panky. Lush verdant exteriors ��� vibrantly photographed by Sam Chase ��� define a plantation where according to Sebastien��s garrulous cook hundreds of Vietnamese workers were brutalized. Bleeding foliage and a mass grave back her up but the movie��s invocation of slavery and Holocaust-like imagery feels overshadowed and muted by its soapy center." Derek Nguyen��s ���The Housemaid�� wraps a painful chapter in Vietnamese history in Gothic-melodrama trappings. The result is a good-looking but overstuffed genre pileup that confuses as often as it compels." the story ��� inspired by the recollections of Mr. Nguyen��s grandmother a former housemaid ��� takes place on a sprawling rubber plantation belonging to Sebastien (Jean-Michel Richaud) a handsome French officer. When an orphan named Linh (Nhung Kate) joins his small house staff she enters a terrifying world where creaks and whispers and vibrating strings follow her from room to room. Everyone it seems harbors shameful secrets not least the house itself where Sebastien��s wife and baby died and a wraithlike apparition flits and hovers."

�� its protagonist Chlo� (Marine Vacth) is seen getting her hair cut. Her wet hair pale face and the gray background impart a simple elegance to the sequence. The following scene takes place in the bleaker confines of a gynecologist��s office. In one shot the screen fills with the colors pink and silver. Viewers may wonder exactly what they are seeing at first but as the camera zooms out it becomes clear: a speculum seen from the point of view of a doctor conducting a vaginal examination. The shot dissolves into a geometrically corresponding close-up of Chlo���s eye." but Ms. Vacth who worked with Mr. Ozon on the 2014 film ���Young and Beautiful �� does more than hold her own opposite him. She modulates Chlo���s mood from slumping vulnerability to hip-swinging confidence from a whirlpool of self-doubt and near despair to defiance. ���Double Lover�� is as much if not more Ms. Vacth��s movie as it is the director��s." the recurring spiral staircases and so much else engulfing Chlo� make this thriller unusually engrossing. ���Double Lover�� nods a bit to David Cronenberg��s ���Dead Ringers�� (1988) and Roman Polanski��s ���The Tenant�� (1976) two arguably classic thrillers on doppelg�_ngers and madness and Mr. Ozon��s stylistic gymnastics sometimes bring to mind Brian De Palma who made a film about good/bad twins early in his career. But ���Double Lover �� which Mr. Ozon ���freely adapted�� from the Joyce Carol Oates book ���Lives of the Twins �� spins its influences into a frenzy that ultimately reveals the story to be very much its own thing. And a crazy and eventually strangely moving thing it is. As elaborate as its visuals are the movie is also intimate. There aren��t many characters besides Chlo� and the twins which adds to the frisson late in the movie when the great Jacqueline Bisset makes her entrance." the film��s director (his best known films include the thrillers ���See the Sea�� and ���Swimming Pool��); the juxtaposition is very Georges Bataille (he wrote a piece of outr� eroticism titled ���Story of the Eye��). Some might say it��s all very French and perhaps it is. But it does make one sit up and take notice. The clever thing about it is that it��s not until the movie is almost over that the viewer can fully understand this imagery as something more than an effective but perhaps idle provocation." looking underweight has complained about chronic stomach pains to her gynecologist. And on that doctor��s advice she starts seeing a psychoanalyst Paul (J�r�mie Renier). He��s handsome gentle compassionate. He ���cures�� her they confess romantic feelings for each other and they move in together. One small glitch is that he does not much care for her cat Milo. A bigger glitch comes soon after that: Chlo� meets another psychoanalyst Paul��s double who claims to be his twin brother. He��s a rougher character who likes his own cat a specimen of a rare breed. He thinks he can cure Chlo� of a new complaint and there��s lots of athletic sex involved in the treatment."

She answers it herself: ���Wasteland.�� To which Jess gently responds: ���Heavy handed and dramatic minus five points.�� It��s a small recognizably true and complex moment as Sam��s self-absorption is met by a sisterly reality check. Each smiles ��� one weakly yet warmly the other almost fitfully ��� and then Sam abruptly asks if Buddy is seeing another woman." jealousy and deficiency�� would make a fitting alternate title for ���Golden Exits �� the latest from the writer-director Alex Ross Perry. These words are spoken fairly late in the movie which traces the emotional and psychological architecture of two intersecting groups of men and women. For the most part they make an absurdly comic at times pitifully narcissistic assembly ��� you laugh at them and then you cringe. White and mostly comfortably middle-class or bourgeois adjacent they have nice homes jobs and people they love and some they scarcely tolerate. They also have a lot of time to talk about themselves and their discontent which eats at some and all but consumes others." youth and novelty ��� disturbs the fragile geometry created by Nick Alyssa and Alyssa��s supremely thorny self-satisfied sister Gwen (a peerless Mary-Louise Parker). Together these three mirror a younger trio that enters when Naomi meets up Buddy (Jason Schwartzman) a childhood acquaintance who runs a recording studio with his wife Jess (Analeigh Tipton). Buddy seems charmed by Naomi but he too is discomforted almost destabilized by her. When Buddy first tells Jess about his plans to meet up with an old acquaintance he agitatedly paces the room eliding specifics only to blurt ���it��s a her �� as if he were confessing a sin. ���Sorry if that was unclear.��" a period marked by time stamps (���April 12��) the triangulated relationships among these disparate characters shift overlap and almost collapse with near-mathematical precision. Much of the movie takes place in rooms that are either modestly sized (Nick��s broom closet of an office) or are framed and shot to convey constriction and limitation. Working with a low budget that never becomes a hindrance Mr. Perry uses exterior space to convey interiority as when Alyssa speaks to Nick ��� who keeps his back to her ��� from across a room that feels like a vast unpassable chasm. (The director of photography is Sean Price Williams; the editor is Robert Greene.)" some Oedipal. ���Golden Exits�� is partly indebted to Woody Allen and Eric Rohmer cinematic patriarchs with long shadows. Mr. Perry has a thing for celebrated fathers: the dead painter in ���Queen of Earth �� the monstrous literary legend in ���Listen Up Philip.�� In ���Golden Exits �� the legacy of Alyssa and Gwen��s father hangs over their lives and can feel like a rebuke to their pettiness and navel gazing. It��s difficult to imagine these self-involved sisters having a legacy that��s worth archiving which also seems to be part of their father��s endowment." jealousy and deficiency �� a phrase that the determinedly unhappy Sam unloads on Naomi. Sam is holding forth on relationships but as is often true of most everyone in ���Golden Exits �� she is also talking about herself. ���My problem is that personal dynamics ebb and flow �� she says though it��s obvious she has no idea what her problem is. Sam wants to leave her job ���on a high note a perfect final moment�� (a phrase that seems to nod at the film��s title). She adds that ���family doesn��t afford that endless optimism for happy endings.�� There��s something in her pessimism but as Sam keeps talking ��� and talking ��� about herself both Naomi and the world slip away." prettily tree-lined corner of Brooklyn where even the most populated streets feel empty. The story��s hub is a newly arrived young Australian Naomi (Emily Browning) who has taken a temporary job with an archivist Nick (Adam Horovitz). He��s married to Alyssa (Chlo� Sevigny) a therapist and is organizing his dead father-in-law��s papers or ���materials �� as he testily puts it. Nick and Alyssa��s marriage seems locked in a slow-moving death spiral. ���Do I need to be worried about Naomi?�� Alyssa asks. Nick who has a habit of fidgeting with his wedding ring answers no (more or less)." Gwen sits in Alyssa��s living room the two sisters talking mostly and awkwardly about Nick. They inelegantly hold glasses of wine while sitting at a distance from each other ��� an off-kilter uncomfortable arrangement that adds to the disquiet. Here as throughout the framing remains steady a visual choice that can feel like a long hard pitiless stare. The scene that follows directly echoes this one but takes place in Jess��s apartment where she��s hanging out with her sister Sam (Lily Rabe). Except that these two are intimately seated right across from each other." the 33-year-old Mr. Perry makes films that seem almost calculated to go against the grain of contemporary American independent cinema. He isn��t interested in tidy or nice stories and feelings much less lessons uplift closure or relatability. His movies are talky intimate to the point of claustrophobia and populated by characters that can be charitably described as prickly. You wouldn��t necessarily want to spend time with them in real life; among other things their foibles can feel squirmingly familiar. But Mr. Perry is such a good filmmaker that he can make the embarrassing and the unbearable insistently fascinatingly engrossing (and often funny)."

despite the fact that the film��s director is Will Gluck (an American whose prior film was the 2014 ���Annie�� remake) the mode of cheeky humor here is reasonably British. There are at least a handful of inflections of Aardman the renowned British stop-motion animation studio in this picture. The scene in which Peter his sisters Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontail and his neurotic sidekick Benjamin Bunny travel to London on a mission to find a crucial human character recalls Aardman��s ���Shaun the Sheep Movie �� from 2015. Let me be clear though: ���Shaun the Sheep Movie�� is an animation masterpiece while this film is ��_ not. For one thing it leans pretty heavily on the convention of ���comedic scenes scored to jumpy ���classic�� rock songs.�� But its story line is clean; the live-action actors particularly Rose Byrne (as Bea an artist who paints portraits of the bunnies) bring their onscreen-appeal A game; and the computer-generated animals are charming albeit lacking in the particular gentle winsomeness of Potter��s originals." the most pertinent immediate question is ���Will the kids like it?�� I don��t have any myself but for the press screening I was able (with an actual parent mind you) to host three between the ages of 5 and 7.

Your results may vary." you might have figured out quite some time ago that a cheekily self-reflexive C.G.I.-heavy treatment of the beloved character Peter Rabbit was inevitable. Over in Britain at least this development has been met with great trepidation. ���Another kids�� classic wrecked forever �� read a headline of one U.K. article last fall a review of this film��s trailer. (I still can��t get over the fact that reviewing trailers is now a thing.)" I found was not as bad as the trailer looked to many. Yes right away the movie dispenses with the sweetness and light and lyricism of the books by Beatrix Potter. A chorus of birds flying over the British countryside singing an air that sounds as if it may turn into the title song of ���The Sound of Music �� is swept out of frame to make way for blue-jacketed Peter whose wisecracks and egocentricity rather recall that of an American cartoon bunny Bugs.

At the end of ���The 15:17 to Paris �� a speech by former President Fran�_ois Hollande of France provides a touch of eloquence and a welcome flood of feeling. But the mood of the film is better captured by Mr. Skarlatos��s account of it published in news reports after the attack: ���We chose to fight and got lucky and didn��t die.��" the films of Robert Bresson and the Iranian cinema of the 1990s ��� but it remains a rarity in Hollywood. Usually the most we can expect is a poignant end-credits glimpse of the real people our favorite movie stars have pretended to be for the previous two hours. After all part of the appeal of movies ���inspired by true events�� is the chance to admire the artistry of actors (like Tom Hanks��s say in Mr. Eastwood��s ���Sully��) as they communicate the grit and gumption of ordinary Americans in tough circumstances." which is where we meet them played by Cole Eichenberger (Spencer Stone) Paul-Mikel Williams (Anthony Sadler) and Bryce Gheisar (Alek Skarlatos). Alek and Spencer whose mothers (Judy Greer and Jenna Fischer) are friends pull their sons out of public school and enroll them in a Christian academy where they meet Anthony a regular visitor to the principal��s office." their inner lives the subject of speculation. You can wonder about the sorrow in Alek��s eyes about the hint of a temper underneath Spencer��s jovial energy about Anthony��s skeptical detachment.

including the binary opposition that tends to shape our discourse on race. Life in Wakanda is at once urban and rural futuristic and traditional technological and mystical. Spaceships zoom over soaring buildings with thatched tops; a hover train zips over a market with hanging woven baskets. In one of the most striking locales an open-air throne room is horizontally lined with suspended tree limbs creating a loose pattern that pointedly blurs the divide between the interior and exterior worlds and is echoed by the fretwork in costumes and other sets." Wakanda itself is finally the movie��s strength its rallying cry and state of mind. Early on a white character carelessly describes it as ���a third world country ��� textiles shepherds cool outfits.�� Part of the joke which the movie wittily engages is that Wakanda certainly fits that profile except that its shepherds patrol the border with techno-wizardry and its textiles and costumes dazzle because of the country��s secret vibranium sauce. More critically having never been conquered Wakanda has evaded the historical traumas endured by much of the rest of Africa freeing it from the ravages of both colonialism and postcolonialism." ���Black Panther�� creates wonder with great flair and feeling partly through something Hollywood rarely dreams of anymore: myth. Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only to hit the same exhausted story and franchise-expanding beats. Not this one. Its axis point is the fantastical nation of Wakanda an African Eden where verdant-green landscapes meet blue-sky science fiction. There spaceships with undercarriages resembling tribal masks soar over majestic waterfalls touching down in a story that has far more going for it than branding." Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis having a conspicuously very good time) an underworld arms dealer with a weaponized arm an Afrikaans sneer and a rampaging cohort that includes Erik Killmonger (Mr. Jordan). As his name announces Killmonger has well issues to go with his striking body ornamentation. The band��s evildoing ways attract the attention of the Black Panther and an international lawman in the person of a friendly C.I.A. agent (the customarily cuddly Martin Freeman) whose good-guy status is just one reminder that ���Black Panther�� adheres to at least some dubious Hollywood conventions." not in terms of Manichaean good guys and bad but as a means to explore larger human concerns about the past the present and the uses and abuses of power. That alone makes it more thoughtful about how the world works than a lot of mainstream movies even if those ideas are interspersed with plenty of comic-book posturing. It wouldn��t be a Marvel production without manly skirmishes and digital avatars. Yet in its emphasis on black imagination creation and liberation the movie becomes an emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present. And in doing so opens up its world and yours beautifully." the story has a lot of moving parts but in general the results don��t register as the same-old superhero busywork the kind that makes for forgettable stories and strenuously overinflated running times. Written by Mr. Coogler and Joe Robert Cole ���Black Panther�� brings T��Challa��s story up to the present sketches in his past and looks to his future all while clearing room for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its other unitard-wearing warriors. (Black Panther was first wedged into the forgettable ���Captain America: Civil War.��) The movie also rather too breezily establishes Wakanda as a militaristic monarchy that is nevertheless fair and democratic." a.k.a. T��Challa (Chadwick Boseman) the latest Marvel hero to leap off the comic-book page and into his own movie. Created in 1966 by Stan Lee (script) and Jack Kirby (art) the original Black Panther ��� a hepcat in a slinky suit with claws and ears ��� debuted alongside the Fantastic Four in an adventure in Wakanda which is powered by a mystery metal vibranium. It was a splashy timely entrance (the revolutionary group that shares his name officially formed that same year) and by the end of his first escapade the Four had assured T��Challa ���there��s no reason for the Black Panther��s career to come to an end!��" as the story and the Black Panther veer here and there jumping from Wakanda to Busan South Korea the filmmakers seem as if they��re simply going to deliver a remix of James Bond with a touch of Spidey shenanigans. The Black Panther even slinks into a swank casino with some backup and before long the place has erupted with the kind of choreographed mayhem that ��� as legs and gowns twirl ��� achieves liftoff. There��s also the inevitable chaotic car chase that turns Busan into a video game and dispiritingly a car commercial an egregious tie-in that is somewhat alleviated by the amusing image of a woman warrior��s bare foot putting pedal to the metal." later rampaging rhinos) and the Wakandan backdrop give the action scenes kick and actual personality but Mr. Coogler��s directing strengths are more intimate. There are sequences in ���Black Panther�� that may make you cry because of where they go and what they say but also because of the sensitivity he brings to them. He makes some savvy story choices too. And so before Mr. Serkis can steal too many scenes Mr. Coogler turns his attention to Killmonger and pushes the movie in another direction away from a white villain wronging black people to black people living their lives." even deliberate though he has his splashier freewheeling moments including some hand-to-hand grappling. (Wrestling is big in Wakanda hence a few sexy smackdowns featuring acres of bare skin and jumping muscle.) Like many other Wakandans he speaks in English with a South African lilt an accent that vividly summons up Nelson Mandela and suggests that T��Challa will soon be assuming the role of international diplomat." among them a battalion of women warriors called the Dora Milaje. These aren��t moviedom��s irritatingly token strong chicks the tough babes with sizable biceps and skills but no real roles. For all his father issues T��Challa is enveloped by women who cushion him in maternal military sisterly and scientific support. A female general (Danai Gurira) stands by his side; his baby sister (a vivacious Letitia Wright) provides gadgets and withering asides �� la Bond��s gadget guy. Angela Bassett swans in as the royal mother while Lupita Nyong��o as a spy makes the case for her own spinoff." Black Panther has undergone a variety of costume alterations and adventures in the comics some under the direction of the filmmaker Reginald Hudlin and more recently the author Ta-Nehisi Coates. To direct the first Panther movie Marvel tapped Ryan Coogler who with his last outing ���Creed �� shook the dust off the Rocky series by giving it an African-American champion played by Michael B. Jordan. For ���Black Panther �� Mr. Coogler brought back both Mr. Jordan and some former crew members ��� including Rachel Morrison the director of photography on his first feature ���Fruitvale Station�� ��� continuity that may help account for this movie��s intimacy and fluidity." whose emotional fraught back story gives the movie more heft and real-world friction than any of Marvel��s other superhero blowouts. Like a lot of adventures ���Black Panther�� turns on a familiar father-and-son drama ��� there��s an assassination a power vacuum and a somewhat reluctant heir ��� a patrilineal intrigue that is filled in here with intense face-offs involving questions of ancestry identity the African diaspora the new world and the old. One particularly moving narrative thread features Sterling K. Brown a tremulous vibrantly sensitive actor who conveys entire chapters of grief. (He could out-weep Juliette Binoche.)"

Conveniently addicted to laudanum Dr. Price is soon staggering around the labyrinthine structure besieged by generic scares: a creepy butler a rattling armoire a child in the grip of milky-eyed possession. The Hogwarts-like domicile might be swarming with staff and construction workers but not until Price arrives do the spirits hit the fan." the story centers on the eccentric Sarah Winchester (Ms. Mirren grimly determined) heiress to the rifle fortune and eager dabbler in architecture and spiritualism. Believing that she has flourished on the deaths caused by her late husband��s invention Sarah atones by constructing a vast and ever-changing mansion whose hundreds of rooms are intended to imprison evil spirits or encourage benign ones to move on." the script is as batty and clich�d as its heroine.

�� one in a series of seasonal landscapes by Pieter Bruegel the Elder dating from 1565. On the left side of the canvas a group of men and dogs can be seen walking near people clustered close to a fire and a line of buildings; the right side of the painting shows a smattering of structures in the near distance and beyond these still more distant people skating and milling about on lakes of dark ice. Over the next few minutes the painting begins to stir as smoke streams from a chimney snow falls a dog urinates against a tree and crows caw and fly." which needs no such interventions. The rest of ���24 Frames�� is more appealing. It consists of 23 segments that turn Kiarostami��s own photographs many in starkly beautiful black and white into animations of about four and a half minutes. Filled with desolate vistas a feathered and furred menagerie and multiple aperture-like windows these fragments quickly establish a moody tone and over time become dolorous refrains. Each section is divided by fades to black and individual titles (Frame 2 Frame 15) that create a kind of countdown effect." Kiarostami could set your heart to leaping with cinematic landscapes that sometimes linger longer than his stories: a rough dusty hill delineated by a zigzagging path in ���Where Is My Friend��s House?��; two travelers motoring through a swaying field in ���The Wind Will Carry Us.�� It��s no surprise then that the images in ���24 Frames�� are consistently pretty and at times striking harmoniously composed and filled with visual tension that make the shots vibrate even before something ��� birds horses an unfortunate deer or an opportunistically placed cat ��� starts moving in them.

(It was completed under the supervision of one of his sons.)" and its technical limitations prove frustrating. In a few shots snow or rain falls for instance on the same left-to-right diagonal creating a distracting pattern that suggests the software wasn��t altered for each photograph. This synthetic quality may be an intentional imitation of life; certainly it��s obvious that Kiarostami was thinking a great deal about cinema. Intriguingly while winter and all it implies loom large here they are gently offset by a glimpse of the film ���The Best Years of Our Lives�� playing on a computer as the sounds of a deeply unexpected love song fill a lonely room." Kiarostami flattens the picture turning it into a stack of horizontal wedges. In one frame a slab of darkly brooding sky seems to loom down on a skeletal railing that runs across the shot cleaving it in half. Beyond the railing water (ocean sea or lake) surges and with a bird gives the image a frisson of drama. Repeatedly a movement ��� a bird raising its head a horse its hooves ��� turns an image into a tidy narrative fragment. Every so often (a watery panorama with a balustrade tall poles and complaining gulls) the compositions seem to nod at Yasujiro Ozu the Japanese filmmaker to whom Kiarostami dedicated ���Five�� (2003) another experimental work."

The movie directed by Myles Desenberg and Paul Dugdale frequently counts down to the Hollywood Bowl show as it chronicles rehearsals and other tour stops but there��s no real suspense because the footage from that show is interspersed throughout the movie from the very beginning and the show seems to have gone off without a hitch.

I mean who can��t seem to resist the impulse to invade Earth and wipe out humanity. ���Before We Vanish �� Kiyoshi Kurosawa��s witty science-fiction chin-scratcher ��� less a horror movie than a series of musings on potentially horrifying ideas ��� addresses the question literally. It concerns a reconnaissance squad of space travelers sent to do fieldwork in our ways and habits with particular emphasis on our mental concepts." whose bloody introduction evokes teasingly and somewhat misleadingly the iconography of classic Japanese horror. She is joined by a young man (also an alien played by Mahiro Takasugi) who has latched onto a cynical journalist (not an alien played by Hiroki Hasegawa) who serves as a guide. Alien etiquette apparently discourages harvesting your guide��s concepts and the two are refreshingly forthright about their identities and intentions. Not that anyone believes them at least at first." as it tends to be in dystopian science fiction is whether we will learn or whether it��s too late for us to recover the value of the concepts that define us. Mr. Kurosawa a prolific and skilled genre master spins this parable with a light nimble touch punctuating heavy passages of exposition with punchy modest action sequences and snatches of incongruously bouncy music. There is a decided air of pastiche ��� a predigital low-budget ��80s feel ��� and the right measure of sincerity to remind you why the concept of the alien-invasion movie is one that matters to the species." which the three main aliens resolve with impressive practical acumen. For them to acquire a concept is to steal it from the person who explained it a theft that is consummated by a brisk tap on the forehead. The victim crumples to the ground (there are some variations on this procedure) and then resumes life missing a key piece of mental furniture." sexually-harassing boss robbed of ���work �� capers across the desktops of his office laughing and tossing paper airplanes. A young man who has lived for a long time as an anxious shut-in loses ���home�� and finds himself free to explore the world and embrace political causes. It almost seems as if the aliens do their unwitting hosts a favor. The catch is that they plan to exterminate us and take over the planet." Narumi (Masami Nagasawa) is dealing with a mysterious change in her husband Shinji (Ryuhei Matsuda) whose body has been taken over by one of the extraterrestrials. Their marriage was unhappy before and now it passes through an even rougher patch on the way to a charming and not altogether surprising transformation.

���Legend of the Mountain�� is often a visual ravishment. (It was shot in the South Korean countryside.) There��s a mesmerizing appeal to many of its panoramas with their variegated colors dense vegetation and drifting swirling white mist. And while King Hu certainly likes to move the camera ��� it sweeps swoops and sometime breaks into a near-run ��� he also likes to linger on images as if encouraging you to admire their compositional harmony. You can get lost in these pictorial reveries as you trace the rays of light piercing the trees brightening the dark waters and the reality-softening haze." Ho at last makes it to the outpost where a story of sorts emerges along with allies and other figures who prove more sinister. Mysterious women (the equally charismatic Hsu Feng and Sylvia Chang) come and go as does an enigmatic lama (Ng Ming-choi) with an open cherubic face and splendid yellow vestments. There are digressions and some wonderful visual fillips ��� beautifully curved trees and noble stone statues lined up like soldiers. All these attractions are a necessary balm given that Ho turns out to be a deeply uninvolving character (Mr. Shih mostly smiles grimaces or looks amazed) a wan placeholder for a character in a narratively thin film that runs over three very leisurely hours." King Hu��s ���Legend of the Mountain�� takes place (maybe as the narrator waggishly says) in the 11th century during the Song dynasty. It tells of a cheerful underemployed scholar Ho Yunqing (Shih Chun) who makes a meager living as a copyist. Soon after the movie opens he is entrusted to copy a Buddhist sutra (a dialogue or sermon) that can liberate souls stuck in limbo. Ho isn��t a believer but he needs the money and so enthusiastically heads out on a seemingly simple mission one that eventually leads to an isolated outpost where curious and curiouser things occur." King Hu (1932-1997) is best known for his wuxia films (���A Touch of Zen��) martial arts stories involving heroic deeds quests swordplay and the supernatural. ���Legend of the Mountain �� a 1979 film that has been restored to the director��s cut is more wuxia-adjacent though it does feature some fight sequences in which characters go fantastically airborne defying gravity with bounce and somersaults. Amusingly the main choice of weapons isn��t swords but drums that opponents beat ��� with insistent galloping fingers ��� to create a powerful mystical sonic force. The drumming is wonderful and suitably hypnotic even if it doesn��t necessarily pull you under the film��s own spell."

Mr. Carman insists to one of his daughters that having a black eye doesn��t count as being ���hurt�� and visits a doctor who wonders whether his symptoms indicate post-concussion syndrome.

Fighting he says allows him to feel that he likes himself. Mr. Carman is shown throughout the film as a loving parent (we see him dancing with his daughters and making them pancakes) but he can��t check his pride. Fighting means being in a cage in more than one sense." but Mr. Unay allows the movie��s themes to click into place beautifully toward the end when Mr. Carman shares a moment of rapport at a bar with a competitor ��� and learns to his surprise that his younger rival is every bit as mortal." direct-cinema style and only scant context the movie ��� the first directorial feature from Jeff Unay who has worked in visual effects ��� plunges viewers into the world of Joe Carman a mixed martial arts fighter in Washington State.

In China by contrast the revolution appeared to be successful but the full dimensions of its cruelty were not yet visible to the few visitors like Mr. Salles��s mother who were allowed into the country. Mr. Salles who seems broadly sympathetic to the traditions of the international left (his brother is Walter Salles director of ���The Motorcycle Diaries��) nonetheless disdains the easy sentimentality of lost causes.

The most frequent visitors to Ciambra are the police and the gangsters known locally as ���the Italians �� who come to dispense assignments and collect payment. It seems inevitable that Pio will end up in trouble with one or the other." presided over by Pio��s mother daughter of the semi-mythic grandpa. Pio trails after his older brother Cosimo (Damiano Amato) playing the familiar role of sidekick mascot and occasional annoyance. The younger boy is a natural watcher a close student of the ways of his elders eager to emulate them even when he doesn��t quite understand what��s going on." an immigrant from Burkina Faso who serves as a surrogate big brother while Cosimo is locked up and who is nicer to Pio in any case. He is also the boy��s guide ��� and the viewer��s ��� to a world of refugees and migrants that is both similar to that of the Roma and distinct from it. Both groups exist at the margins of Italian society despised pitied and ignored but they experience that marginality and their own uprootedness in ways that reflect radically different histories." Pio is forced to choose between solidarity and identity between friendship and blood between universalism and tribalism. His grandfather��s horse may represent a dream of freedom but freedom is not a word with a single fixed meaning.

The film named for the battered apartment complex where Pio lives provides fresh evidence of the continued vitality of the neorealist impulse as it tries to embed a fictional narrative in the actual world. It has the shape of a fable and the texture of a documentary. The actors are nonprofessionals playing versions of themselves. During the end credits the frame is filled with more than a few dozen Amatos Pio��s onscreen (and Mr. Amato��s real-world) family." which emerges slowly through the warmth and noise of Pio��s daily life leads him toward a wrenching moment of moral crisis. In its mood and methods ���A Ciambra�� pays homage to the work of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne the living masters of European realist cinema. Like the protagonists in their films Pio faces an ethical dilemma created as much by his own misjudgments as by the harshness of his circumstances. He is forced to decide before he is ready and at enormous potential cost what kind of person he wants to be." Pio (Pio Amato) a 14-year-old Roma boy living on the rough edge of the southern Italian town of Gioia Tauro sees the specter of his grandfather��s horse wandering the streets. It goes without saying that Gioia Tauro a beaten-down zone of poverty and petty crime is no place for such a noble animal. ���When we were on the road we were free �� says Pio��s grandfather ��� glimpsed as a young man in a brief opening scene ��� who watches his descendants struggle to hold onto the old ways of their wandering proudly ungovernable kind." Pio tries to fill his shoes and apply the lessons he has absorbed. He steals luggage ransoms stolen cars to their owners and contemplates bigger scores. He is cunning though not always smart and like many adolescents he vacillates between wild overconfidence and childlike na�vet�. He knows how to drive a car but not how to read. He goes wherever he pleases but is afraid of elevators and trains. He is rarely without a cigarette a habit that apparently begins among boys in his family shortly after they��re out of diapers.

(���Tall�� comes with the subtitle ���The American Skyscraper and Louis Sullivan.��) Famous for declaring that ���form must ever follow function �� Sullivan tried to find an organic authentic identity for modern tall buildings. While hardly averse to ornament he envisioned each structure as a dialectic of utility and beauty. His great disciple Frank Lloyd Wright would extend Sullivan��s philosophy in his own writings and architectural projects." toward the end of the 19th century it became possible to conceive of ordinary urban commercial and residential buildings whose height would surpass the limits of human stamina. The invention of the modern elevator by Elisha Graves Otis was crucial and so was the development of iron and steel frames that enabled lighter higher and slimmer constructions. As often happens (see also: the internet and the automobile) technological advances created aesthetic challenges. What were these gigantic new buildings supposed to look like?" partaking of the same democratic spirit that breathes in the writings of Emerson and Whitman. Sullivan appears as a prophet without much honor in his own country denied the celebrity and the lucrative commissions enjoyed by the Europe-besotted Burnham." an unassuming (though hardly unambitious) examination of a grand at times grandiose subject. Divided into clear concise chapters and conducted in a style that might be called street-corner Ken Burns this documentary directed by Manfred Kirchheimer is more essay than epic preferring coherence to comprehensiveness. In looking at a smattering of buildings in two big cities and focusing on the work of a handful of major architects Mr. Kirchheimer sketches the skyscraper as a feat of engineering a work of imagination and part of an ongoing cultural argument." the glass-and-steel boxes of the post-World War II International Style are part of Burnham��s legacy rather than Sullivan��s. ���Tall �� though it was completed in 2006 ends its story several decades earlier before the advent of postmodernist styles that might have complicated its tidy argument. But the film is useful in part because it is so frankly argumentative. The critical appreciation of art is always advanced more effectively by partisanship than by neutrality." only bigger. Mr. Kirchheimer associates this idea with Daniel Burnham the Chicago planner and architect who is in some ways the villain of ���Tall.�� Burnham whose legacy includes the grounds of the World��s Columbian Exhibition of 1893 ��� part of the backdrop of Erik Larson��s true-crime historical best seller ���The Devil in the White City�� ��� adapted ornate European styles to new uses and proportions." �� with its graceful thrifty camera work is a profoundly beautiful film and its beauty is sometimes at odds with its polemical intentions. Its form you might say departs at times from its function. There are sequences that seem intended to emphasize the ugly alienating qualities of skyscrapers that ignore or distort Sullivan��s principles.

The directors and brothers Eshom Nelms and Ian Nelms have obviously made a study of the genre both in its old and more recent iterations and while they��re happy to play around with the form they pretty much leave the basics intact. By far their smartest most inspired move is to have cleared room for John Hawkes one of those actors who are more often seen nibbling at the edges of a scene leaving perfect little teeth marks that sometimes give a movie its primary texture." Mike finds a badly beaten woman (Stefania Barr) near a field that he��s slept in after another soused night. She��s an enigma and soon his possible redemption a sacrifice to the story gods that lets him play lawman again. With a cheap business card and an equally cheap jacket and tie he smilingly ambles it into the shamus role knocking on doors and sniffing out leads among all the yammer and serviceable visuals. Before long he is chasing down a familiar dark tale of very young women and very bad men and trading patter with both a silky rich cat (Robert Forster) and a smooth pimp (Clifton Collins Jr.) who rolls up with a scowl pummeling first asking questions later." though for the most part they remain little more than satellites orbiting Mike or rather Mr. Hawkes. Even Octavia Spencer who plays Mike��s sister and as a performer can overpower her scenes never manages to wrest even the tiniest corner from Mr. Hawkes��s firmly relaxed grip. The Nelmses don��t make enough of their more intriguing ideas (Mike��s familial history) and end up right where you expect they would bang bang. But Mr. Hawkes keeps you tethered whether he��s navigating the movie��s uneven tones or peeling down one of cinema��s lonely highways in a muscle car so lovingly shot it deserves a co-star credit."

whose thin high-cheekboned face never seemed to age (as a German pilot in World War II he was wounded more than once perhaps necessitating plastic surgery; the film implies as much) almost always sported a fedora as he made pronouncements like ���Anything can be art especially anything that conserves energy.�� As both performance artist and art teacher he often comes off as a happy warrior: ���Give me a place to stand and I��ll move the earth.��" the work of the German artist Joseph Beuys is easy to dismiss. As they are preserved in museums his installations can seem like mere debris strewn across a floor. The highly praised 2017 film ���The Square�� contains a running gag about an art work that��s nothing but piles of rocks which keeps getting swept up by the cleaning staff of a museum; it��s clearly a poke at Beuys." the only really ���traditional�� art he accomplished are harrowing haunting. Even if you don��t need Beuys justified or explained to you the movie is an exhilarating portrait of a unique truth-teller." Beuys��s work was best understood with Beuys��s actual presence attached to it. But Beuys has been dead since 1986. This documentary directed by Andres Veiel using mostly archival footage makes a strong case for Beuys emphasizing the social conscience at work in his art more than the postmodern prankishness."

The over-the-top nature of the sequence (Mary��s car gets shot up enough it could double as a sieve) is not served well by Mr. Najafi��s execution.

Oh and she also selects a formidable-looking handgun from the formidable arsenal behind her wardrobe." ever simmering takes Mary��s moral conundrum very seriously. Her expressive eyes and nuanced body language work well for the character; she can put across a major change in attitude just by shifting a hip. The script though doesn��t give her a whole lot of material with which to credibly enact her character��s crisis.

Yet even though each is given a moment (a near-suicide one affair and then another) Jeanne Ariane and Gilles stick to a disappointingly familiar script.

Like chess pieces on a very small board Ariane and Jeanne advance and retreat even as Gilles remains more or less in place." Mr. Garrel fills the wide screen with a ravishment of tones from inkiest black to crystalline white and every imaginable gray in between. There��s a deceptive casualness to his visuals. Every image looks harmonious without being fastidious which means that you see the picture rather than the intention. Yet even when you see the thought behind his images the gentle disorder of his characters�� lives with their patched walls and messes creates an inviting informality that strengthens his realism. He��s a master of near-perfection of dazzlingly lit and shot wisps of hair and tear-streaked cheeks." Jeanne and Gilles head off together leaving Ariane behind. As he does elsewhere in the film Mr. Garrel introduces this interlude with a lovely piano flourish and a few words from the intermittent narrator (Laetitia Spigarelli): ���That evening Gilles went out with his daughter.�� The voice-over briefly suggests the start of a once-upon-a-time story yet as Jeanne and Gilles walk and talk the scene becomes something far more enchanting: two people whose unforced intimacy speaks to a bond that feels shaped by a shared history rather than clich�s." ���What will you do with your life?�� He and Jeanne have stopped walking and as they stand facing each other on a quiet sidewalk you sense that something consequential is about to happen.

One of her strongest characters turns out to be an unnamed slave (Toumani Kouyat� excellent) who��s part of a new group that Antonio brings to the farm. A ferociously charismatic presence this man serves as the group��s leader and insistently speaks up commanding attention with each utterance.

In spite of their mutual hostility he and Tony have a lot in common. They are both hard workers and good husbands and each is a victim of his own stubbornness as well as of the other��s provocations. Tony is more of a hothead while Yasser is more likely to seethe in silence but they share an inclination to value dignity more than common sense and to see humiliation as a kind of existential death." happy movie about the Middle East may be too much to ask for right now. But ���The Insult�� is too energetic to be depressing. Sometimes it��s just too energetic period. But there is something undeniably exhilarating about the film��s honest assessment of the never-ending conflict between decency and cruelty that rages in every nation neighborhood and heart." which began in the mid-70s and transformed Beirut from a symbol of Mediterranean elegance into a synonym for Middle Eastern chaos ���The Insult�� is a fascinating history lesson.

Neither man really intends for things to escalate the way they do nor can either figure out how to back down without a loss of face that would also feel like a betrayal.

You could also put it the other way around. The film directed by Ziad Doueiri (���West Beirut �� ���The Attack��) reveals how large-scale social divisions infect even the most banal daily interactions." ���The Insult �� is not always subtle. As the trial progresses it becomes more programmatic confronting the viewer and the characters with reminders of past atrocities that sometimes feel heavy-handed.

At several moments you expect a sentimental uplifting solution the hug or handshake that assures everyone that bygones will be bygones that deep down we��re all the same. But that would be a lie. The more complicated truth is that everyone who holds a grudge does so for a reason and fears that letting go of it would mean the loss of something precious."

�� Ms. Hamoud��s debut feature is an unusually welcoming and engaging film inviting you to become a part of the circle of friends it depicts with such energy and warmth. For that reason it can also be frustrating. So much is packed into two hours ��� so many big and small emotions events and issues so many potentially interesting people ��� that you may find yourself wanting both more and less." the three-stranded story ���In Between�� braids together might look a bit tidy and schematic but it makes its points with an impressive mixture of clarity and nuance. The central performances are all terrific. Ms. Hawa tall and glamorous with regal bearing and a cloud of curls has an effortlessly commanding presence and for a while Ms. Jammelieh and Ms. Kanboura dwell in the shadow of her charisma. But each asserts herself in a different way: Ms. Jammelieh by finding the well of emotion behind Salma��s cool cynical facade and Ms. Kanboura by locating both Nur��s toughness and her half-hidden sense of fun." multifarious problem of patriarchal authority which each of the three main characters confronts in a different guise. Wissam who at first seems like a humorless but basically well-meaning guy turns out to be something much worse. But ���In Between�� doesn��t suppose that only pious Muslim men mistreat the women in their lives. Salma who is gay faces the brutal intolerance of her Christian family while Laila finds that her dreamy artistic well-traveled boyfriend Ziad (Mahmoud Shalaby) is not as open-minded as he seemed." �� Maysaloun Hamoud��s film about three Palestinian women sharing an apartment in Tel Aviv is fatalistic about the local political situation pessimistic about men and encouraged by the power of female solidarity. In other words whether by serendipity or prophetic insight or some combination of the two it��s a perfect movie for the moment." and is part of the point ���In Between�� is making. The movie ends right at the moment when it seems as if a potentially bigger story ��� about what happens after the awakening and reckoning after the mutual recognition of #MeToo ��� could finally begin." Ms. Hamoud plays the small-scale culture-war skirmishes between Nur and the others for comedy partly because humor is Laila and Salma��s readiest defense when moments of conflict or discomfort arise. But slowly the picture darkens and you begin to understand that the independence these women enjoy comes at a serious price that their free-spiritedness results from a principled implicitly political commitment to their own autonomy." Ms. Hamoud had made a television season about Laila Salma and Nur so that the audience��s curiosity about them could have been fully satisfied and just so we could hang out with them more regularly. We barely meet Nur��s father Salma��s girlfriend or the Jewish colleague Laila flirts with on smoke breaks. All of them seem worth knowing better. The glimpses of Tel Aviv at work and play (and of Nazareth Salma��s hometown) are tantalizing. The party is over too soon!" a lawyer and Salma (Sana Jammelieh) a D.J. who supports herself with restaurant work spend their free time doing what their counterparts in Berlin New York and other big cosmopolitan cities do ��� going to clubs getting high drinking and canoodling in a large and shifting crowd of friends. When their roommate leaves the nest to marry she arranges for her cousin Nur (Shaden Kanboura) to take her place. Nur who is studying computer science is an observant Muslim who tries as politely as she can to disguise her disapproval of Laila and Salma��s hedonistic lifestyle. Nur��s fianc� Wissam (Henry Andrawes) is more blunt worrying about the state of her soul and trying to arrange for her to move somewhere else."

Here he works with his regular collaborators Evan Johnson and Galen Johnson. Commissioned by the San Francisco Film Society ��� now called SFFILM which runs the city��s main film festival ��� and Stanford Live the movie had its premiere in April with accompaniment by the Kronos Quartet which later recorded the score." Alfred Hitchcock��s depiction of San Francisco is so specific that it��s possible six decades later for viewers who know the film to stand on street corners and guess with accuracy where he placed his camera ��� even in spots where the buildings no longer exist." which is evoked with varying degrees of literalism and editing fluidity. To conjure a sense of Scottie (James Stewart) watching Madeleine (Kim Novak) at the Legion of Honor the filmmakers cut to another clip shot at the museum. When ���The Green Fog�� reaches the moment that Scottie recognizes Madeleine��s necklace the horror of that realization is captured in Donald Sutherland��s scream from the finale of ���Invasion of the Body Snatchers�� (1978)." ���The Green Fog�� is a marvel of film scholarship that looks backward and forward from the Hitchcock masterpiece. Pre-���Vertigo�� noirs like ���Dark Passage�� (1947) and ���Sudden Fear�� (1952) share the screen with films that consciously or unconsciously emulate ���Vertigo �� not the least of which is Mel Brooks��s 1977 parody ���High Anxiety.�� (It��s unclear what it says about San Francisco that it has so consistently served as a backdrop for the work of Joe Eszterhas the screenwriter of ���Jagged Edge �� ���Basic Instinct�� and ���Jade.��)" and ���The Green Fog �� perhaps for coherence��s sake frequently cuts out dialogue sometimes for comic purposes; the effect is a bit like watching a DVD that keeps skipping slightly ahead. Typically for Mr. Maddin there are also a few meta flourishes. In the weirdest characters in the 1970s police series ���McMillan & Wife�� watch a TV that thanks to some visual trickery appears to be showing ��N Sync��s video for ���This I Promise You.�� (The music video is meant to suggest Scottie and Madeleine��s walk through the redwoods shot in a similar location.)" even a little using clips from lesser directors.

It��s about money and families and the ties that bind and cut although because it was directed by Ridley Scott there isn��t a jot of sentimentalism gumming the works. In July 1973 John Paul Getty III (known as Paul) the elder Getty��s 16-year-old grandson was snatched off a street in Rome.

He likes darkness pictorially and of the soul and in Getty Sr. he has a magnificent specimen. And in Mr. Plummer he has a great actor giving a performance with a singular asterisk: In early November with the movie already done Mr. Scott hired Mr. Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey who has been accused of sexual misconduct. It was a bold move an extreme variation on leaving a performance on the cutting-room floor. The 88-year-old Mr. Plummer isn��t fully persuasive when briefly playing the younger Getty Sr. even in long shot.

She rejects the shabby bargain Reynolds offers her which demands the complete suppression of her will in exchange for his occasional recognition of her existence. ���I live here �� she says to a client who might otherwise have assumed she was just another seamstress. She fights for her position in the household trying to outmaneuver Cyril and to force Reynolds to recognize her as his equal. There is some temerity in this and some novelty in the way Mr. Anderson depicts their relationship. The wives of artists in movies and literature tend to be doormats or helpmeets and their psychic anguish and creative fire rarely move from background to center stage." shallow materialism ��� may explain some of the temperamental quirks that Reynolds shares with his creator. Over the years especially since ���There Will Be Blood �� Mr. Anderson has repeatedly manifested his indifference to the fashions and conventions of contemporary filmmaking. In particular he disdains the careful self-conscious husbanding of themes and messages that preoccupies many of his peers. He always seems more interested in what his movies are than in what they��re about or who they might be for." subject to the whims of the market and the vagaries of taste and therefore easy to trivialize. It��s just a movie. It��s just a dress. When Reynolds��s sister and business partner Cyril (Lesley Manville) informs him of the departure of a longtime client for a house she regards as more ���chic �� the designer has a small tantrum. The word disgusts him not least because it expresses the vulgarity of the environment in which he must pursue his lofty visions." who butters her toast too noisily pours tea with too much splashing and boldly asserts her right to exist as something more than an ornament in the Woodcock household. The battle of wills that ensues ��� a two-front war for Alma who must contend with both Woodcock siblings ��� is the film��s dramatic furnace and its comic engine. The three main performances are each as richly textured and subtly shaded as the clothes. Mr. Day-Lewis composes a symphony of moods: sardonic melancholy inspired impatient. But he is matched by Ms. Krieps an actress from Luxembourg as canny and unintimidated as Alma herself. Is this collaboration or competition? A tango or a tennis match? Whatever it is this partnership is thrilling to watch: funny wrenching full of large and small surprises." the captivating strangeness of the mood and the elegant threading of the plot are likely to hold your attention but later you can go back to savor the lustrous colors the fine-grained performances and the romantic mystery that holds the whole thing together." a couturier plying his trade in London in the 1950s has a habit of sewing secret messages into his garments. (���Never cursed�� is the blessing stitched in lavender thread that he slips into the hem of a wedding gown commissioned by a princess.) These invisible traces of his hand ��� hidden meanings in the literal sense ��� signify that his dresses are more than luxurious commodities. They are works of art obscurely and yet unmistakably saturated with the passion and personality of their creator." ���Phantom Thread �� which chronicles a few chapters in Reynolds��s fictional life and career. This is a profoundly intensely extravagantly personal film. I don��t mean autobiographical. I know little and care less about the details of Mr. Anderson��s personal life. Whether or not his longtime partner the actress and comedian Maya Rudolph has ever cooked him a mushroom omelet is a matter of complete indifference to me." comic study of the asymmetries and conflicts at the heart of a marriage. A refined gothic nightmare in the manner of Henry James. A perverse psychological fable of unchecked ego and unhinged desire. That��s a partial catalog and one that can��t quite capture how bizarre this movie is. Or how bizarrely true to life ��� to art to love to itself ��� it feels." but ���Phantom Thread�� almost offhandedly lays out intriguing analogies between Reynolds��s m�tier and Mr. Anderson��s. The fashion designer played by Daniel Day-Lewis turns drawings into drama manipulating color and movement and the human form to construct a material object that is also artificial idealized and fantastical ��� a commodity that impersonates a dream. He is assisted in his labor by a crew of disciplined artisans who cut and stitch his ideas into usable form. (This may be the place to note that the editor of ���Phantom Thread�� is Dylan Tichenor. Mark Bridges designed the costumes. Mr. Anderson served as his own director of photography.)" a non-British waitress in a provincial British restaurant who becomes Reynolds��s model mistress and muse. Usually this is a temporary assignment. We briefly meet Alma��s predecessor Johanna (Camilla Rutherford) who annoys Reynolds at breakfast and is dismissed offscreen by Cyril with one of Reynolds��s old dresses as a consolation prize. Johanna��s sin is to request some of her lover��s attention a demand he regards as intrusive and distracting." ���Phantom Thread�� reverses itself almost imperceptibly flipping from Reynolds��s point of view to Alma��s and back again. She succumbs at first to what is most likely a well-practiced campaign of seduction: Reynolds flirts with her at breakfast invites her to dinner takes her back to his country house and sets about making her a dress. What she regards as her physical flaws ��� small breasts broad shoulders wide hips ��� he sees as signs of perfection. She is dazzled by his ability to be dazzled by her."

though Mr. Sorkin modestly amends it for dramatic purposes. It begins with an early devastating life-altering ski-crash that occurs when Molly is an Olympic hopeful. Her slope dreams having come to an end she postpones law school and moves to Los Angeles. (���I wanted to be young for a while in warm weather.��) There she flops in a friend��s apartment and ends up working at a club hustling overpriced vodka to guys who think they��re players. She catches the eye of one Dean (Jeremy Strong) who hires her to help run a high-end poker game where the first buy-in is $10 000." �� which mostly tracks how a shrewd young woman threw fancy gambling parties for very important and self-important men with exceedingly deep pockets. Once Molly has stopped Googling her entrepreneurial juices start flowing and she realizes that she could be running her own lucrative game. She does setting one up at a fancy hotel and trading her nice-girl blah for showier makeup designer threads and deeper d�colletage. The players follow her including a major star known only as Player X who Michael Cera ��� in a wonderful insinuatingly creepy performance ��� turns into a portrait of Hollywood entitlement and moral rot." �� because despite Ms. Chastain��s charisma and gift for delivering Mr. Sorkin��s fast talk Molly isn��t interesting. Things happen to her but most of the action and fun is at the table. Mr. Sorkin has written some sharp characters and cast them accordingly tapping actors like Mr. Strong Chris O��Dowd and a terrific Bill Camp the protagonist in an affecting mini-tragedy in three acts (stoicism disintegration and heartbreak). All the while Molly smiles on the side suffers a setback moves to New York and racks up big money from card games that at their best turn into condensed pocket-size dramas by turns triumphant and catastrophic." absorbing the game��s rituals and language while charming the all-male players. She��s a quick study and a committed Googler looking up poker terminology and music for gambling away money (Kenny Rogers). With his editors Mr. Sorkin gives Molly��s poker education snap cutting from shot to shot ��� from a drink being poured to a slammed-down stack of chips ��� and turning images into near-hieroglyphics. One of the editors Alan Baumgarten worked on David O. Russell��s ���American Hustle �� a movie that like ���Molly��s Game �� owes a large debt to Martin Scorsese��s native-son crime stories including ���Casino.��" partly through her legal troubles. Soon after the movie opens the F.B.I. busts her which leads her to Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba) an expensive lawyer who becomes her passionate champion. This gives Mr. Sorkin a second line of action (and an office for discussions) allowing him to switch between Molly��s high-flying past (shuffle deal play) and her present-day troubles. As the story unfolds the past catches up to the present and Mr. Sorkin keeps trying to invest Molly��s story with meaning mostly through a little family psychodrama and some deeply unpersuasive feminism including by casting her as a victim of men." �� Aaron Sorkin��s directorial debut; they��re smashed like racquetballs. Life comes at you fast and so do the words that rush out of Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) as she relays her tale. A poker entrepreneur who ran a high-stakes game before slamming into trouble Molly is a speed-talker and somewhat of a close one too. She delivers stretches of her story in a voice-over that suggests that Mr. Sorkin wrote and directed his movie with a stopwatch in one hand and a DVD of Howard Hawks��s motor-mouth comedy ���His Girl Friday�� in the other." which sounds about right for the tempo Mr. Sorkin has embraced in ���Molly��s Game.�� Its titular poker princess is based on the real Molly Bloom who had a moment a while back when she was busted for running a high-stakes game her world imploding when the F.B.I. came knocking. She wrote a book naming players in games she helped run and others she ran ��� Leonardo DiCaprio Ben Affleck and Tobey Maguire ��� which earned her acreage in Vanity Fair magazine. Her book��s full title is: ���Molly��s Game: From Hollywood��s Elite to Wall Street��s Billionaire Boys Club My High-Stakes Adventure in the World of Underground Poker.��" after Molly loses one game she speaks of her ���powerlessness over the unfair whims of men.�� But while it��s silly it��s also patronizing because by attempting to portray Molly as any kind of female victim ��� and by glossing over her culpability ��� Mr. Sorkin only ends up denying this character her agency. Just as dubiously when Molly is at her most vulnerable he trots out a series of male authority figures including her estranged father (Kevin Costner) who speak at and for her who excuse her past vouch for her character and enthuse about her future. They replace all the slick bros at the poker table and taken together make quite a paternal choir." altogether too feebly to put a feminist spin on a woman who made bank through an illegal gambling ring. Empowerment is one way to look at this story though only if you sentimentalize its main character. It is hard not to wonder how this movie might have turned out if Mr. Sorkin had decided his protagonist was as much a weasel as the one he wrote for ���The Social Network �� another story of an American striver. It��s hard not to wonder too how this story might play if its protagonist wasn��t a woman who as this movie sees it needed so much male defending."

its reason for being. And as that challenge becomes a crusade it leads to some lump-in-the-throat grandstanding about the press and its relationship to power. Ben and Katharine each have friends in high government places. These allegiances ��� to friends to state authority ��� are tested by the Pentagon Papers if rather more tested perhaps for the purposes of this fiction. Graham��s husband Phil and Bradlee were both close with John F. Kennedy. In her memoirs Graham writes that her friend McNamara helpfully advised The Times on a legally sensitive letter about the Pentagon Papers a detail that underscores the depth of these powerful allegiances." shaping a drama around a newspaper that didn��t break the story seems an odd path to Hollywood triumphalism though the scrappy Post was itching to be a national player. There��s also the matter of the actual import of the Pentagon Papers. In his memoir Ben Bradlee The Post��s longtime editor ��� winningly played by Tom Hanks with macho suavity and an on-and-off Boston accent ��� devotes four times as much space to Watergate (a story that his paper did break) as to the Pentagon Papers. Except that ���The Post�� cares less about the hard-charging Bradlee than it does his boss Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) the paper��s late-blooming publisher." jolting out of a slumber a sly preview of larger awakenings to come both her own and that of the country. She��s about to take her company public a move that she and a close adviser (Tracy Letts wry and tart) hope will financially stabilize it. During the week that this business is finalized though the company will be temporarily vulnerable to its underwriters. The stock offering Graham writes in her memoir was scheduled for June 15. Two days later The Post had the Pentagon Papers. What happened next is a matter of record history being the ultimate spoiler. The pleasure of ���The Post�� is how it sweeps you up in how it all went down." it revisits The Washington Post��s decision to publish portions of the Pentagon Papers an immense classified report that chronicled America��s involvement in Southeast Asia from World War II to 1968. In Mr. Spielberg��s hands that decision becomes a ticktock thriller about the freedom of the press the White House��s war on that constitutional right and the middle-aged woman who defended freedom in a fabulous gold caftan." a twinned metamorphosis that in turn speaks to the larger cultural and social changes shaking the country. Time and again men crowd over and around Katharine walking in front of her speaking for her. As the drama heats up the typewriters furiously clack ��� and the political becomes increasingly personal and the personal turns political ��� Katharine finds both a new purpose and identity. With small tilts of her head darting looks nervous flutters and a Brahmin imperiousness that gradually eases and warms Ms. Streep creates an acutely moving portrait of a woman who in liberating herself helps instigate a revolution." ���The Post�� gently traces the arc of history while also bending it for dramatic punch and narrative expediency. The filmmakers fold in atmospheric true-to-life details like the poster for the western film ���Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid�� (a favorite of the real Mr. Ellsberg) that Daniel and some longhair pals sweep past on their way to illegally copying the Pentagon Papers. And while it��s no surprise that the movie omits and elides important players and crucial episodes its honed focus jibes with the view of the former New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis who wrote that the ���public disclosure of the Pentagon Papers challenged the core of a president��s power: his role in foreign and national security affairs.��" a government analyst on a data-mining mission in Vietnam pecking out reports on his portable typewriter amid exploding bombs and flowing blood. The secretary of defense Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood wearing a frozen smile and an oil slick of hair) thinks the war is going badly but grossly mischaracterizes American progress to journalists. Disillusioned with the official script Daniel eventually goes cloak-and-dagger rogue and is on his way to publicizing the Pentagon Papers a momentous decision that Mr. Spielberg enlivens with spooky shadows and what may be the most nervous-making photocopying in film history." what Mr. Ellsberg once described as ���evidence of lying by four presidents and their administrations over twenty-three years to conceal plans and actions of mass murder.�� Mr. Ellsberg didn��t stop the war but he did assert our right and obligation to challenge absolute power. That may be why the filmmakers ��� the script is by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer ��� slip in a bit from a speech that Mario Savio delivered two years before ���The Post�� opens and which memorably asserts: ���There��s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious makes you so sick at heart that you can��t take part!��" relying on heroes and villains. Yet given the recent assaults on journalism and the truth this heroizing is also irresistible. And Mr. Spielberg a shrewd entertainer who can be waylaid by moralism rarely lets virtue drag this movie down. He lightens the heaviness with humor physical comedy (fumbling stumbling) and a perfectly synced cast that includes the funnymen David Cross Zach Woods and a terrific Bob Odenkirk. As a filmmaker Mr. Spielberg invariably comes down on the side of optimism; here that hopefulness feels right. It also feels like a rallying cry." it went down fast a pace that Mr. Spielberg conveys with accelerated rhythms flying feet racing cameras and an enjoyably loose approach to the material. With his virtuosic veteran crew Mr. Spielberg paints the scene vividly and with daubs of beauty; most notably he creates distinct visual realms for the story��s two main overlapping at times colliding worlds. Katharine reigns over one; at first she��s all but entombed in her darkly lighted wood-paneled empire. Ben rules the other overseeing the talking and typing warriors of the glaring noisily freewheeling newsroom. (The costume designer Ann Roth subtly brightens Katharine taking her from leaden gray to free-flowing gold.)" the Marine turned government researcher turned clandestine peacenik who first gave the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times. The Times began running portions on June 13 1971. After the attorney general John Mitchell accused The Times of violating the Espionage Act a judge ordered it to stop publishing the papers. At a pivotal time in American history the government was preventing the press from getting the news out on the grounds that it would do injury to national security. Shortly thereafter The Post which had been publishing rewrites of The Times��s articles began running its own excerpts becoming part of a Supreme Court showdown over the First Amendment."

in that there is a bigger picture outside of this chronicle of self-absorption. The Laurents as what some would call wealth creators have in Mr. Haneke��s view some responsibility to and for a whole class of people who aren��t even abstractions to them. Aside from their servants members of the working class ��� both the documented and undocumented ��� are not often seen in this movie but the times they are made visible are significant. They appear at key points in the movie as when Georges in a wheelchair after his attempted suicide-by-car fails rolls down a street festooned with tacky little shops and stops in front of a group of men most likely African immigrants. We can��t hear what he��s asking of them but we can guess. The character��s presumption is staggering on several levels." it will come as no surprise that he does not regard instant messaging and smartphones as positive developments for humanity. His latest picture ���Happy End �� begins with the middle of its wide-screen frame taken up by the perfectly centered image of a phone its camera eavesdropping on a middle-age woman whose bathroom door is open as she prepares for bed. The unseen voyeur texts snide commentary on the woman��s routine." whose technical mastery often makes his considered existential dyspepsia easier to swallow doesn��t establish an explicit motivation for the spy ��� the 13-year-old Eve the second-youngest member of the singularly unhappy Laurent family whose story this movie tells. The Laurents a most high-bourgeois clan are besieged by trouble. Its patriarch Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) retains some mental sharpness in his 80s but he��s losing his memory and he��d like to get out ��� that is die ��� while he still has some faculties left. His son Thomas (Mathieu Kassovitz) has brought his daughter Eve (Fantine Harduin) to stay with him and his new wife and baby after Eve��s mother attempted suicide. (Thomas also has a mistress whom Eve learns about while cyber-eavesdropping on her father.) They are all living in the family��s Calais mansion with Eve��s aunt Anne (Isabelle Huppert) who is trying to keep the family construction business afloat a task not helped much by her wayward son Pierre (Franz Rogowski) or a fatal accident at a building site." but Mr. Haneke presents his scenes with little or no connective tissue. Instead of conventional transitions there are abrupt shifts that resemble clicking through channels on a television. A scene of domestic disorder will cut to a web video in which an adolescent boy giddily chronicles his hair and skateboarding styles from videos past and the movie lets this clip roll on quite a while before showing us that it��s something Eve is watching on her computer. This strategy has a distancing effect but also forces the viewer to stay on his or her toes." ���Happy End�� is set in France and features a mostly French-speaking cast. It has an uncommonly strong ensemble cast (including Toby Jones who plays Anne��s English lover and business ally) but the movie belongs to Mr. Trintignant. At the height of his career his nuanced performing mode achieved an almost supernatural perfection whether he was playing a romantically hapless intellectual (in ���My Night at Maud��s �� released in the United States in 1970) a stoic racecar driver (in ���A Man and a Woman �� 1966) or a fascist dupe (in ���The Conformist �� 1970). Here he is both steely and vulnerable in a role in which he has almost no physical movements to perform. In the movie��s central scene a long conversation with the troubled Eve he merely has to move his head forward or crook a finger to throw a world out of its orbit."

an Omaha couple played by Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig discover. Compared with their regular-size lives of compromised dreams and diminished expectations downsizing promises luxury and abundance. Once they liquidate their modest assets they can move into a mansion in a planned community called Leisureland and pursue a guilt-free vision of material happiness. The hard sell is provided at a surreal seminar by Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern. What could go wrong?" commercial use. People are efficiently and almost painlessly shrunk to around four or five inches. This is sold as an environmental panacea: Our tiny selves will take less of a toll on the earth��s resources and produce less waste. The burden we impose on our hot crowded planet is expected to decrease proportionally." ���Downsizing �� doesn��t go nearly as far. Surveying a landscape of impending ecological catastrophe it proposes a future that is only mildly dystopian and prescribes laughter rather than apocalyptic despair as if not exactly a remedy then at least an acceptable palliative. We don��t need to disappear altogether but it might be better all around if we weren��t so darn big." big and small is just interesting enough to be good company. He is friendly but with that hint of heartland hostility that is layered into every Alexander Payne hero��s temperament like a smear of hot mustard in a bologna-and-cheese sandwich. Paul��s passivity gives the movie a leisurely rhythm unusual in both science fiction and satire the two genres that ���Downsizing�� nods toward without fully embracing." ���War for the Planet of the Apes �� posited near-total human extinction as a more-or-less happy ending. A radically dystopian future seems like the best we deserve these days and it was impressive to see a summer blockbuster offer such harsh medicine." yes as it turns out. But then again the whole point of the movie is the scaling down of expectations to arrive at something like an accurate sense of scale and disappointment may be a perverse sign of success. ���Downsizing�� is an ambitious movie about the value of modesty and its faults are proportionate to its insights. I sort of wish it felt like a bigger deal but maybe that��s my problem." the movie resembles an episode of ���The Twilight Zone�� directed by Preston Sturges. An outlandish pointedly allegorical conceit is inhabited not by symbolic figures but by terrestrial oddballs. You don��t see this at first because Mr. Payne is so charmed by the conceit itself. Like a video gamer uninterested in winning and in no hurry to advance to higher levels he knocks around the corners and side streets of his invented reality treating it the way he treated Hawaii in ���The Descendants �� wine country in ���Sideways�� and his beloved Nebraska in most of his other movies ��� as a picturesque lived-in backdrop for the spectacle of human ridiculousness." which is a lot of fun. Mr. Payne has an admirably concrete logistical sense and an eye for amusing incongruities. The transition from big to small is full of clever touches like the spatulas that lift the newly shrunken out of their suddenly oversize beds as if they were freshly baked one-bite cookies." with a bit of a thud this kinetic and good-natured movie discovers its limitations and shrinks before our eyes. Mr. Payne and Mr. Taylor roaming freely in their conjoined imaginations wander off into the bushes and then stumble into the middle of the road. Paul��s journey loses direction and momentum and sour nagging questions begin to intrude. Haven��t we seen this story before in which a white man��s anomie is cured by the love of an exotic woman? Did we come all this way to rediscover the ouroboros of guilty liberal self-consciousness?" who wrote ���Downsizing�� with his frequent collaborator Jim Taylor zooms in on the fine print in the contract ��� in other words on the ways our ingrained fallibility upends our utopian projects. Paul having undergone the irreversible (and hilariously detailed) reduction finds himself unexpectedly alone in Leisureland. The world of ���the small�� ��� who are somehow both an oppressed minority and a privileged elite ��� is afflicted by the usual problems. Selfishness and deceit haven��t disappeared and bigger injustices still exist. Paul sees a news report about a political dissident involuntarily made tiny by an oppressive government and later discovers festering inequality around Leisureland itself. Some of the familiar contradictions of 21st-century capitalism are magnified as Paul a Gulliver gone native in Lilliput eventually discovers." ���Downsizing�� amps up that ridiculousness in risky and wonderful fashion. Just when we (along with Paul) assume we��ve figured out the rules and boundaries of this place Christoph Waltz shows up as Paul��s upstairs neighbor an international man of mystery named Dusan. Shortly thereafter Paul meets Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau) a Vietnamese dissident who becomes the agent of his ethical and romantic reawakening. For a delirious while fueled by Mr. Waltz and Ms. Chau��s zigzagging comic energies we are transported to a land beyond genre a zone of pure comic sublimity."

The result may not quite be a masterpiece but it is nonetheless a credible master��s thesis a careful and well-informed exploration of the paradoxes that are as integral to the western genre as horses whiskey and guns.

As he points out what he is condemned for having done is no different from what Blocker has spent his career doing. Only times and government policies have changed." Blocker is given what for him is a supremely distasteful mission. He must escort one of his old enemies a dying Cheyenne chief named Yellow Hawk to his ancestral lands up north. Blocker holds Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) personally responsible for the deaths of his friends and regards the government��s decision to set him free after years in captivity to be an intolerable betrayal. But duty is duty and he gathers up a posse of fine character actors (including Jesse Plemons Jonathan Majors Timoth�e Chalamet and an especially good Rory Cochrane) to accompany the chief and his family (Q��orianka Kilcher Adam Beach Xavier Horsechief and Tanaya Beatty)." at the conclusion of his magisterial three-volume study of the West in the American imagination notes that the western appearances to the contrary doesn��t have a fixed ideological meaning. We can use the mythology of the frontier he writes ���to reify our nostalgia for a falsely idealized past �� or we can use it as a way of ���imagining and speaking truth.�� ���Hostiles�� sets out to do both. It aims for epic grandeur ethical clarity and also a measure of historical credibility. This puts the movie in a state of contradiction with itself like nearly every other good western and for that matter like the United States of America." not so much a new kind of western as every possible kind ��� vintage revisionist elegiac feminist. What makes the movie interesting is the sincerity and intelligence with which it pursues that ambition heroically unaware that the mission is doomed from the start." and the Indian Wars are winding down. Capt. Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) a walking embodiment of Lawrence��s archetype has made a career of genocidal slaughter which has left him bitter but not remorseful. Blocker is no brute: He reads Julius Caesar in the original Latin. And he hates Indians with a righteous purity that is shocking to contemplate now but was hardly abnormal in those days." �� for all its earnest maneuvering to stay both true to history and on the right side of it nonetheless sits a bit uncomfortably in the present. It is unlikely to escape notice that this is yet another tale of a white man��s conscience which uses Yellow Hawk and his children and grandchildren as vehicles for Blocker��s awakening. Whether this awakening is complete and whether the film��s final notes of absolution are fully earned are matters worth arguing about." whose family has been slaughtered by Comanches. Her presence allows Blocker to show his compassionate side and alters the relations between the Cheyenne and the soldiers.

In general those few white people who speak up in the movie against white brutality are viewed with contempt even as the agents of that brutality are offered a chance at redemption. The moral economy of ���Hostiles�� dictates that only those who have made war can participate in the regenerative violence that leads toward peace."

P.T. Barnum remains firmly lodged in the public imagination because of his gift for blurring the line between truth and fiction. When he presented the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington as a star attraction some of his audience knew she was phony others did not and then there were those who did not care and went along for the ride. There��s pleasure in a good fib (spoiler alert: Santa) as well as political advantage. When compared to Barnum last year Donald Trump responded: ���We need P.T.

But they are all awkward fits for this material. The songs which shift from defiant pop anthems to melodramatic ballads do not evoke the circus or at least not the American version. Their soupy soulfulness belongs to Cirque du Soleil more than Ringling Brothers. And while Mr. Jackman is a dashing presence with an easy smile his earnest performance could use a few knowing winks.

The first-time director Michael Gracey achieves an aggressively synthetic style through kinetic editing and tidy underdog stories but none of the true joy of pulling a fast one. It��s a standard-issue holiday biopic one that tells a story about a populist entertainer hungry for highbrow respect the joys of showbiz and the price of ambition. An amusement park version of P.T. Barnum is fine as far as that goes but if you are going to aim for family-friendly fun you need to get the fun part right." �� P.T.

The world of the 1950s is a somber swirl of cigarette smoke and dark shadows where people speak in whispered riddles drink martinis and drive around in hulking automobiles.

Mr. Morris one of the great sleuths of modern cinema (who many years ago worked as a private detective) brings to ���Wormwood�� a long acquaintance with the slipperiness of truth and the deceptions of power.

Often grizzled comic relief though sometimes tragic these sidemen stand in the long tall shadow of the hero giving him grief while always following his lead. They��re loyal dogs surrogate nannies maybe close pals. They��re types that need more to carry a movie than Mr. Mosh� has given Lefty." Stumpy in ���Rio Bravo �� Lefty has a noticeable limp and the pitch of his voice periodically slides to lightly comedic heights. (You can hear a bit of Slim Pickens��s warble too.) At times Lefty seems like the sum of his inspirations which remains true even as the film progresses and settles into its groove. Central to the movie��s modest pleasures is how it engages with screen history; at the same time as the too familiar story of good men and bad loyalty and betrayal emerges these allusions can remind you that you��re not watching Howard Hawks. Instead Jim Caviezel and Tommy Flanagan ride up and the plot continues to thicken amid firing guns." his good looks obscured by chiaroscuro shadows and mutton chops keeps you tethered to Lefty even when the rambling turns to drift. Mr. Mosh� knows his genre. There��s beauty in his panoramas and charm in his reflexive gestures typified by Jeremiah��s love for the mythic heroism that foreshadows his and Lefty��s future. Yet self-consciousness is also a hallmark of this genre; Douglas Fairbanks��s would-be cowboy reads dime novels in the 1917 film ���Wild and Woolly.�� Even so while Mr. Mosh���s ambitions can be frustratingly modest he does know that ��� however fraudulent the genre��s myths ��� the image of a man riding a horse into the sunset is in our cinematic DNA." the likable easygoing western ���The Ballad of Lefty Brown�� tips its battered cowboy hat to its genre influences. John Wayne delivers that same admonition in ���Rio Bravo �� Howard Hawks��s 1959 masterpiece about a sheriff and a ragtag group holding off a powerful autocratic rancher. (Wayne��s sheriff is chiding his alcoholic deputy played by Dean Martin.) In large and small ways that film and other classics from the western canon inform ���Lefty Brown �� which opens one dark stormy night in the Montana territory in 1889 the year it became the 41st state." though a villain fatally derails Edward��s plans spurring the story forward and igniting its slow-burning mystery. Laura accuses Edward��s longtime hand Lefty (Bill Pullman) of failing her husband. (���You were supposed to watch his back �� a grieving Laura tells an apologetic equally bereft Lefty. ���Sorry don��t get it done.��) Lefty sets off to find Edward��s killer a quest that becomes a journey and leads him straight into trouble. He soon meets an inexpert traveler Jeremiah (Diego Josef) who has killed his own horse. All Jeremiah knows of the West are the romantic myths that he has learned from tattered dime novels some of which feature fictionalized tales right out of Lefty��s past."

yet the movie cuts loose when he does as when he embraces the galaxy��s strangeness its non-humanoid beings as well as its magic and mystery. There��s a trippy scene in which a character floats into a resurrection an ethereal drift that borders on the surreal. It��s a fleeting bliss-out in a series that knows how to bring the weird but has too often neglected to do so amid its blaster zapping machinations and Oedipal stressing and storming. This is after all a franchise in which the most indelible character remains Yoda the wee far-out philosophizer with the tufted pate and syntactically distinct truth telling: ���Wars not make one great.��" �� ���The Last Jedi�� engages with the first ���Star Wars�� movie less as a fetish than as a necessary point of departure. And like Alec Guinness��s Obi-Wan Kenobi once did Luke comes off as a brooding monastic loner. With a hooded robe beard and inexplicable moodiness he has retreated to an eerily lovely isolated island where imaginatively designed critters roam and trill. The cutest (right in time for Christmas tie-ins) are Porgs saucer-eyed mewling creatures with plump puffin-like bodies that are mainly on hand for easy laughs. The creature design throughout is so inventive ��� there are less-fuzzy whatsits on the island too ��� that you wish more had been added." the principals were in place as was an overarching mythology that during some arid periods has seemed more sustained by fan faith than anything else. Even so he has to convince you that these searching burgeoning heroes and villains fit together emotionally not simply on a Lucasfilm whiteboard and that they have the requisite lightness and heaviness the ineffable spirit and grandeur to reinvigorate a pop-cultural juggernaut. That he��s made a good movie in doing so isn��t icing; it��s the whole cake." which charts the franchise��s future while continuing to pass the baton from its first holy trinity ��� Carrie Fisher Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill ��� to a new trio introduced in ���The Force Awakens.�� Mr. Ford��s character Han Solo exited the series in that movie. As Leia Ms. Fisher plays a critical role in this new one but her death last December (after production ended) imparts real melancholy to a series that from its start has been defined ��� if not always comfortably ��� by loss." once upon a time yet again peace remains elusive and weapons are locked loaded and often firing. Here the fight continues with Leia searching for her absent brother Luke Skywalker (Mr. Hamill) while leading the Resistance against the First Order the dark-side successor to the dictatorial Empire (Darth Vader��s cohort). The old Imperial evildoers have been replaced by the suitably cartoonish-sounding Snoke (created by the hard-working Andy Serkis and digital effects) a wormy towering ghoul with vivid scars and an insinuating sneer. He commands the usual stormtroopers along with the impetuous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a charismatic villain who has closely fashioned himself after Vader." �� the leadoff of the series�� newest trilogy. Keeping track of where each ���Star Wars�� title fits into the overall scheme of things can be brain-numbing (the movies weren��t made in story-chronological order) but the strongest ones work as stand-alones and let you just go with the onscreen flow. The writer-director of ���The Last Jedi �� Rian Johnson frontloads the critical back story intel ��� who��s fighting who and the like ��� in the opening crawl. And then he gets down to the difficult business of putting his fingerprints on a franchise that deliberately resists individual authorship." visual flair (not simply bleeding-edge special effects) to the design and narrative savvy to Rey and Kylo Ren��s relationship. Mr. Johnson��s use of deep red is characteristic of how he turns ideas into images most vividly with a set that looks like something Vincente Minnelli might have dreamed up for a Flash Gordon musical with Gene Kelly. When that set becomes the backdrop to a viscerally exciting fight all the red abruptly evokes the spilled blood that this otherwise squeaky clean series insistently elides." J.J. Abrams (���The Force Awakens��) and Mr. Johnson are technically adept commercially savvy ���Star Wars�� true believers who came of age in the post-Lucas blockbuster era. Each has had to navigate the intricacies of Mr. Lucas��s sprawling fiction while handling the deep imprint created by Darth Vader��s heavy-breathing menace R2-D2��s amusing beeps Mr. Ford��s insouciance Mr. Hamill��s earnestness and Ms. Fisher��s smarts and latter-day screwball charm. Unlike Mr. Lucas though Mr. Abrams and Mr. Johnson don��t feel burdened by that legacy; they��re into it charged up despite the pressures of such an industrial enterprise. They��re resolving their cinematic father issues with a sense of fun." �� this inclusion feels natural a vision of the future you can recognize. About the only time it feels as if Mr. Johnson is checking ���Star Wars�� boxes is in some of the fights especially during an impasse that turns into a slow-moving game of space chess. He may be checking off some of those boxes in an ode to George Lucas; whatever the case Mr. Johnson only infrequently comes across as dutiful or as overtly brand-expanding (as with a troika of calculatingly cute tykes who unnervingly suggest this series really will go on forever)." but its complications are mitigated by Mr. Johnson��s quick pace and the appealing performers. Like most contemporary action flicks this one more or less plays out as a succession of fights chases and time outs (for chatting scheming or lonely musing) across two or more plot lines. Having joined together in ���The Force Awakens �� the story��s latest dream team ��� Rey (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger turned warrior; Finn (John Boyega) a First Order deserter turned resister; and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) a Resistance fighter pilot ��� now often spends time apart. Poe spins in Leia��s orbit while Rey pesters Luke and Finn finds a winning ally (Kelly Marie Tran)." hooky effects old-school heroics and loads of marketable material that helped turn fan love into an ecumenical cult. The second trilogy entirely directed by Mr. Lucas began in 1999 with ���The Phantom Menace�� (infamous for the minor scandal called Jar Jar Binks) and is pretty much a drag outside of some fleet light-saber duels and the arresting black-and-red patterning that distinguishes one villain." multi-everything group whose leaders include a battle-tested woman warrior ��� has been fighting the good fight for years but is outnumbered and occasionally outmaneuvered. Yes the latest ���Star Wars�� installment is here and lo it is a satisfying at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably it has visual wit and a human touch no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever)." however make warehouses of money as this franchise has been affirming for decades. It��s instructive how normalized its permanent war has become with its high body count bloodlessness and fascist chic (the black uniforms evoking the Nazi SS). Given this it��s notable too that while Mr. Johnson manages the big-canvas battles well enough he��s better with smaller-scaled fights in which the sweat vulnerabilities and personal costs of violence are foregrounded. With Mr. Driver ��� who delivers a startlingly raw performance ��� Mr. Johnson delivers a potent portrait of villainy that suggests evil isn��t hard-wired an inheritance or even enigmatic. Here it is a choice ��� an act of self-creation in the service of annihilation."

And there is Jorj whose younger brother Maksim clings to him who sulks when he��s told he needs to take off his outdoor shoes for gym and who struggles with math." but it��s worth remembering that the movie was made before the far-right politician Geert Wilders fell short of gaining the seats his party sought in the 2017 Dutch election. Nor is the movie��s message limited to Holland. At Film Forum ���Miss Kiet��s Children�� will screen with a Norwegian short that is animated in a style that suggests Jacob Lawrence and is drawn from interviews with children from Ivory Coast." the relative absence of conflict in the interactions between a seasoned teacher and wonderful pupils grows tedious at feature length and there is ��� presumably by design ��� relatively little meat on this documentary��s bones. We learn nothing about how the school runs or why it��s a locus for refugees. The film includes only incidental tidbits about the students�� lives outside the classroom or before their arrival in the Netherlands although in a charged moment late in the film Miss Kiet asks Jorj about his life in Syria where he played football inside the house to avoid what he calls the ���bang bang�� outside." a teacher introduced as she methodically sets up her classroom for another day. What separates her class from those in other Dutch villages is that her students are migrant children many of them Syrian. So in addition to the usual curriculum of reading writing and arithmetic Miss Kiet gently but determinedly instructs them in the hard work of assimilation teaching them in Dutch and encouraging them to play with Dutch children."

(The movie is Israel��s Oscar entry in the foreign-language category.) Meaning surfaces slowly here in details flashes of cruelty glimmers of apathy and a mounting sense of helplessness. First though there are parental tears and Dafna and Michael��s handsome sparsely furnished apartment with its tidy bookshelves and modernist furniture. The biggest room where Michael lingers while watching Dafna collapse has a geometrically patterned floor and is so large and precisely arranged that it suggests a showroom.

Her son Jonathan (Yonatan Shiray) who��s in the army has been killed. In a whir of motion and fatigue green they stoop over Dafna soothing and sedating her then tucking her in bed. Her husband Michael (a fantastic Lior Ashkenazi) mutely stares at this scene as if he were a bystander in his own life." Michael initially suffers and mourns alone. His red eyes watering yet not quite spilling over he understandably seems to be in shock. The soldiers have tended to him too fussing and hovering over him; in one shot he looks up at them as if he were a child. His brother (Yehuda Almagor) comes by and begins busily arranging a memorial notice. Two women rush in as well including Michael and Dafna��s daughter (Shira Haas). Everyone plays his or her part. The soldiers re-enter and one comfortably settles into a chair and rather too blithely proposes funeral arrangements to Michael sketching in every detail with the fastidious attention of a wedding planner." much of the movie��s first section unfolds inside the apartment. It��s a cloistered space made more confining by the tight close-ups of Michael��s face (Mr. Ashkenazi makes mourning palpable in each twitch) his ponderous near-somnolent movements and several overhead shots of him. These dramatically isolate him in the frame while creating an ambiguous narratively untethered point of view as if we were peering at him from a catwalk. Filmmakers call this a God��s-eye view." the checkpoint with its wide-open vistas provides relief. For a moment if seems as if you can breathe. The soldiers are cute amusing and very young. They��ve settled into dull monotonous work ��� raising the barrier for a camel ��� that can seem absurd. (What could go wrong?) But they also dance draw listen to music tell stories and entertain one another. The looseness and humor of their interactions are welcome but there are also new shivers of unease: The soldiers bunk in what looks like a repurposed derelict shipping container. Everything is falling apart decaying and the container is rapidly sinking into the mud." a near-miracle has occurred. Jonathan turns out to be alive and after his parents process the news the story shifts to him. He��s in a remote outpost fulfilling the compulsory military service demanded of most Israelis when they turn 18. Along with three other young men Jonathan guards a checkpoint lowering and raising a barrier for the occasional passing car or slow-loping camel. At night the soldiers train a harsh spotlight on passers-by and check IDs.

���I Tonya�� charts the hard-won rise and calamitous fall of its title character (Margot Robbie). Taking the form of a mock mocking documentary one that disjointedly swings between heehaw comedy and wincing agony the movie establishes its raised-eyebrow tone with a title card stating it��s ���Based on irony-free wildly contradictory and totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly �� her former husband. (The screenwriter Steven Rogers has said that he spoke with both.) From their separate corners the middle-aged long-divorced Tonya and Jeff (Sebastian Stan) provide linked at times vividly contradictory accounts of what happened." Tonya �� she is also an unreliable narrator just like Jeff. ���There��s no such thing as truth �� Tonya announces. ���Everyone has their own truth.�� The film takes up this statement as its guiding narrative principle toggling between the she-said and he-said as it hurdles toward its nadir. The older Tonya makes an assertion and the older Jeff does likewise. The young Tonya ��� in flashback ��� says one thing the young Jeff says something else and every so often LaVona chimes in. Characters periodically break the fourth wall by looking into the camera and directly addressing the viewer as if to assert ownership on the unwinding story. Listen to me each seems to say in these moments." Tonya�� skips here and there and thickens the plot it becomes increasingly baffling why the filmmakers decided to put a comic spin on this pathetic dispiriting story. No matter how hard the movie tries to coax out laughs there��s little about Ms. Harding her circumstances or her choices that skews as funny. She was poor grew up in trailers had a temper liked loud colors dropped out of school traded in one abuser for another and maintained some stupid acquaintances ��� a clown posse the filmmakers lavish too much time on. She might have played a role in the attack on Ms. Kerrigan but in many ways Ms. Harding had already been found guilty for just being who she was. The same feels true here." her past her abuse and her triumphs come into view. The only daughter of an unhappily married couple the young Tonya is a daddy��s girl. Her father takes her hunting teaching her how to shoot rabbit. Her awful mother LaVona (Allison Janney chilled and excellent) is the one who arranges for Tonya to take lessons with a skating coach (Julianne Nicholson). Tonya turns out to be a prodigy and is soon powering her way into the top echelon of the sport despite the snobbery and visible discomfort of the judges who favor froufrou femininity over aggressive competition. They want gliding princesses not grunting athletes like Tonya." documentaries and a quickie made-for-TV movie that lathered the soap. Before and after the incident as it��s often called she was grist for thumb-sucking takes on women femininity sports and social class. Before the attack writers liked to point out that Ms. Harding played pool and drove a truck. In a sympathetic 1992 profile Sports Illustrated described her as a ���hardscrabble dispossessed kid�� who had become ���an interloper in the realm of pixies and queens who��s as at home doing a brake job as she is performing an arabesque.�� She was Cinderella with edge and muscles." after she was implicated in an attack on Nancy Kerrigan a rival. On Jan. 6 after practicing for the United States Figure Skating Championships in Detroit Ms. Kerrigan was attacked by a man who thwacked her leg with a collapsible police baton. (He seems to have been going for her knee.) A camera captured Ms. Kerrigan on the ground as she repeatedly wailed ���Why?�� Ms. Harding went on to win the championship; it was a short-lived victory. The F.B.I. was soon questioning her her ex-husband and their dumb-and-dumber associates. By June Ms. Harding had been barred from competing for her role in the attack." giving an outsize performance that suits the film��s broadness and showy surfaces. (She does much of her own skating though the trickier moves were completed with stunt doubles and digital effects.) Despite the makeup and a few tragic haircuts Ms. Robbie remains an unpersuasive fit for the tiny Ms. Harding who could bench press more than her weight and whose sculptured muscles freaked some out. You could write a treatise on female bodies pegged to the contempt that journalists unloaded on her especially after the attack when they called her ���white trash�� and ���old Thunder Thighs.�� She was 23." Tonya�� ��� a winking eager-to-please fictionalized gloss on the disgraced ice skater Tonya Harding ��� gets roughed up a lot. As a child she is degraded and smacked around by her mother who kicks little Tonya��s chair so violently the kid flies off it. When the teenage Tonya gets involved with the man she will marry her life as a punching bag continues. Her husband smashes her head onto a glass surface so hard that shards scatter; he bloodies her nose a few times. He also points a gun at Tonya threatening to kill her. Despite all the beatings and blood ���I Tonya�� insists it��s a comedy." Tonya�� asserts that the truth is elusive. Yet some facts are known. Ms. Harding ��� as was widely reported ��� took out restraining orders against Mr. Gillooly telling the police that he had hit her and she was afraid of him. Back then her abuse was often played down; here it is countered by scenes in which the tough Tonya fights back at times with a comedic spin as if to suggest that she can give as good as she gets. That makes this film and the brutality more breezily watchable I suppose. Still it��s instructive that at one point Tonya lectures the audience on its complicity in how she was treated. It��s an impressively disingenuous wag of the finger from a film that has encouraged our laughter right from the start." Jeff sits facing the camera in front of a large window framed by photo-covered walls. There��s a lot more visual coding going on with Tonya who��s plunked down at a table in a modest kitchen wearing a pale jeans jacket and cowboy boots. Lank blond hair and bangs border her face; her neck has gone puffy. Looking into the camera she occasionally draws on a cigarette and crosses her legs one big down-home country-gal ankle resting on a knee. The real eye-catchers are the dirty dishes stacked in the sink behind her. They stay put and stay dirty which seems curiously sloppy given that Tonya a media veteran is here to tell her truth. If you didn��t know she had a reputation as down-and-dirty here��s a hint."

Early on in  ���Bill Frisell: A Portrait �� Mr. Frisell a quiet diffident man tells an off-camera interviewer that when he gets up in the morning he picks up a guitar starts playing ���and then ��_�� he drifts off. The suggestion is that he never stops." however don��t always make entirely compelling cinema. A cab ride through London with Mr. Frisell��s former teacher the composer and conductor Michael Gibbs is frankly a little drowsy. Once the duo who are working on a collaborative concert reach their destination a radio station they are directed to a studio called ���the Barbarella Room.��" Mr. Frisell recalls what he remembers as ���the only illegal thing�� he has ever done: as a 15-year-old gaining entry to a theatrical screening of ���Barbarella �� the very tame sex-in-outer-space ��60s film starring Jane Fonda when the movie was restricted to viewers over 16. Which is funny." there are several points in this movie ��� which I��m still recommending ��� that I found if not boring a little dry. In a sense Mr. Frisell 66 is an entirely atypical contemporary musician. As the impresario and record producer Hal Willner notes early in the documentary despite Mr. Frisell��s having performed or recorded with literally hundreds of other top-flight players and troubadours ���there��s no one who has a bad word to say about him.�� Being a ���no drama�� person is lovely and it��s particularly salutary that Mr. Frisell upends the myth that the great artist needs to be full of anger or to behave badly to be inspired."

partly a genetically modified monster movie and altogether wonderful. Guillermo del Toro the writer and director is a passionate genre geek. Sometimes his enthusiasm can get the better of his discipline producing misshapen (but never completely uninteresting) movies like ���Pacific Rim�� and ���Crimson Peak.�� At his best though ��� in ���The Devil��s Backbone �� ���Pan��s Labyrinth�� and now at last again ��� he fuses a fan��s ardor with a romantic sensibility that is startling in its sincerity. He draws on old movies comic books mythic archetypes and his own restless visual imagination to create movies that seem less made than discovered as if he had plucked them from the cultural ether and given them color voice and form." though he has dabbled in large-scale franchise-ready filmmaking has never succumbed to the authoritarian aesthetic of the Hollywood blockbuster. He is a reflexive democrat whose underdog sympathies haven��t curdled into glum superhero self-pity. The most welcome and notable thing about ���The Shape of Water�� is its generosity of spirit which extends beyond the central couple. Zelda and Giles an artist whose advertising career has been derailed are not just supporting players. They have miniature movies of their own as does Mr. Stuhlbarg��s scientist-cum-spook. And so for that matter does Strickland though it isn��t a movie anyone else would want to be in not least because it feels the closest to reality." soulful and gorgeous beneath his shimmering carapace of blue-green scales supply most of those. Since neither Elisa nor the Asset possesses the power of speech they communicate through gestures and since both can hear through music. Ms. Hawkins giving a silent performance in a sound film will perhaps inevitably evoke Charlie Chaplin and she moves her body and her facial features with Chaplinesque elegance narrowing the distance between acting and dancing turning physical comedy into corporeal poetry." basically ��� and also at how natural how un-creepy how pure and right he makes it seem. And why not? Folklore is full of frog princes beauties and beasts. Classical mythology has its satyrs and centaurs its shape-shifting gods and metamorphosing nymphs whose commingling and canoodling is part of the human heritage." �� a Cold War-era camp-horror classic about a strange beast quasi-fish and sort-of human discovered in the rain forests of the Amazon. In Mr. del Toro��s update such a creature is brought to Baltimore in the early 1960s and kept in a tank at a government research lab where he is subjected to brutal torture in the name of science and national security." but kindness is always possible and so is beauty. ���The Shape of Water�� is made of vivid colors and deep shadows; it��s as gaudy as a musical (and briefly turns into one) bright as a cartoon and murky as a film noir. (The cinematographer is Dan Laustsen. The score is by Alexandre Desplat.) Its busy plot moves swiftly ��� the presence of Russian spies never hurts especially when one is played by Michael Stuhlbarg ��� except when Mr. del Toro lingers over a moment of tenderness a delicate joke or an eruption of grace." though reality is the domain of rules and responsibilities and realism is a crabbed literal-minded view of things that can be opposed only by the forces of imagination. This will never be a fair or symmetrical fight and the most important reason to make movies like this one ��� or for that matter to watch them ��� is to even the odds." �� as his minders call him poses no threat to anyone. He is as wild things tend to be in movies nowadays an innocent at the mercy of a ruthlessly predatory species which is to say us. His particular nemesis is Richard Strickland a government-issue square-jawed square played with reliable menace by Michael Shannon. Strickland lives in a suburban split-level with his wife and two kids drives a Cadillac reads ���The Power of Positive Thinking�� and is into mechanical missionary sex (and workplace sexual harassment). His favorite accessory is an electric cattle prod a detail that links him to the Southern sheriffs occasionally shown terrorizing civil rights demonstrators on television." she is looked at by others ��� and sometimes regards herself ��� as ���incomplete �� something less than fully human. Her two best friends are Zelda (Octavia Spencer) an African-American woman who works with her and Giles (Richard Jenkins) a gay man who lives next door. The understated intuitive sympathy among these outcasts gives this fable some political bite." and in his diabolical all-American normalcy a necessary foil for the film��s loose rebel coalition a band of misfits who come to the Asset��s defense. The most important of these is Elisa (Sally Hawkins) a member of the laboratory��s nighttime cleaning staff who plays jazz records for the piscine captive feeds him hard-boiled eggs and before long falls in love with him."

A tone of fraught pessimism accumulates swelling into sociopolitical allegory as in the background the country��s deteriorating relationship with Ukraine plays out on the evening news and journalists are vilified for inciting end-of-days hysteria. It��s a grimly cynical view of modern Russia that��s inarguably blunt (especially in an extended shot of Zhenya running on a treadmill to nowhere the word ���Russia�� emblazoned on her sweatsuit) but no less chilling for that." ���Loveless�� (a title distilled in a single image of a child��s violated unclaimed corpse) earns its air of careful foreboding.

Set in Moscow in the autumn of 2012 the picture sits on the screen with an almost physical weight its heaviness as much to do with the bleakly beautiful visuals and painstaking pacing as the bitter divorce at its center.

a republic of misfits and oddballs among whom solidarity is automatic. The deadpan style of the acting functions as a vaccine against sentimentality but there is no doubting the sincerity of this movie��s motives or the effectiveness of its methods." subtle joke one of many in ���The Other Side of Hope �� the Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki��s humane and gravely funny new film. The national temperament at least as Mr. Kaurismaki sketches it is decidedly saturnine. Smiles are as rare as trips to the gym or the plastic surgeon. Finland is a country of weary stoical sad sacks with sagging faces who sit behind desks eat bland food and play in rockabilly bands. Maybe Mazdak is right and the government hopes that admitting upbeat migrants will provide a needed infusion of joy." �� ���Juha�� and ���Leningrad Cowboys Go America��) will instantly recognize the hallmarks of his style. Those new to the filmmaker may need a few scenes to adjust to the look feel and rhythm of his world. His approach is old-fashioned. ���The Other Side of Hope�� has the stately pace and graceful precision of a movie from the 1930s and democratic anti-authoritarian politics that also evoke that era. This is less a matter of nostalgia than of aesthetic commitment. You could list filmmakers from the past ��� Victor Sjostrom Frank Borzage and Jean Vigo for example ��� among Mr. Kaurismaki��s influences but it would be more accurate to describe them as his contemporaries." fleeing civil war in Syria has wound up in Helsinki where he lives in a dormitory with other refugees. One Mazdak who is from Iraq coaches Khaled (Sherwan Haji) before his asylum hearing. Mazdak (Simon Hussein Al-Bazoon) tells his friend to be cheerful since the Finns will deport ���melancholics.��" played by Sakari Kuosmanen a familiar face in the Kaurismaki cosmos.

Khaled joins the restaurant staff which includes a dubiously competent chef (Janne Hyytiainen) a bored-looking waitress (Nuppu Koivu) and a spectral ma�tre d�� (Ilkka Koivula)." ���The Other Side of Hope�� might have been cited as an example of realism by virtue of its subject matter. It addresses an urgent social problem ��� the European refugee crisis ��� and sets its story among what used to be called the common people. But Mr. Kaurismaki does not traffic in the harsh immersive naturalism that has recently flourished on the international festival circuit and his movies feel more like fables than like bulletins." a fixture of world cinema returning to form after a period of relative inactivity ��� ���Other Side�� is his first feature since 2011 and only his fourth in this century ��� is a profoundly patriotic filmmaker. He is less a satirical observer of his nation��s foibles than an excavator of its mopey mordant steadfast conscience. Helsinki as Khaled experiences it has its dangers. He is menaced by racist skinheads and thwarted by literal-minded bureaucrats. Yet he also encounters the unsentimental occasionally grudging kindness of ordinary Finns and when he tells Mazdak that he has fallen in love with his new home you can understand why." it��s at once honest and artful a touching and clearsighted declaration of faith in people and in movies."

���The Disaster Artist�� is a straighter more obviously commercial-minded project than some of the other movies that Mr. Franco has directed. It��s a divertingly funny movie but its breeziness can also feel overstated at times glib and a bit of a dodge. In ���The Room �� Mr. Wiseau comes across as somewhat menacing with an underlying intensity that can��t be entirely laughed away. (That��s part of what makes the unwatchable almost watchable.) Mr. Franco��s performance keeps you hooked in large degree because of its entertaining visual spectacle. Tommy��s wardrobe for one suggests a commitment to the 1980s and a familiarity with the defunct catalog International Male a source for padded briefs and Jack Sparrow frippery." the ha-ha comedy ���The Disaster Artist�� involves one of the favorite topics of the movies: itself. It��s another story of crushed Hollywood dreams one that unfolds through the eyes of Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) an aspiring actor who hitched himself to a phenomenon when he met Tommy Wiseau (James Franco Dave��s brother). A would-be auteur the real Mr. Wiseau became a minor cult figure after he released a 2003 specialty item ���The Room �� that some anointed the worst movie ever made. In time its notoriety started to pay off; in 2013 Mr. Sestero wrote a tell-all book." which have already been generously extended by ���The Disaster Artist.�� His website for ���The Room�� suggests that he��s a busy man. It lists where and how you can see the film sometimes with him in attendance. In the synergistic spirit of Disney (but with lavish misspellings) the website also features a line of tie-in products like ���Room��-themed watches backpacks jackets and men��s briefs emblazoned with Mr. Wiseau��s name on the waistband. It��s funny and somewhat depressing which also pretty much sums up the ���The Room �� one of those cultish attractions that is so terrible it makes you wonder if the laugh finally is on us." he proves to be not an especially interesting one in this incarnation. The filmmakers try to complicate Tommy including with some self-referential layering that never meaningfully develops. At one point early on Greg and Tommy visit the site where James Dean died a pilgrimage that at once nods to Mr. Franco��s breakthrough role as Dean and telegraphs one of the more ludicrous scenes in ���The Room.�� Dean becomes Greg and Tommy��s inspiration a success story that they invoke while struggling to make it. But there��s no sense that either remotely grasps Dean��s art which might have made their failure and ���The Disaster Artist�� more resonant." inexplicable friendship begins and before long Greg and Tommy are driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles where much of the story takes place. Shacked up in Tommy��s apartment the two men try and fail to break into the entertainment business though Greg manages to sign with a talent agency. Hope fades as it does amid the sunshine and smiles and this movie slips into idle. Tommy continues to prove his lack of talent in a very funny and terrible audition; Greg finds romance with a bartender Amber (Alison Brie). At last inspired by Greg Tommy ��� who has mysteriously deep pockets that never seem to empty ��� decides to direct and star in his own movie with Greg as backup. It��s a personal vision that eventually spirals into a mutual hallucination." ���The Disaster Artist�� recounts both the making of a friendship and the absurdly inept movie it produced. Greg meets Tommy in acting class where they��re both bombing out. Greg comes off as simply incompetent as he flatly fumbles through a scene from ���Waiting for Godot �� one of the movie��s first jokey meta-moments. (���Let us do something while we have the chance! �� Vladimir exclaims in ���Godot �� much as Tommy soon urges Greg.) Tommy by vivid contrast captivates the agape class ��� particularly the inhibited Greg ��� by turning up the volume on Stanley Kowalski while thrashing about as if demonically possessed." who also directed ���The Disaster Artist �� swoops through the movie like a star one who has no idea that he never achieved liftoff. His face framed by a dramatic curtain of inky black hair and noticeably if discreetly modified by prosthetics Mr. Franco certainly looks the part and sounds it too having perfectly captured Mr. Wiseau��s puzzling accent and arrhythmic intonation. Yet even at its most convincing Mr. Franco��s performance retains an interior lightness a playfulness including when Tommy goes emotionally dark. Mr. Franco isn��t making fun of his character at least not entirely; rather he��s put distance into the mix as if to point out that Tommy is very much a self-made man a construction." and Mr. Franco is no exception. (He mined similarly reflexive terrain in the very dissimilar ���Interior. Leather Bar. �� an experimental feature that he directed with Travis Mathews about the making and remaking of ���Cruising.��) Mr. Franco recreates the production of ���The Room�� ��� and the escalating behind-the-scenes nuttiness ��� with an assured energetic touch some fitting burlesque and an appealing cast that includes Jacki Weaver and Seth Rogen who gives his deadpan a workout to play Tommy��s put-upon script supervisor."

The movie is narrated by Mickey who pops in and out and looks directly into the camera. He has literary ambitions as he likes to remind us as well as a pad in Greenwich Village. For a while Mickey offers Ginny a respite from her everyday grind at least until the arrival of Carolina (a fine Juno Temple) Humpty��s daughter from an earlier marriage. She��s on the run from her gangster husband. ���I know where all the bodies are buried �� Carolina says." despite the insistently unflattering way she is often presented. She winces and frowns a lot and the camera conspires with the lighting and makeup to catch every twitch of distress and the sweaty oily sheen she never seems able to blot away. It��s no surprise that she��s worried. She works in a clam house on the boardwalk scrambling for hoi polloi while back at home she has to juggle her loud loutish husband Humpty (Jim Belushi) and her son Richie (Jack Gore).

But while Alvy is depressed about the universe Richie seems largely troubled by his home life specifically his demonstrably miserable mother." Mr. Allen has often folded bits and pieces ��� and at times entire conceits ��� from other work into his movies. Mickey mentions Eugene O��Neill a reference that suggests we��re meant to see something of that playwright in Ginny and Humpty at their most raw and boozily fraught. Mr. Allen��s often blunt overwrought dialogue however also alternately brings to mind Budd Schulberg (���I coulda been a contender��) and imitation Clifford Odets. In some scenes you almost expect Mr. Belushi who��s playing his heart out to start bellowing about someone named Lefty.

As has always been the case with his movies the actors seem to have delivered the performances they came to the set with so the strong ��� in this case the invaluable Ms. Winslet ��� are strong while the rest of the cast members do what they can with varying degrees of success.

But Ms. Winslet fills this shabby character with feverish life. She conveys far more with a single quietly stunned look than any of Mr. Allen��s speeches or Mr. Storaro��s color changes." who seems to have enjoyed taking the color wheel and camera out for a spin. He gives the story visual flow even when the characters are in claustrophobic lockdown. And Mr. Storaro keeps your pupils dancing with the light and dark hues. Some of the establishing shots of Coney Island recall the softer side of Technicolor whereas the violently saturated scenes suggest the vibrancy of the Blue Rider palette. The more extreme colors ��� including an unlovely orange light that floods Ginny ��� pushes the whole thing into expressionism even as the movie fluctuates between kitchen-sink realism and hothouse melodrama." after Ginny has turned into Blanche DuBois she announces ���When it comes to love we often turn out to be our own worst enemy.�� And not for the first time you wonder what Mr. Allen who has long blurred fact and fiction thinks he��s doing here. He couldn��t have anticipated that his name would be in the news because of the allegations of sexual abuse upending the entertainment industry. Yet how could we not think of him? In 1993 he was accused of molesting his daughter Dylan Farrow. He maintained his innocence and was never prosecuted yet the allegations as well as discomfort about his marriage to Soon-Yi have hovered over him like a malignant cloud. Critics have often uneasily ignored his history but he himself seems perversely intent on invoking it." the childhood home of his alter ego Alvy Singer the narrator of ���Annie Hall�� who claims to have grown up under the amusement park��s roller coaster. (���I have some trouble between fantasy and reality �� Alvy says.) In ���Wonder Wheel �� the sad wife Ginny (Kate Winslet) lives in an apartment that looks directly onto the park��s looming Ferris wheel. The attraction obscures her view of the ocean literalizing already narrow horizons and casts deep expressionistic blue and red light on the apartment��s dilapidated interior and its equally worn inhabitants." �� Woody Allen��s latest movie is one of his more unfortunate contributions to cinema. It tells the story of a desperately unhappily married woman whose affair with a local Romeo is derailed when he takes notice of her stepdaughter whose breasts have been lit to glow like Vermeer peaches. The heart wants what it wants as Mr. Allen once said by way of explaining his affair with his now wife Soon-Yi the daughter of his longtime ex Mia Farrow.

Ms. Di Giusto takes considerable liberties with the facts of Fuller��s life giving her an entirely fictional male patron whose decadent ether addiction is out of a bad ���Dorian Gray�� parody. (It��s not much of a role and Gaspard Ulliel who was very good in 2014��s ���Saint Laurent �� makes very little of it.) In Ms. Di Giusto��s vision Fuller is outshined by Isadora Duncan portrayed by Lily-Rose Depp as a shallow arriviste. Ms. Depp��s flat line readings are in this respect appropriate." Ms. Di Giusto mainly confines the action to a villa where Fuller endures sickness and a series of self-fulfilling romantic humiliations. She then watches as Duncan goes on to eclipse her. In commemorating the work of a female artist by largely refracting it through an imagined professional rivalry with another female artist ���The Dancer�� seems genuinely hostile to its subject whose real-life accomplishments deserve better."

�� the actress Hedy Lamarr once said. ���All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.�� It��s a withering observation especially for a Hollywood star once known as ���the most beautiful woman in the world.�� Beauty brought Lamarr fame at least until everything fell spectacularly apart; as with too many actresses beauty was also her gilded cage. The new documentary ���Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story�� shows how hard and how long she struggled to escape it ��� including through her invention in the 1940s of a groundbreaking communication system that underlies modern encryption." missed opportunities and heartbreak. She married again (and then four more times) and raised a few children one of whom she treated unspeakably. She also tinkered and she invented. At home Lamarr had what her biographer Richard Rhodes one of the movie��s on-camera experts describes as an inventing table. Howard Hughes gave her a small version of this setup Mr. Rhodes explains that was kept in the trailer she used while shooting films. Hughes also lent her a few of his chemists for one of her projects; for her part Lamarr counseled him on a plane design." the brilliance of her discovery was overshadowed by the spectacle of failure as her stardom gave way to forgettable roles misfires catastrophes and more scandal. ���Bombshell�� sympathetically tracks her downward spiral without reducing her to the sum of her misfortunes. That��s a relief and seems right given how tough and proud Lamarr can sound in the interviews. Back in 1942 in that breathless story about her invention Lamarr insisted that she hadn��t changed. ���I��ve always been as I am today �� she said. ���If I am a ���new Hedy�� as some say it is because they are seeing me as I really am not looking at the outside of me.�� History finally figured out that she was right." she was in her 70s and no longer of use to Hollywood. That part of her story is bleakly familiar; it��s a sad maddening movie-industry refrain especially for older actresses. Another hurdle as ���Bombshell�� makes clear is that a female performer who subverted expectations ��� who was smart and not just lovely ��� wasn��t welcome in the world. Some of the period coverage of Lamarr��s invention attests to this. ���It does seem incredible that anyone as beautiful and as fragile-looking as the luscious Hedy could be mechanically minded �� one 1942 magazine story trumpeted adding that ���she can sing has a flare for designing and interior decorating.��" those onscreen and off with savvy and narrative snap fluidly marshaling a mix of original interviews and archival material that includes film clips home movies and other footage. Ms. Dean��s most valuable resource though are Lamarr��s taped interviews with Fleming Meeks a journalist. In a 1990 Forbes article he helped refurbish her legend by recounting how some 50 years earlier Lamarr ��� who wanted to contribute to the war effort ��� created a communication system with her friend the composer George Antheil. What she was after was a radio-controlled torpedo that couldn��t be jammed. Her solution: randomly switched frequencies." Hedy Kiesler had been renamed Hedy Lamarr and she was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and starring alongside Charles Boyer in the romantic thriller ���Algiers.�� It was Boyer��s show; Lamarr was a side dish. In his review of the film the critic Otis Ferguson all but shrugged her off as ���the girl �� while movie magazine writers slobbered over her looks. ���No more beautiful woman �� one columnist gushed ���has ever stormed the doors of moviedom than Hedy grey-eyed raven-haired Viennese known as the ���Ecstasy Girl.���� Four years later Lamarr was still battling such typecasting blather despite having patented a secret communications system called frequency hopping." ���Bombshell�� is a very enjoyable addition to what has become a minor Hedy Lamarr industry that includes documentaries books and stage productions. Like some of these other accounts this documentary traces the arcs of Lamarr��s personal and professional lives which by turns harmoniously converged and wildly veered in opposite directions. Whatever happened it was rarely dull. The daughter of assimilated Jews she married a munitions magnate who came with a castle and did business with Mussolini. When she decided to ditch her husband she staged (or so she claimed) an escape that turned her into the heroine of her own thrilling adventure." ���Ecstasy and Me: My Life as a Woman �� which bizarrely includes an introduction by a shrink. (She unsuccessfully tried to stop its publication.) The title refers to the 1933 film that set her on the path toward scandal and stardom. Directed by Gustav Machaty ���Ecstasy�� involves a young woman��s sexual desire and disappointment and remains best known for the sight of its teenage Viennese star ��� then called Hedy Kiesler ��� frolicking naked and more notoriously feigning orgasm.

���Al Di Qua �� written and directed by Corrado Franco offers a narrative line of sorts as the cast members gather at a hospital to pay tribute to Rodolfo a dead comrade. In the strangest of many strange aesthetic decisions the voices have been slowed down to give the dialogue a baritone sound as if a combination of (mostly) black-and-white shooting a fragmented structure sporadic slow motion quotations from Rainer Maria Rilke Godardian title cards and absurdly gratuitous overlays of Bach weren��t portentous enough." too from Lionel Rogosin��s ���On the Bowery�� (1957) to the Fontainhas films of Pedro Costa ��� all movies about poverty that combine fiction and documentary elements." ���Al Di Qua�� casts the homeless of Turin as themselves (or close approximations).

The film seems pitched at an audience that has never heard of homelessness: Every shot is composed to evoke acknowledgment of the subjects�� dignity even while individual personalities are subsumed into the blur of Mr. Franco��s operatic ambitions.

the lyricism seduces as does fragile ecstatic Elio. ���Call Me by Your Name�� is less a coming-of-age story a tale of innocence and loss than one about coming into sensibility. In that way it is about the creation of a new man who the story suggests is liberated by pleasure that doesn��t necessarily establish sexual identity. It��s important that Elio and Oliver have relationships with women though for seemingly different reasons: the overheated Elio sleeps with a girlfriend (Esther Garrel) while Oliver carries on a more performative affair with a local (Victoire Du Bois). The women are not treated with much kindness but these affairs further complicate the movie��s vision of pleasure��s fluidity." intricate emotions that his actors put across so movingly. He can be discreet to the point of coyness (bodies sweat but don��t necessarily grunt) but it is finally the insistent delicacy and depth of emotion that makes these characters so heart-skippingly tender. The charismatic Mr. Chalamet Mr. Hammer and Mr. Stuhlbarg ��� whose brilliant delivery of a tricky speech pierces the heart and crucially the movie��s lustrous patina ��� transform beauty into feeling. In one alive vulnerable and life-altering summer Elio��s desire finds its purpose. He loves and in loving he becomes." civilized and perfectly if a shade too flawlessly arranged. Here even a busy breakfast table and the fruit on a tree can seem art directed. Mr. Guadagnino almost can��t help making everything look intoxicating yet he also makes you believe in this family��s reality. The grand piano isn��t for show and neither are the books or the open affection and respect with which Elio and his parents treat one another. (The movie reminds you how rarely characters read for pleasure much less listen to classical music.) ���Call Me by Your Name�� is set in 1983 so no one is staring into a smartphone. And the time frame means that AIDS doesn��t figure in the story though there��s a suggestion that the closet does." ���Call Me by Your Name�� progresses through evasions and encounters with Elio advancing Oliver receding and their circling narrowing. The two don��t (can��t won��t) always say what they mean. So Mr. Guadagnino speaks for them by eroticizing their world making desire visible in the luxuriousness of the setting in the green enveloping the villa the gushing waters of a pool and the graceful lines of male statues. When Oliver hungrily eats a soft-boiled egg cracking the shell and causing the yolk to messily spurt Mr. Guadagnino��s lyricism slides into comedy; it��s hard to know just how self-mocking the moment is meant to be." showing you what he sees his erotic reveries and yearning. And it��s Elio who initiates the affair at least overtly though Oliver later admits to playing his part in what the story frames as a mutual seduction. Mr. Guadagnino avoids directly engaging the difference in Elio and Oliver��s ages which might have forced him to explore the underside of his sumptuous surfaces to greater messier effect. Instead Mr. Guadagnino leans on beauty as when Elio��s father poetically speaks to an increasingly agitated Oliver about the ���ageless ambiguity�� of some male statues (���as if they��re daring you to desire them��)." with their sleepiness and bared limbs. Everyone seems to move in slow motion at the villa except perhaps the family��s hard-working maid. This languor fits the tempo of Elio and Oliver��s relationship which evolves over meals drowsy idylls a little work and a spontaneous piano recital that becomes an overture to seduction. A gifted musician Elio easily moves from piano to guitar (much as his family shifts from speaking Italian to French to English) talent that makes him seem at one with the villa��s miles of bookshelves its velvet sofas scattered Oriental rugs and tastefully arranged antiques." you swoon into them. His best-known titles ���I Am Love�� and ���A Bigger Splash �� feature beautiful people with impeccable taste experiencing haute-bourgeois life intensely. Passion and drama upend those lives but what��s most striking about these movies is their extraordinary palpable quality. In Mr. Guadagnino��s work passion and drama are expressed in words deeds and surging music but also in the vibrant visceral textures that envelop his characters ��� the cool marble succulent fruit shadow and light sheens of sweat. These are movies that turn your gaze into near-touch inviting you to see and almost caress their sun-warmed bodies." ���Call Me by Your Name �� is another ravishment of the senses though this time there��s a strong narrative tethering all the churning feelings and sensuous surfaces. Like the 2007 novel by Andr� Aciman on which it��s based the story turns on an affair between Elio Perlman (Timoth�e Chalamet) a coltish 17-year-old American-Italian and Oliver (Armie Hammer) an American in his 20s. Elio lives with his father (a tremendous Michael Stuhlbarg) and mother (Amira Casar) in a villa in northern Italy. Each summer the father a professor of Greco-Roman culture invites a student to work with him and stay with his family; this year it��s Oliver who moves in." conveying the kind of nonchalance that��s a shield for interest. Oliver proves far better at this part of the game; he knows more than to look too long and too hard. Elio��s furtive ducking glances by contrast tend to linger hovering in the air like questions. He��s increasingly curious about this new guest but soon inexplicably (to Elio at least) irked by him as well leading Elio to complain to his parents about Oliver��s standard signoff (���later��). But when Elio scribbles a private rebuke in a notebook chastising himself for responding harshly toward Oliver it��s as if he were writing an apologetic love letter."

sadder fellow than the version incarnated by Colin Firth in ���The King��s Speech.�� ���Darkest Hour �� a companion to ���Dunkirk �� is also in several senses a sequel to ���The King��s Speech �� a mildly enjoyed best picture winner. It is similarly a movie about the production of an important piece of rhetoric a ���mobilization of the English language�� in the service of a vital and righteous cause." ���Darkest Hour �� written by Anthony McCarten (���The Theory of Everything��) offers the public a few new insights and details about the practice of statecraft in a time of crisis. Churchill is disliked by many of his colleagues in the Conservative Party (notably Chamberlain and his vulpine sidekick Viscount Halifax) and distrusted by King George VI. The political situation is shaky the military reports dire. The new prime minister a man of large emotions and larger appetites who drinks whiskey with breakfast and is rarely without a cigar is plagued by frustration and doubt as he tries to navigate between two bad options. Will Britain enter into a ruinous war or submit to humiliating and most likely temporary peace on terms dictated by Hitler?" like the bravery of the soldiers airmen and ordinary Britons in ���Dunkirk �� is offered not as a rebuke to the current generation but rather as a sop an easy and complacent fantasy of Imperial gumption and national unity. Standing up to the Nazis an undeniably brave and good thing to have done is treated like a moral check that can be cashed in perpetuity. ���Darkest Hour�� is proud of its hero proud of itself and proud to have come down on the right side of history nearly 80 years after the fact. It wants you to share that pride and to claim a share of it. But we have nothing to be proud of." �� Mr. Wright��s film is a serviceable enough historical drama. But like ���Dunkirk �� it falls back on an idealized notion of the English character that feels in present circumstances less nostalgic than downright reactionary and as empty as those ubiquitous ���Keep Calm and Carry On�� internet memes. Rather than invite the audience to think about the difficulties of democratic governance at a time of peril the filmmakers promote passivity and hero-worship offering not so much a Great Man Theory as a great man fetish. Their sham populism is most evident in a ridiculous scene in which Churchill rides the London Underground and meets The People a motley mass of stiff upper lips and brimming eyes." German forces invaded Belgium and France and pushed most of the British army onto a beach in the French coastal town of Dunkirk. Neville Chamberlain the British prime minister best known (then and still) for his policy of appeasing Hitler was replaced by Winston Churchill whose first weeks as head of the government ��� culminating in the Dunkirk evacuation ��� are the subject of ���Darkest Hour �� Joe Wright��s new film. (The evacuation itself was reconstructed in Christopher Nolan��s ���Dunkirk �� released in July.)" desiccated aristo puddings played by Stephen Dillane and Ronald Pickup nobody makes much of an effort. Churchill is regarded with frank adoration by the camera and by the people the women in particular charged with the tasks of attending and indulging him. Kristin Scott Thomas is his wife Clementine Churchill a woman of brisk confidence and ironic disposition who long ago made peace with her secondary place in his public life. Lily James is his secretary Elizabeth Layton a clever and wide-eyed English rose who types Churchill��s correspondence and chastely buoys his morale at difficult moments." a helpful text before the final credits reminds us that Germany eventually lost the war.) Churchill himself is among the most revered and studied figures of 20th-century history: a synonym for leadership; a great man in an age of monsters; a source of pithy quotations some of which he actually said; an example to be cited by political mediocrities in need of an ego boost." of course an irresistible role for actors of every shape and size. (His American counterpart in this regard is not Franklin D. Roosevelt Churchill��s partner and peer but Lyndon B. Johnson who also possessed impressive jowls and a colorful way with words.) Gary Oldman aided by diligent makeup artists and propelled by his own unmatched craft and discipline embraces the task with almost palpable delight. The challenges facing Churchill are of lethal seriousness but the key to his effectiveness is his capacity for pleasure. He enjoys the push and pull of politics the intellectual labor of problem-solving and the daily adventure of being himself. In grasping that joy Mr. Oldman partakes of it and passes it along to the audience. He is having fun playing the part in every sense. And his blustery blubbery charm backed as it is by a sly and acute intelligence is hard to resist."

an application of the bright colors and open emotionalism of modern mainstream animation to an unlikely zone of experience. From the very start the studio has explored the inner lives of inanimate objects like lamps and toys with a tenderness we now take for granted. It has also summoned the post-human future (���Wall-E��) and the human unconscious (���Inside/Out��) with breathtaking ingenuity. And now it has set out to make a family-friendly cartoon about death." Miguel��s hometown where he is part of a prosperous clan of shoemakers. The cultural vibe of ���Coco�� is inclusive rather than exoticizing pre-empting inevitable concerns about authenticity and appropriation with the mixture of charm and sensitivity that has become something of a 21st-century Disney hallmark. Here the importance of family ��� the multigenerational household that sustains and constrains the hero ��� is both specific and universal. It��s what explains the particular beats of Miguel��s story and what connects him to viewers regardless of background." but the afterlife in ���Coco�� is a warm and hectic place more comical than creepy. The story takes place during the Day of the Dead when according to Mexican tradition (at least as interpreted by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina who directed the screenplay written by Mr. Molina and Matthew Aldrich) the border controls between life and death relax and the departed are allowed temporary passage to the land of the living. A young boy named Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) makes the trip in reverse which is not to say that he dies but rather that his living self through one of several metaphysical loopholes that the movie explains as it goes along is transported into a fantastical world of specters and skeletons who hold fabulous parties and raucous outdoor concerts." bold breakthrough like the computer-assisted rendering of fur in ���Monsters Inc. �� of water in ���Finding Nemo �� or of metal in ���Cars.�� The innovations in ���Coco�� are no less satisfying for being of a more subtle kind. The grain of leather and the rusted folds of corrugated metal have a rough almost tactile quality. Human bones hairless dogs and orange flower petals look uncannily (but not too uncannily) real. There are moments of cinematic rigor ��� when the animators mimic the movements and focal effects of an old-fashioned camera in actual physical space ��� that will warm any film-geek��s heart.

It��s reassuring rather than haunting which is a shrewd and successful commercial compromise but a compromise all the same." it plays a time-tested tune with captivating originality and flair and with roving playful pop-culture erudition. Miguel��s musical role model ��� and the source of the family embargo on musical expression ��� is a long-dead crooner and movie star named Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). In life and in death he incarnates venerable ideals of romance and wounded machismo or at least their show-business incarnations. (His greatest hits and movie clips form part of the texture of ���Coco �� the way the old ���Woody��s Roundup�� show did in the ���Toy Story�� movies.)" a ragged forgotten ghost who befriends Miguel. What links H�ctor with de la Cruz is a lurid story of passion betrayal and longing. Their lives and deaths are a ballad whose meaning and melody Miguel must learn. In doing so he will understand the thread that links him to both of them and also the sources of the anti-musical animus that runs so strongly in his maternal line." he is a bit like Remy the ���Ratatouille�� rat whose kin were hostile to his artistic ambition and like Mumble the misfit penguin in ���Happy Feet.�� Miguel��s genealogical quest ��� a search for roots lost ancestors and information that might explain who he is ��� resembles Dory��s journey in ���Finding Dory.�� The sidekicks who accompany him animal and (formerly) human are drawn from a familiar well of archetypes and the final round of lesson-learning and reconciliation hits notes we have heard many times before." who turns out to be the heart of the story. Her mother Imelda (Alanna No�l Ubach) is a furious matriarch on the other side of the grave while Coco��s daughter Miguel��s Abuelita (Ren�e Victor) is a no-nonsense flesh-and-blood autocrat.

No�l Wells Emily while mercurially talented has little idea where she��s going. Upon her Austin return she witnesses the rather Williams-Sonoma-inflected life her ex Eric (Nick Thune) has with a very tidy new partner Celeste (Britt Lower). This raises a welter of resentment in the far less genteel Emily." including a riff about the inherent sexism of the word ���quirky�� and one-liners like ���burritos are just sleeping bags for rice.�� The film fits comfortably into the lineage of movies like ���Tiny Furniture�� and ���Obvious Child �� about young women trying to make sense of their lives although it��s not quite distinctive enough to be considered outstanding in that company. (The repurposing of a gag I first saw in ���Meet the Parents �� concerning the contents of an urn was rather uninspired.)" �� Emily Martin a young comedic performer living (not all that well) in Los Angeles takes a costly last-minute flight back to her former home in Austin Tex. to visit the now-ailing cat she left there with her ex-boyfriend. The cat also this movie��s title character has some metaphoric weight representing the life Emily left behind. She now wonders if she should have." during which Emily has a semi-meltdown and spills food all over a borrowed dress leads her into the view of a waitress Jen (Daniella Pineda) who��s still pursuing the boho dream in the increasingly bourgeois town. Under Jen��s wing Emily gets reacquainted with the less proper side of Austin in which she��s still sometimes at a loss. Potentially topless bathing at the local swimming hole and other challenges lead Emily to some poor decisions (she opts to sleep with a man who��s a little too much like the Los Angeles dirtbags she��s been hooking up with) and some maybe less-poor ones (delivering a few genuine apologies) as she ties up loose ends."

a bookish musical cultivated woman dragged into the mud by the blunt force of her husband��s will and Jamie a dissolute poetic soul of the kind Tennessee Williams would have recognized ��� are in some ways more dangerous to the Jacksons. Ronsel has seen enough of the world and tasted enough freedom to find the strictures of home intolerable. His insistence on behaving like a citizen already puts him at risk: After both world wars black veterans were frequent targets of white violence. But Jamie in his blithe disregard for local norms is protected in a way Ronsel is not and his refusal to grasp that asymmetry has terrible consequences." the aimless soldiers�� talk between Jamie and Ronsel Laura��s lonely patience Henry��s simmering insecurity ��� and the graceful performances that bring them to life. The way those instances of ordinary human tenderness and decency stand out is proof of the film��s achievement which is to lay bare a world in which cruelty is normal and injustice seems as implacable as the weather." though is the land those people inhabit a sometimes dusty sometimes swampy area of broad fields and dirt roads that seems indifferent to human concerns. The cinematographer Rachel Morrison brings the soil the flora and the weather to life in a way that emphasizes the archaic elemental power of the story. Its modern implications are supplied by a cast of subtle actors and by Ms. Rees��s knack for psychological nuance an attentiveness to quiet moments and unstated emotions that animates her earlier films the independent coming-of-age drama ���Pariah�� and the HBO biopic ���Bessie.��" unevenly painfully. It is also as the title suggests about how things don��t change about the stubborn forces of custom prejudice and power that lock people in place and impede social progress. Set mainly in the Mississippi Delta in the years just after World War II when Jim Crow was still enshrined in law and practice the film directed by Dee Rees tests and complicates William Faulkner��s much-quoted claim about the not-even-pastness of the past. It��s a work of historical imagination that lands in the present with disquieting illuminating force." crowded plot. Relying on multiple narrators to tell a tale (as Ms. Jordan does) is a common enough novelistic technique but movies sometimes sag under the weight of even a single voice-over. The half-dozen voices who reflect on the meaning of the onscreen action might have been distracting or confusing but instead remarkably enough they provide an almost musical structure and a feeling of moral gravity. What happens is a communal tragedy but one that is experienced differently by everyone involved." through years of toil to arrive at a measure of stability and the guarded hope that something better might be possible in the future. The land they work is purchased by Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke) whose agriculture and business skills fall short of his ambitions. He and his wife Laura (Carey Mulligan) come to rely on Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige). Henry��s feckless younger brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) befriends the Jacksons�� oldest son Ronsel (Jason Mitchell). Both Ronsel and Jamie are combat veterans and their natural camaraderie breaks the rules of racial separation particularly infuriating Jamie and Henry��s father a hateful old cur they call Pappy (Jonathan Banks)." quite a lot happens ��� a bit too much perhaps. There are subplots that might have been excised and twists that are a little too contorted. But Ms. Rees also knows that plot is not everything and she uses Ms. Jordan��s busy narrative as a trellis rather than an engine. What happens is less important finally than who it is happening to." slur-spewing villainy verges on caricature but ���Mudbound�� does not pretend that his is the only or even the most insidious face of white supremacy. Nor does the film locate the poison of racism principally in the attitudes and feelings of the dominant race. What Hap and Florence are up against as they try to provide for their children and hold onto their dignity is a system of organized expropriation ��� a heritage of plunder (to borrow a term from the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates) designed to keep them poor precarious and dependent. Their labor provides an insurance policy for Henry��s bad luck and incompetence. Their successes will be punished so his failures can be mitigated and his entitlement upheld. What��s theirs is his." the racial history of the American South tends to be flattened into reassuring morality tales in which black lives matter less than white consciences. Ms. Jordan��s book occasionally wanders in the direction of this kind of soothing redemptive storytelling ��� the white characters are split a bit too neatly into the righteous and the wicked their black counterparts confined to salt-of-the-earth nobility ��� but the movie resists this tendency. Its people members of two families knotted together by fate hate and economics are complicated. The wounds are raw."

all while flipping from Kaufman to Mr. Carrey and then to Mr. Carrey as Mr. Kaufman. (The editor is Barry Poltermann.) You never get lost amid all these multiple identities and realities which Mr. Smith amusingly at times alarmingly gathers together. It��s funny watching Milos Forman ��� who directed ���Man on the Moon�� ��� refer to Mr. Carrey as Andy but when Mr. Carrey turns into Tony Clifton something more sinister and menacing comes through. Is this art indulgence or madness? As this documentary reminds you with hard laughter and startlingly intense emotion comedy always needs its pound of flesh." one that��s been constructed from fragments of its two title subjects and their work. In one corner of the portrait there��s something from Mr. Carrey��s life (a story about his father a glimpse of an early routine); in another something from Kaufman��s personal history (his family his work his illness). Sometimes these fragments rest side by side at other times they overlap. And every so often Kaufman��s notorious alter ego Tony Clifton an obnoxious lounge lizard muscles in to upend the entire thing." an uncertainty that fits the movie��s exploration of reality and its simulations. By contrast the documentary��s genesis which is partly spelled out in title cards is rather clearer and can be traced to some 100 hours of behind-the-scenes video shot during the making of ���Man on the Moon.�� This material had been stashed in Mr. Carrey��s offices for almost 20 years until the director Spike Jonze (���Her��) a producer on ���Jim & Andy �� persuaded Mr. Carrey to do something with it. Mr. Smith whose earlier titles include ���American Movie�� and ���The Yes Men �� was hired and smartly set his focus on Mr. Carrey." who died from lung cancer in 1984 was a standup who hit the mainstream playing Latka Gravas a mechanic of indeterminate national origin in the sitcom ���Taxi.�� That show was a critical favorite if not a ratings behemoth and it goosed the big-screen careers of some of its players (Danny DeVito Christopher Lloyd). Kaufman wasn��t made for movies but in live shows as well as on ���Saturday Night Live�� and on talk shows (David Letterman) he continued to test the limits of his singular absurdist comedy by assuming the guise of innocent fools or spectacularly awful louts. Kaufman is still sometimes referred to as a cult comic a category that skews reductive decades later." they also gush. The giggles start with the playful title: ���Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond ��� Featuring a Very Special Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton.�� It��s an amusing pileup that in its excess hints at the rich weirdness that emerged when Mr. Carrey nearly went off the rails playing Kaufman in the biopic ���Man on the Moon.�� One of those tidy fumbled stories of genius it will be forever supplanted by this movie��s dizzily fantastically entertaining account of its two strange twinned and messy geniuses." largely through Mr. Carrey��s experiences playing him. By the time Mr. Carrey signed on to make ���Man on the Moon�� (1999) he was a major movie star having appeared in both commercial hits (���Dumb and Dumber��) and critical successes (���The Truman Show��). Physically he may have seemed a bit off to play Kaufman (too lanky too crowned with hair) but he took on the role with painstaking if seemingly typical actorly mimicry. Mr. Carrey found the character in big and little ways: in Kaufman��s many voices his fixed stare and in the walks stances and gestures he used to play characters or when he was just being (or playing) Andy." Mr. Carrey also lost himself at least for a while (though maybe longer). The story of what happened during the making of ���Man on the Moon�� has been covered before including in news articles published around the time of its release. In one a journalist who visited the set during production noted that Mr. Carrey never broke character even after cut was called. In another account Mr. DeVito who played George Shapiro Andy Kaufman��s manager in ���Man on the Moon �� said Mr. Carrey dove so deeply into his role as Kaufman that ���Jim only came to work two days during the filming.�� That sure sounds like the final word on the Carrey-Kaufman cinematic convergence." ���Jim & Andy�� reveals that those earlier reports ��� which read as if yet another performer had taken the whole Method acting thing a touch too far ��� hardly get at the strangeness that materialized (and lingers). ���So Jim how would you start this movie? �� an offscreen Mr. Smith asks Mr. Carrey at the start. Seated in what looks like an anonymous hotel room and wearing a luxurious beard and a leather jacket Mr. Carrey grunts softly and glances away. And then looking directly into the camera he says: ���Well if I had my choice it wouldn��t start at all. It would already have been.�� Mr. Carrey breaks into a small ambiguous smile. ���And it wouldn��t end either.��"

The hero of her book and its sequels is Parvana a young girl we first see in this movie with her father an out-of-work teacher. They are selling some prized possessions in a market square when Parvana��s father is arrested without charges." Parvana disguises herself as a boy to provide for her mother older sister and baby brother. As she deals with ever-mounting difficulties she expands on a story she and her father had started to concoct before his arrest. Depicted in cutout animation style it tells of a young prince out to confront an elephant king." an animated film set in Afghanistan made largely by Westerners and based on a Western source might raise some red flags. But I think ���The Breadwinner�� is worth celebrating in part because it is a work that in some ways qualifies as reportage." and they are depicted frankly but in a way that encourages young viewers to form an affinity with the characters rather than cringe at terror. The director Nora Twomey has a nuanced way with characterization and action and the voice cast led by Saara Chaudry of ���Degrassi: The Next Generation �� is terrific. In its alternating of Parvana��s day-to-day struggle with the tale she tells herself the movie doesn��t promote bromides about stories and storytelling transcending reality. Rather it demonstrates that the way imagination refracts reality can provide not only solace but also real-world strategy."

When the helmet is removed we know how he knows what he knows: His young face is scarred his earlobes are little flaps and his eyes are seemingly tear-shaped giving him a perpetual sad-puppy expression." one that the film��s location manager conjured up from the most genteel corners of Brooklyn and Manhattan (as well as New Westminster British Columbia where the interior of the family��s brownstone was built on a warehouse stage). So Auggie whose father Nate (Owen Wilson) has a job that lets him wear a suit and sneakers is certainly going to a good school. Nonetheless he knows that he will encounter bullies and he does.

Palacio hews to the book��s multicharacter narration structure. This tactic reminded me of a line in Jean Renoir��s classic ���The Rules of the Game�� about everybody having their own reasons for their behavior. In Renoir��s movie that fact is called a ���truly terrible thing.�� In the world of this film understanding another person��s reasons is the first step in establishing meaningful communication. During the section of the film narrated by Auggie��s older sister Via (Izabela Vidovic) you learn why in an awkward first conversation with her future boyfriend she impulsively tells him that she��s an only child despite the fact that she loves and ardently protects her little brother." and the 27 operations he��s endured to deal with them as ���hilarious.�� But Auggie is less amused by the prospect of entering the fifth grade and no longer being home-schooled by his brilliant and loving mother Isabel Pullman (Julia Roberts)." who wrote the screenplay with Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne the movie has a cast that��s wonderful from top to bottom. As Auggie��s parents Ms. Roberts and Mr. Wilson are doing things we love to see those actors doing. (Ms. Roberts lets loose with her trademark ebullient laugh at least once and Mr. Wilson explains life��s issues to Auggie in a droll drawl.) All the young people in the ensemble anchored by Mr. Tremblay��s Auggie are perfect."

The relationship between the two halves of the film like every other relationship in it remains somewhat enigmatic.

Or one could be a fantasy contained within the other though it might be hard to say which is which." ���On the Beach at Night Alone�� is not difficult.

In March following a great deal of rumor and scandal in the Korean news media Mr. Hong and Ms. Kim admitted to their own affair which contributed to the end of Mr. Hong��s marriage. ���On the Beach at Night Alone�� has been seen as a confession and an explanation of their affair an act of self-revelation on the part of both the director and the star." romantic disaffection startling zooms and the consumption of many bottles of soju. ���On the Beach at Night Alone �� one of three features directed by Mr. Hong presented at festivals this year is split into two parts ��� the first set in Hamburg Germany the second in the South Korean seaside city of Gangneung ��� and includes an extended awkward zoom-punctuated scene of drunken recrimination." at times acute at times coy on the nature of cinema and the reliability of narrative.

He��s also pretty much of a yawn." �� the newest DC Comics superhero jam directed by Zack Snyder is looser goosier and certainly more watchable than the last one. The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie ���Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice �� was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay etc.) but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup. The story is a confusion of noise visual clutter and murderous digital gnats but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through." which makes sense for a character who��s been partly cobbled together from scraps and a sob story that Mr. Fisher puts across with bowed head and palpable heaviness. The hoodie he sometimes wears which can��t help but evoke Trayvon Martin imparts a larger meaning that the movie doesn��t or can��t explore. Like the references to a coming world catastrophe that suggestively shudders with wider implications the hoodie suggests filmmakers who are still struggling to keep an eye on the offscreen world while spinning a fictional universe that can somehow offer a brief escape from it." desaturated palette that borders on the murky and this movie��s chaotic unimaginative action scenes can drag on forever. But the touches of humor in ���Justice League�� lighten the whole thing tonally and are a relief after the dirgelike ���Batman v Superman �� which he ran into the ground with a two-and-a-half-hour running time. (���Justice League�� clocks in at a not-exactly fleet two hours.) Written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon the new movie shows a series that��s still finding its footing as well as characters who though perhaps not yet as ostensibly multidimensional as Marvel��s may be more enduring (and golden). It has justice and it has banter. And while it could have used more hanging out more breeziness it is a start." but his costume remains grievously larger than Batman��s (or Bruce��s) personality. Bat-Bruce clearly has some kind of unrequited thing for Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot a charming super-presence) which leads him to stammer like a teenager. (She��s got other things on her mind.) He has money and a modest sense of humor including about his wealth which inspires one of the movie��s few decent laughs. Mr. Affleck a generally appealing actor who can plumb the depths when pushed (���Gone Girl��) needs something more substantial (or just more jokes) if his Batman is ever going to work." the little bit of bat brooding in ���Justice League�� feels unmotivated and unearned and lacks the shading of the character in the ���Dark Knight�� or even in the Lego movies. That��s too bad and would be dire if he played a more valuable role. But ���Justice League�� is about solidarity rather than flying and soaring solo so the movie spends considerable time piecing together its newest parts: the Flash a.k.a. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) a zippy wisenheimer wreathed in lightning; Aquaman a.k.a. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) an underwater tough with a chest full of muscles and tattoos; and Cyborg a.k.a. Victor Stone (Ray Fisher) a machine man built from metal and serious attitude." and so is Lois Lane (Amy Adams shedding tears and largely wasted). Everything is about to get worse because of course it has to leading Bat-Bruce and Wonder-Diana to round up a troika that was teased earlier. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the introductions to these three newcomers who step up beauty pageant-style to fill in some back story ��� one has roots in Atlantis the other two are from hard-luck city ��� while flexing individual quirks and superpowers."

She isn��t just palpably lonely she��s burdened with stern religious parents (Henrik Rafaelsen and Ellen Dorrit Petersen) who are just shy of clich�. They don��t seem especially bad. Yet there��s something disquieting about their insistent attention on her how they check in with Thelma nightly drilling her ��� pleasantly yet somehow unctuously ��� about studies and meals as if she needed a firm hand or they were doing a prison head count. She goes along mostly but Thelma also gently pushes back." partly because the movie begins twice first with a disturbing scene in which a man points a rifle at a girl in a desolate winter tableau. If this girl is our girl the movie isn��t exactly saying. Instead the story shifts to Oslo where it settles in for a long while with Thelma who��s recently started college. She seems a bit down but otherwise appears to be O.K. even if she��s living alone (and out of her suitcase) in one of those spookily anonymous apartment buildings where no one knows your name or cares." which is when the movie gets its party seriously started. The mood and tone dramatically shift and a murder of crows gathers in the foreboding sky as if ready to join Hitchcock��s ���Birds.�� Thelma sees a lovely stranger and falls into a mysterious fit violently shaking.

It��s a coming-of-age story rooted in the tradition of the European art film but it flirts heavily with the horror genre. It��s also a romance a psychological thriller a liberation story and a whodunit (and why). Mostly and most satisfyingly it plays with the female Gothic those unnerving tales ��� churning with desires and dread and quivering with anxiety and suspicion ��� in which women are at once the victims and agents of change." Mr. Trier��s experimenting mostly works especially when the genre pieces dovetail with his gifts and Thelma��s story. In time she takes on the mystery of her strange fits and other weird goings-on a search which Mr. Trier tries to complicate with a little detour about patriarchy and female sexuality that briefly turn an oblique tale into an anxiously explanatory one. It��s unnecessary as are some of the obvious scares. Mr. Trier has a great talent for making loneliness visceral and visible for showing how pain can make the world disappear. Thelma��s anguish can shatter a wall of glass but her story is never more frighteningly true than when she��s just another lonely girl in the frame." Thelma (Eili Harboe) looks like a classic innocent one of those obedient child-women whose desires bring knowledge and grief.

It is a very opulent train and the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos gets all its ornate detail. It also gets the detail of the mostly C.G.I. special effects and settings and here the marriage of digital and analog is awkward. In further pursuit of 65-millimeter shots Mr. Branagh opens up the story regularly however.

He has Poirot deliver his final summation of the case in a train tunnel." with the actor testing how many of the beloved character��s irritating yet endearing quirks could be pushed to the limits of coherence.

He��s nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy ��� an actor��s landscape ��� while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson a transitional still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was history tells us a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 a president who declared an ���unconditional war�� on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam." ���LBJ�� is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelson��s talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang but he��s booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. That��s too bad especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies ��� ���Selma �� ���Jackie �� ���Marshall�� ��� that both directly and obliquely speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s." these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent onscreen and off the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters ���LBJ�� doesn��t look all that different from most other great-man stories. Yet there are moments ��� Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins ��� when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white male power bare in all its ugliness. In scenes like these the movie inches around complexity even as it continues to clear the way for another make-believe savior." and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether he��s barnstorming through politics slamming down phones lobbing obscenities braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. He��s fun to watch despite the facial makeup which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasn��t thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in ���Point Break.�� It��s a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays Lady Bird only when she started talking." which tracks Johnson��s road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nation��s healer after John F. Kennedy��s death. It��s a near-miraculous compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment it��s 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office."

Mr. Crowley was found dead in January 2015 along with his wife and daughter in what police concluded was a double homicide and suicide: He had shot his family and then himself. Perhaps because Mr. Crowley was drawn to the paranoid fringe (he is shown meeting and watching Alex Jones) the deaths became a cause for conspiracy theorists." �� which is engrossing for the reasons it��s also unsatisfying: As Adam Shambour a friend of Mr. Crowley��s says it��s a mystery that answers all the major questions except ���Why?��" Erik Nelson (a producer on ���Grizzly Man��) explores the disjunction between the charismatic filmmaker-to-be with a penchant for both self-promotion and self-documentation and a man who was it eventually seems clear descending into mental illness.

though. The film like the characters feels like it��s working things out as it goes along. This is sometimes fascinating and sometimes frustrating. The performances don��t always connect. Mr. Cranston leaning into a New York accent his hands and face perpetually in motion has the busy energy of a stage actor. Mr. Fishburne is a master of stillness and the dissonance between them isn��t just a matter of the differences between Sal and Mueller. I never made the imaginative leap from performance to reality. The actors somehow got in the way of the characters." �� Mr. Linklater��s new feature is a suite for three voices. It��s a lot of other things too. A war movie in its way and also a road picture and a memory play. Set in 2003 at the stage of the Iraq war when we were assured that the mission was being handily accomplished it brings together three Vietnam veterans for a somber task. Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) are former Marines. Larry Shepherd (Steve Carell) ��� his nickname was Doc ��� served in the Navy. Long-buried bad memories shadow their reunion and complicate their camaraderie and the circumstances of their meeting dredges up the painful and complex legacy of their not-so-long-ago war." Doc served time in the brig and received a bad-conduct discharge ��� he mordantly calls it a ���better career decision�� ��� a fact that connects ���Last Flag Flying�� to an earlier work Hal Ashby��s ���The Last Detail.�� That movie released in 1973 and starring Jack Nicholson Randy Quaid and Otis Young was based on a novel by Darryl Ponicsan whose sequel to that book is the basis of Mr. Linklater��s film. (Mr. Linklater and Mr. Ponicsan collaborated on the screenplay.)" and they also leave a lot unsaid. Mr. Linklater avoids flashbacks and other obvious ways of connecting the film��s present to its implied past. We don��t see any combat either in Iraq or Vietnam which gives the verbal accounts of what happened in those places extra weight and mystery. There is some political venting ��� none of which fits in a tidy ideological box ��� but mostly a lot of bluster chops-busting and reminiscing to pass the time." and also where he married and raised the son whose burial is the purpose of the journey. The young man who had enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school died in Baghdad in what the military officially described as an ambush. Doc has sought out his old buddies ��� though the nature of their friendship is one of many ambiguities ��� to help bring his boy home. He refuses the offer of burial at Arlington National Cemetery a choice that frustrates an officious colonel (Yul Vazquez) but that must nonetheless be honored. A member of the son��s company (J. Quinton Johnson) accompanies the older men." it is nonetheless enormously thought-provoking and its roughness is a sign of how earnestly it grapples with matters that other movies about war prefer not to think about. It is about the much-discussed division between members of the military and the rest of society and also about the less frequently acknowledged conflicts within and among those who fight. It uses the language of heroism and sacrifice to challenge popular sentimental notions of what those things mean and to connect individual ethics with collective morality. None of that is easy and what may be hardest to bear is the awareness that a country can sometimes look smaller than the people who serve it." �� ���Dazed and Confused�� and ���Waking Life�� ��� he quiets the engine of plot keeps the camera at a polite attentive distance and lets people talk. The content of the conversations is important but so are the more subtle kinds of information that human speech conveys: the unstated emotions and idiosyncrasies of character that flow alongside and underneath the words." mostly by train toward Portsmouth N.H. stopping along the way to break up the trip and vary the scenery." Sal and Mueller are a perhaps too-perfectly mismatched set of contrasting styles and attitudes. Doc younger than the other two ��� he was just a kid when they all first got mixed up together ��� is the quietest a timid soul trying not to shrivel up with grief. Sal is the wild man a motor mouth whose high spirits you feel could turn into violent rage in the blink of an eye. Mueller is a reformed hell-raiser who shut the door on his past sobered up and found a measure of peace as a minister and the patriarch of a thriving family."

which is perhaps Mr. Waititi��s truest achievement here. For a guy who looks chiseled by Michelangelo Mr. Hemsworth can be a surprisingly agile physical performer capable of real bounce and he clearly likes ricocheting off walls as much as he does ceding center stage to the other actors. These include Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie who after an unpromising entrance develops into a real character with emotion and an all-too-brief flashback filled with fury beauty liquid motion and mythological mystery." and a conceptual makeover was necessary ��� and not just to boost his box-office appeal. Marvel could have gone grimmer broodier and sterner but that isn��t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier sillier and funnier. It��s a good fit at least for a while. Like some other superheroes Thor has been good for the occasional light mocking laugh often hooked to his otherworldly identity: He��s a god (as he likes to announce) son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and so forth. For much of ���Ragnarok �� he��s a playfully sustained joke." �� the latest Marvel blowout to feature the god of thunder where he tries to start a jet using a voice-activated password. He needs to make a getaway ��� he��s neck deep in trouble and plot entanglements ��� so identifies himself as the ���strongest Avenger.�� No dice. Given his earlier stand-alone movies Thor might have had better luck cracking the code if he��d copped to being the ���most boring Avenger.��" the director Taika Waititi (���Hunt for the Wilderpeople��) has a charmingly idiosyncratic human touch and a gift for turning goofiness and gab into personality. That gift is first evident here in the intimate huddles between Thor and whoever happens to be within chatting (or shouting) distance. There��s a lot of yakking some barking; at one point Odin does some god-splaining. The Chatty Cathies also include Thor��s sister Hela (a vamping Cate Blanchett) an overgrown Goth Girl with smudged eye makeup and killer dominatrix looks who plays very hard. She lusts for Odin��s realm which remains as drearily amorphous and anonymous as before." Chris Hemsworth the Thor movies have been largely forgettable memorable mostly for the upstaging antics of his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and as a bad fit for Natalie Portman (Thor��s former love interest now mercifully banished into the storytelling cornfield). ���Ragnarok�� tries hard to change that profile and mostly succeeds by knocking its big blond beauty consistently down to size. It makes sense for all sorts of reasons including that superheroes can so easily appear to be on the wrong side of history especially those who look like Aryan cartoons." machinations and useful coincidences. (Eric Pearson Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay.) Soon after Hela appears she moves back home and Thor lands elsewhere allowing her to run amok ��� kill strut repeat ��� and him to leisurely settle into his new more lighthearted mode until it��s serious hammer time. Much of his great un-Thoring happens on Sakaar a planetary garbage dump run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum comically jiving and dithering) a psychopath Auntie Mame in flowing gold lam� and blue fingernail polish who suggests a low-rent version of Stanley Tucci��s host in ���The Hunger Games.��" because it��s a reminder of the narrative ambition and mythic grandeur that��s often reduced in this franchise to epic fights fancy elocution and special effects. It��s amusing how ���Ragnarok�� humanizes Thor yet in doing so it dilutes his Thorness the essential qualities that make him more than a dude with a cool hammer. And the more familiar and less godlike he becomes the more evident it is that this series has never figured out how to make his myth fit with the modern world. So it��s made Thor a fish out of water and a recurrent punch line. Now though with Thor (and Mr. Hemsworth) at last settled in what he needs is a myth as mighty as his shtick." an exasperatingly lazy and uninteresting story development that is mostly (mostly) alleviated by Mr. Waititi��s handling of the material. It��s here that the vibe relaxes and the picture��s filigree becomes brighter and wittier as extras with puffball hairdos straight out of Dr. Seuss light up the background. It��s also here that Thor reunites with the Hulk who��s been crushing the gladiatorial competition on an extended incredible bender. After he and Thor engage in some Steinbeckian George-and-Lennie riffing the Hulk��s inner mouse Bruce Banner takes over and Mark Ruffalo eases in to help turn the temperature from hot to cozy."

It oversimplifies Istvan��s motivation for issuing an accusation against a friend. The modernist-style score by Tibor Szemzo is more distracting than atmospheric especially when it riffs on Max Bruch��s widely used composition for Kol Nidre a Yom Kippur prayer that seems inappropriate for this particular context. And by design the movie is something of a tease more interested in setup than in payoff.

His name is Christian he��s played by the lean and handsome actor Claes Bang and he��s the chief curator at an important Stockholm museum. Christian has done something that seemed like a good idea at the time but it made someone else unhappy enough to threaten vengeance and now Christian is truly sorry. So he does what any decent person would which is make a video mea culpa on his phone and send it to his victim." even though ���The Square�� is often quite funny and once or twice ��� in particular during an aggressive performance at a black-tie gala dinner ��� genuinely provocative. The condition it depicts is one that will be familiar to just about anyone who buys a ticket and its insights might have been generated by a Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism smartphone app. Christian and his tribe are obsessed with political correctness but can��t figure out how to behave decently.

Within its boundaries this patch of sidewalk will be a place where mutual respect and individual responsibility are the rule. The slightly larger rectangular dimensions of the screen are governed by the exceptions. But both versions of ���The Square�� practice an aesthetics of shaming laying bare the hypocrisy the selfishness and the wishful thinking embedded in the deep structures of 21st-century metropolitan existence." or perhaps vice versa. Christian magnetic and intelligent strikes an appealing balance of smugness and sensitivity. He has a very cool job with some very cool perks and he turns his entitlement into a virtue by ostentatiously caring about the world��s problems and supposing that his behavior is really the expression of that concern. Shots of homeless people beggars and poor immigrants emphasize his bad faith but they also replicate it and pass it along to the audience. The joke is on everyone." and his view of Christian is affectionate as well as punitive. ���The Square�� is ultimately a long version of Christian��s rambling apology ostentatiously smart maybe too much so for its own good but ultimately complacent craven and clueless." he also feels compelled to note that the problem isn��t just a matter of his own thoughtlessness. (I��m refraining from saying what he did since like everything else that happens in ���The Square �� it��s too surprising to spoil and too weird to explain.) There are social forces and economic structures at work he says large historical tendencies that both extend and extenuate his guilt. Immigration. Inequality. Social alienation. Global capitalism. That kind of thing. Christian knows a billionaire ��� a donor to the museum ��� who might be able to throw enough money at the problem to solve it. But even then ��_" of course the movie is a string of such events though it manages to fool or at least to tease the characters as well as the viewers. The robbery that sets the main plot in motion seems at first like an art-world provocation and before he quite understands what has happened Christian experiences the kind of thrill that art is supposed to elicit. His one night stand with an American journalist (Elisabeth Moss) is not so thrilling but its very awkwardness has an arch knowing quality. Staff meetings at the museum have a similar feel. Is the baby whom one of Christian��s colleagues brings into the room really his child? Is its presence a commentary on the persistence of innocence in a fallen world? What about Christian��s own daughters? Can any human action or feeling be called natural or real?" whose film before this one was the squirmy incisive ���Force Majeure �� takes aim at some pretty fat satirical targets ��� art taste sex and money for starters ��� and sprays buckshot at the audience as well as in his own face.

Women whisper and stare men sputter and rage and soon all their white faces have gone red. Before long unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the family��s home edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage. And then the fences go up and the clusters develop into a pack. The whispers morph into jeers and the progressively dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin. Any resemblance to the audience watching ���Suburbicon�� is as intentional as it is obvious." lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature novels and movies ever since suburbs were invented. In ���Little Boxes �� a 1960s lament about conformity Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland where all the ���boys go into business and marry and raise a family.�� That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge one that ���Suburbicon�� delivers anew with cruel laughter violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling." graver flaw though the one that empties ���Suburbicon�� out and turns it into a mannerist exercise is that the movie reproduces the inequality it��s ostensibly outraged by. This has less to do with star power and everything to do with emphasis and interest. It��s clear even from her few scenes including a showdown with a racist that Ms. Westbrook could have made Mrs. Mayers a force if given the chance. Yet despite the parallel editing despite the scenes of the mob plaguing the Mayerses ��� and the images of a black mother father and son who are sometimes seen but say so little ��� their terror isn��t about them. It��s about how bad it makes white people look." some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife Rose (Julianne Moore) and son Nicky (a good appealing Noah Jupe) at home. It all looks neat and tidy especially Suburbicon a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardner��s sack suits and yards that look as if they��d been landscaped using a compass and protractor. There are a few midcentury modern flourishes but the sheer overriding bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like ���Father Knows Best�� rather than a riposte like ���Mad Men.��" �� a jaundiced hard-sell comedy wants you to know that the American dream was always a crock. This may not be news even in the movie industry which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact. Still every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution. The latest complainant is George Clooney who in directing ���Suburbicon�� has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob." �� including visually and with his two appealing child actors who together give the movie a heartbeat. As the story grows grimmer and pulpier he plays with different registers of realism deepens the shadows and narrows his focus using tight close-ups and all the wood paneling to box the characters in. But he skimps on the adult characters�� inner lives and once the narrative weight shifts to the Lodges he never finds the tone that balances the movie��s sincerity with its nihilism. One problem is that Mr. Clooney seems to believe in happy endings however hard-earned while the Coens ��� whose presence hovers throughout ��� are the kind of pessimists who laugh in the dark. The tones and worldviews don��t jibe." who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov ��� reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen ��� has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle. Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images. That there aren��t any movie stars in the Mayers family though is an early sign that all isn��t quite as balanced as it seems. Karimah Westbrook has a few good moments as Mrs. Mayers but Leith Burke as Mr. Mayers barely says a word. Tony Espinosa has more to do as the couple��s son Andy." the families are further aligned when shortly after the Mayerses move in two thugs invade the Lodge home. Except instead of simply robbing the family they kill someone violence that shifts the story��s focus to the Lodges. It��s a lurching turn as well as a missed opportunity. The story of the Mayers family is grounded in the history that clearly appeals to Mr. Clooney ��� it��s based on events that took place in Levittown Pa. in 1957 ��� but what happens to the Lodges plays like one of the Coens�� signature Looney Tunes as written by James M. Cain. By the time Oscar Isaac swoops in with a fedora and a wolfish grin the movie has become a bludgeoning pastiche."

During Maya��s t��te-��-t��tes we get a glimpse of her home but every room in her mountainside hideaway has the same sickly hues of blue and green.

Which is not to say that Mr. Dunne a very canny filmmaker doesn��t accomplish a lot via implication. The movie is subtly bracketed by readings of Ms. Didion��s appreciation of John Wayne in an early essay and her excoriation of Vice President Dick Cheney in a later one. Unlike a great many more facile thinkers Ms. Didion clearly does not consider them equivalent figures. But the citation of both works illuminates the changes in Ms. Didion��s thinking over the years." but opens it up in others. Mr. Dunne��s longtime family connections and his own prestige as a filmmaker no doubt helped him snag interviews that other documentarians would be hard-pressed to schedule. Ms. Didion��s friend Calvin Trillin is among the interviewees and while I��d never dare suggest that great writer is not a big get I was impressed in a different way when Harrison Ford showed up." among other things the counterculture she admittedly lost faith in ���the social contract �� but did not turn left for solutions; rather she staked a claim as a kind of ideological outsider.

The movie is directed by Griffin Dunne one of Ms. Didion��s nephews who also appears as an onscreen interviewer. The Dunne-Didions are a storied family whose members are and have been significant cultural forces. They are also a clan rived by tragedy.

Their passion isn��t pretty but awkward and pasty and explicit: two frantic strangers grappling in the muck of the moors. Yet Gheorghe is skilled at handling more than newborn lambs; and as the men grow closer the glowering light grows warmer and the whole picture seems to briefly exhale." unfolding as unsentimentally as the internal exam he gives a pregnant heifer suggest someone disgusted by his own sorry self.

Rather it��s his imprisonment by a legacy he��s not sure he wants that ties his tongue and clots his emotions." �� ���God��s Own Country�� weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richards��s biting cinematography and the story��s slow unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful.

Andy Garcia and Ed Harris are the president and secretary of state while Abbie Cornish is a Secret Service agent secretly keeping company with a deputy secretary named Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess) who happens to be Jake��s younger brother. The siblings have their differences but they share an unplaceable American accent an aversion to regular shaving and a desire not to see the world destroyed by ice fire hail or heavy rain." I don��t think Gerard Butler would be my first choice. But of course I don��t have a choice. Mr. Butler��s character Jake Lawson has a job to do and so do I. Jake��s is to fix the space-based weather-control system he designed and built racing against a digital clock that counts down the minutes until ���geostorm.�� Mine involves counting the minutes until ���Geostorm�� is over and then offering a comprehensive damage assessment. To quote something Jake says to a grandstanding senator (Richard Schiff) who dares to question his expertise: you��re welcome." lists gently from side to side during zero-gravity interludes and abuses your lumbar spine when space junk starts flying. You sometimes catch a whiff of burning skyscraper a spray of monsoon mist a whoosh of gale-force wind and the gentle caress of Mr. Butler��s stubble on your cheek." actually but I��m sure they��re working on it.

never the most deft at the technical aspect of filmmaking drastically off whatever his best game is. Every camera setup is a study in inertia; every other cut is a beat or two behind where a punch line needs to land. To call this movie unwatchable would be inaccurate though the scenes featuring Mike Tornabene and Yousef Erakat portraying frat brothers who act as if they are dying to reassemble a group of Dead End Kids for Sidney Kingsley��s play are pretty painful. On the other hand the lighting is so weak ���Boo 2!�� is quite often close to unseeable." Tyler Perry��s ���Boo! A Madea Halloween�� arrived in theaters. It was hardly distinguished but it had its moments largely because of the comic interactions between the outrageous finely aged characters Madea and Joe (both played by Mr. Perry) and their fellow dyspeptic senior citizens Hattie (Patrice Lovely) and Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis)." yes it��s the same inhabited-by-30-year-olds frat from the first film. The twist this time is the fellas aren��t allowed to have a party in the house so instead they��re having it at Derrick Lake which was (cue scary music) the scene of a still-apparently-shrouded-in-mystery (with this shoddy script it��s hard to really tell) mass murder back in the 1970s. Rumor has it some kind of massacre-seeking entity haunts the premises." �� which as usual with Mr. Perry��s pictures wasn��t screened in advance for critics frequently feels more like a remake than a sequel. The movie revisits Brian Simmons (Mr. Perry) a single dad and his rebellious teenage daughter Tiffany (Diamond White). The respect-your-parents and don��t-even-think-about-having-sex lessons of the previous film have long been forgotten by the characters; if anything Tiffany now turning 18 is snottier and Brian more passive. (The movie introduces an ex-wife played by Taja V. Simpson who walks all over him and is too permissive with Tiffany.)"

since Sean and Nathan are the characters whose intimate lives it follows in most detail. But of course the point of ���BPM �� and of the movement and moment it reconstructs is that the personal and political passions can��t be easily disentangled. This is not so much argued as felt. The erotic scenes are dialectical as well as hot; the meetings have a wanton feverish energy. The air is heady with abstraction and carnality. It��s not a French movie for nothing. (Though it does serve as a fitting fictional companion piece to ���How to Survive a Plague �� David France��s magnificent documentary history of Act Up in America.)" the participants are not much nicer to one another. An early scene sets out rules and procedure ��� finger snaps instead of applause; no debating in the designated smoking area ��� which are subsequently tested and flouted.

Balloons full of fake blood are hurled at government officials and pharmaceutical executives. Meetings and conferences are disrupted. Demonstrators lie down in the street like corpses." the camera is more participant than observer and it turns a gathering of individuals into a complex collective organism. You see how people with different ideas and temperaments ��� as well as different experiences with the disease that brings them together ��� coalesce into something with a will of its own expressive of but distinct from theirs. And you also observe the way members of that composite self regain their particularity changed by their encounter with one another but still very much themselves." too. In the case of Sean (Nahuel P�rez Biscayart) and Nathan (Arnaud Valois) political solidarity personal sympathy and sexual attraction deepen into love." Mr. Campillo worked as a screenwriter on three films with Laurent Cantet: ���Time Out �� ���Heading South�� and ���The Class.�� (He also worked on Mr. Cantet��s latest film ���The Workshop.��) ���The Class�� in particular which chronicled the life of a teacher in a working-class French public school (and won a surprising Palme d��Or in Cannes) was exquisitely attuned to the emotional nuances of institutional procedure. It felt like a documentary in its attention to routine and like a melodrama in the way it galvanized currents of feeling." of course but in spite of its historical specificity ���BPM�� never feels like a bulletin from the past. Its immediacy comes in part from the brisk naturalism of the performances and the nimbleness and fluidity of the editing. The characters are so vivid so real so familiar that it��s impossible to think of their struggles ��� and in some cases their deaths ��� as unfolding in anything but the present tense. And even though some of the battles their real-life counterparts fought have been at least partly won their anger feels urgent and unassuaged. They were fighting for their lives and also forging a template of resistance." this suggestive phrase which is part of a eulogy cannot fail to resonate.

Mr. Haynes is happy to set a wolf after Ben in the woods a jaggedly shot chase bathed in midnight blue but he refrains from easy sentimentalism. (The director of photography is Ed Lachman.) As a filmmaker Mr. Haynes prefers appealing to our heads over tugging at our hearts and so for a while he keeps you at an intellectual remove." �� a lovely ode to imagination and to the stories that make us who we are.

He��s in mourning for his mother (Michelle Williams in flashback) and has a question mark ��� an absent father ��� that needs solving. First though there��s David Bowie on the turntable (���ground control to Major Tom��) and a lightning strike that leaves Ben deaf. Fearless and resourceful Ben splits for New York to find his father." as if he were demanding delight instead of earning it. Yet even as he follows Mr. Selznick��s narrative lead Mr. Haynes quietly and touchingly makes ���Wonderstruck�� his own because the wonder of the film isn��t in its story but in its telling. It��s in the expressive beauty of his images the expansiveness of his ideas and the way he naturally generously brings a once-upon-a-time girl and boy to life allowing them to find themselves ��� in their willfulness their heartbreaks and their imaginings ��� so that eventually they can find someone else." but they need a little push inspiration. Storytelling lies at the heart of ���Wonderstruck�� ��� its two children are effectively writing their way out of one reality and into another ��� and the film is chockablock with those boxed worlds with imitations of life like dioramas doll-size figurines stuffed animals illustrations and an ingenious paper city. Much like the cabinet of curiosities that Rose and Ben each discover these representations point to new worlds and alternative realities. And as they pile up Mr. Haynes joins the story��s halves with craft and wit. Rose��s half isn��t just in black and white it also emotionally and gesturally recalls a late-period silent film; Ben��s by contrast has the rough textures and bleeding colors that summon 1970s big-screen New York." generously illustrated children��s book by Brian Selznick best known for ���The Invention of Hugo Cabret.�� Martin Scorsese turned that book into ���Hugo �� a reverie about movie love that also features dead parents a grave if pluckily resourceful child many whirring yet connected parts and a preoccupation with the cinematic. The film version of ���Wonderstruck�� draws from much the same overflowing treasure-trove of ideas although Mr. Haynes (like Mr. Scorsese) often feels most energized by the many different ways human beings ��� with cinematic sights and sounds through wall shadows and painstaking miniatures ��� put the world in a box." considers identity and upends clich�s. Elsewhere this can come across as dreary even programmatic. Yet because Mr. Haynes also leads with his characters rather than his ideas his films gather force until at times with near-violent suddenness they become devastatingly skin-prickingly alive. In Mr. Haynes��s ���Far From Heaven �� his combination of playfulness and seriousness translates into a homage to Sirkian melodrama that turns into a thrilling example of the very same. And in ���Wonderstruck �� a children��s story about finding your place in the world in time becomes a Haynesian exploration of identity desire and imagination." Rose��s in black and white ��� the story the editing and the children��s deafness underscore that these two are deeply connected. The film��s mysteries include how and why they fit and its satisfactions involve seeing where the scattered bread crumbs lead. How for instance an Oscar Wilde line in Ben��s room ��� ���We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars�� ��� fits into the larger puzzle. And why after Ben asks his mother about his father the film shifts to a plaintive Rose who��s looking at a movie-magazine ad trumpeting ���Our Brightest Stars.�� Both that  Wilde epigram and Rose��s film fandom are hints clues in a story that eventually dovetails with Mr. Haynes��s interest in images and identity." whose life and adventures curiously mirror his own is Rose (Millicent Simmonds a discovery) a 12-year-old deaf girl in 1927 who yearns to escape her lonely cosseted life in Hoboken N.J. To that end following in the footsteps of countless other dreamers she too flees to New York. There she seeks out her absent mother but instead finds a cipher (Julianne Moore) a screen star who clutches fictional babes to her breast but has no time for life��s real lost children. As undaunted and determined as Ben Rose sets off again entering a world thrumming with coincidences and complications." but it gets there. Mr. Haynes��s oscillation between the story��s two halves is gracefully handled (the editor is Affonso Gon�_alves) but it can create a frustrating sense of narrative interruptus. That��s particularly true because it��s hard not to miss Rose when Ben is onscreen. Part of this has to do with the charming exoticism of her old-time world with its winking artifice and cinematic allusions. Ben��s half has its attractions including his new pal (Jaden Michael) and the sun-blasted vision of a broiling New York summer. But it��s also the section in which the machinery of Mr. Selznick��s storytelling with its mysticism and coincidences creaks the loudest."

At 89 though Aida remains evasive: She doesn��t recall that man with her and the boys in that Bergen-Belsen photo; she��s fuzzy on why she moved to Canada without Shepsel and his father. The film is called ���Aida��s Secrets�� for good reason." ���Aida��s Secrets�� chronicles one man��s late-in-life search for his brother from whom he was separated as a toddler at the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp after World War II. But the remarkable tale it tells ��� of a family split up and dispersed to different continents and the detective work required to figure out what had happened ��� turns this documentary into a fascinating mystery of reshuffled identities.

And ���in 1 000 years women will definitely rule this country.�� Believing women superior he thought they had twice ���the ability for love�� as men which would allow them to conquer the world. It��s a delicious idea although clearly we could use many more lassos." her creators and inspirers has been told elsewhere including in Jill Lepore��s book ���The Secret History of Wonder Woman.�� Ms. Robinson draws on archival sources for her telling and takes some liberties with the historical record shuffling events around to dovetail with the polymorphous possibilities she��s most interested in. The movie recurrently returns to the 1940s with Marston being grilled by a comic-book skeptic (Connie Britton) about his creation scenes that fill in some details but also interrupt the fluid narrative flow. These sequences read as a stand-in for the 1950s anti-comic-book crusade of Dr. Fredric Wertham who condemned Wonder Woman as a ���cruel ���phallic�� woman.��" using it as a clever if somewhat schematic framing device as she spins her story. There are moments of domination psychological as well as physical. There are also interludes of inducement submission and compliance mixed in with a sweet soft-focus romance that initially involves Marston and his wife a frustrated academic Elizabeth Holloway Marston (Rebecca Hall tart brisk essential) and soon includes a third Olive Byrne (a very good Bella Heathcote). A student Olive cracks open the Marstons�� marriage but instead of destroying it helps it grow into a shared liberating adventure that settles into something cozily domestic." but Ms. Robinson sees deep enduring love in its back story as well as freedom including from rigid gender roles. Her version of the idealistic professor and his two wonder women and the complex geometry that defined their relationship may be a touch fuzzier than the actual story. Certainly the real Marston didn��t have Mr. Evans��s sleek matinee-idol looks. But it��s a pleasurable fantasy as well as a gentle appealingly Utopian vision of a world in which men and women can slip from their traditional binds into new excitingly freeing configurations. Those might be surprising perhaps even a bit tight around the wrists but as Ms. Robinson suggests there are so many possibilities when you��re given room to play." Batman you��re such a square! That��s especially true when you consider the real origin of Wonder Woman the warrior with the indestructible bracelets and slightly kinky magic lasso who burst into comics in 1941. As it happens there was more kink to her story than suggested by that golden lasso which she uses to force her captives to tell the truth and looks like something from a bondage emporium. ���On Paradise Island where we play many binding games �� she says in an early comic while roping another woman ���this is considered the safest method of tying a girl��s arms!��" ���Professor Marston�� is another reminder that once upon a time people had sexual appetites and relationships as complex as those of today (or of 18th-century France) something else the movies don��t always like to admit. Occasionally grandpa might have even visited a dusty mysterious shop with sexy specialty items in front and something naughtier in back. Dr. William Moulton Marston (a winning Luke Evans) finds out just how special those items could be when he pops into a store where a man calling himself the G-string King (J.J. Feild) opens up a world of consensual power play and pleasure." �� and a few frisky binding games on tap too. A sly and thoroughly charming Trojan horse of a movie ���Professor Marston�� tells the story of the man who created Wonder Woman and the women who inspired him both in and out of bed. The movie gleams and has all the smooth surfaces and persuasive detail of a typical period picture ��� the fedoras the rides the Katharine Hepburn trousers. All that luster which too often in movies suggests polite manners and drowsily safe entertainment proves to be a seductive glossy way into something more satisfyingly complicated." life has already become interesting for Marston. The writer-director Angela Robinson lays out just how well knotty it all is with wit sympathy and economy. Spanning decades the story takes flight in 1928 with Marston teaching young lovelies at Radcliffe. ���Are you normal?�� he asks of a beaming receptive audience that serves as an amusing stand-in for the viewer. Marston has answers to that and other questions along with a theory he calls DISC ��� for dominance inducement submission and compliance ��� which sounds terribly complex and slightly ridiculous.

Even moviegoers who know ���Psycho�� backward and forward ��� who consider it a sacred text and who have read Stephen Rebello��s excellent book ���Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ���Psycho���� ��� are bound to learn something new from the movie which addresses the shower scene from critical historical theoretical and technical angles down to the blinding white of the bathroom tiles." and it��s easy to tell who is dabbling and who has pored over the sequence again and again to understand its effect. It��s a screen moment to treat with total reverence ��� and so enduring it could sustain ���78/52: Part 2.��" although seeing Marli Renfro the pinup model who served as Janet Leigh��s body double is a special treat. Much of the movie��s appeal lies in the more off-kilter observations: The curator Timothy Standring discusses the particular version of ���Susanna and the Elders�� that hangs over Norman Bates��s peephole and notes that of all the renditions of that scene the one Hitchcock used strongly connotes voyeurism. Guillermo del Toro expounds on how the shower scene expresses Hitchcock��s Catholic sense of guilt ��� it shows Marion who has committed adultery and theft trying to cleanse herself of a sin that can��t be washed away." it��s no surprise that the editors have much to say. Walter Murch who took part in creating a tribute to the shower scene in ���The Conversation �� annotates portions of Hitchcock��s sequence cut by cut. Amy E. Duddleston the editor of Gus Van Sant��s 1998 not-quite replica of a remake looks at the differences between the original and her version pondering why hers didn��t play. Mr. Rebello relays a funny anecdote (also in his book) about how Hitchcock selected just the right variety of melon ��� casaba ��� to mimic the sound of a knife piercing flesh." the critic Andrew Sarris one of the original champions of ���Psycho �� wrote of how a student had spotted a hidden meaning in Hitchcock��s editing of a scene with Sheriff Chambers (John McIntire).

He incorporates reams of information in the movie sometimes through interviews or through data that crawls along the screen ticker-tape style. Every so often he folds in an elegant or haunting quote giving you something to think about as the camera shows a world in which step by step crisis by crisis borders have become by turns absurd and immaterial." Mr. Ai is a major art-world figure who��s had a more modest cinematic profile until now. He��s directed other nonfiction titles and is the subject of Alison Klayman��s very fine feature documentary ���Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry �� which was shot when he was still living in China. Although Mr. Ai occasionally shows up in ���Human Flow �� in oblique glimpses and hovering at the edges of the frame he plays an appropriately discreet role in his own documentary. In one scene he walks along a waterfront where refugees are arriving by boat; elsewhere he comforts a distraught woman and to his credit makes the scene about her and not him." including a half-dozen drone operators were involved in this worldwide journey.)

It��s a soothing almost meditative vision as well as a seductive dream of nature as a balm and refuge. This pacific picture though is soon replaced by far more disturbing recurrent images of perilously small boats filled with frantically shouting gesturing men women and children seeking asylum. In one makeshift port and then another there is splashing and disembarking and then cries and hugs as babies are gingerly passed from hand to hand. It��s a distressing familiar scene in some ways one that has been playing on our televisions for years." �� a bracing often strangely beautiful movie by the artist Ai Weiwei when it can be hard to see the individuals who make up the roiling surging rivers onscreen. This difficulty in isolating specific people ��� really seeing them as sovereign beings rather than as an undifferentiated mass ��� is crucial to the meaning of the documentary which charts the global refugee and migrant crisis. Shot over the course of one year in 23 countries the movie tracks the here and there of people whose relentless ebbing and flowing make startlingly visible what news headlines repeatedly suggest: that ours is an age of ceaseless churn with no calm in sight." its terrifying world-swallowing immensity.

the movie primarily involves Thurgood��s strategy to free Joseph. Part of what made the case important to the N.A.A.C.P. as the scholar Daniel J. Sharfstein has written was that it took place in the North instead of the South where the organization was fighting on multiple fronts. In the 1930s the activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that the idea that there was no prejudice in the North was a fable. ���The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation �� he wrote in 1934 ���is largely a difference of degree.��" including the history-making Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 which led the court to declare racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. Instead the movie focuses on a 1941 case involving Eleanor Strubing a wealthy white woman from Greenwich Conn. who accused her black chauffeur and butler Joseph Spell of raping her and then pushing her off a bridge. After hours of questioning Spell confessed. The racist reactions to the charges which invoked the dangerous Jim Crow stereotype of the ravaging black man caught the notice of N.A.A.C.P. which sent Marshall to the rescue." disturbing story flow easily but there are moments when you wish that Mr. Hudlin would ease up on the comedy. Sam in particular occasionally comes uncomfortably close to a being a caricature one of those bespectacled emasculated types who need a kick in the pants a sock in the jaw so they can man up. The broadness of the characterizations is of a piece with the movie��s anxious rhythms and relentless forward drive. These may be a function of the clock running out on Joseph along with a desire to entertain. But there��s little reflective or quiet time with the characters these men of righteous action who chase clues before swooping into court and history." trying to cram an entire life into a tidy two hours or so. ���Marshall�� smartly opts for modest. With economy a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances it revisits an early episode from the life of Thurgood Marshall the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. From the 1940s to the early ��60s he argued 32 cases before the court winning most. ���Sometimes history takes things into its own hands �� Marshall once said but he also regularly gave history a shove." she-said wrangling. The filmmakers effortlessly lay out the very real existential dangers threatening Joseph whose fate rests either with Thurgood or the howling white mob outside. But the overly broad performances especially in the zippy courtroom scenes drain the movie of nuance and blunt its realism and the contrapuntal his-and-her flashbacks add little. Ms. Hudson��s performance with its brassy and brittle notes and its counterfeit hauteur comes perilously close to cartoonish. She doesn��t do much for courtroom suspense and neither does the irresistible Mr. Brown a world-class scene-stealer whose quavering voice and pleadingly earnest eyes make the strongest case by far." the movie��s Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) rides in like a cavalry of one taking the measure of the town and its escalating tension. He��s soon joined by another lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) a button-down type who reluctantly joins the defense and reasonably fears the attention it will bring. The pair��s introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags and Sam ends up carrying the load. The scene telegraphs the shifting power dynamics Thurgood represents but it also announces that the movie will resort to easy ingratiating comedy to sell the goods." Joseph (Sterling K. Brown) and Eleanor (Kate Hudson) take their opposing seats the jury troops in and the nasty judge (James Cromwell) starts snarling. Thurgood rapidly takes the lead while slyly poking and strategically prodding Sam to rise to the occasion. Thurgood and Sam banter lash out jostle for position and occasionally deliver some stink eye especially Sam (at Thurgood). Like his character Mr. Boseman is the star of this show while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief.

He was also instrumental in helping other severely disabled patients regain theirs collaborating with his friend Teddy (Hugh Bonneville) an amateur inventor to design a wheelchair with a built-in ventilator and traveling to Europe to promote its use." �� an aggressively tasteful and rigorously cheerful biopic of the English disability-rights pioneer Robin Cavendish (Andrew Garfield) and his devoted wife Diana (Claire Foy)." however is smothered by a cloying fairy tale romance that turns every challenge the couple faces into a lark. (Silly dog unplugging Daddy��s breathing machine!) Their charmed existence includes a huge country house a free nanny and friends who are forever popping over for wine-soaked parties. Not even a broken respirator which strands the family on a Spanish roadside can halt the fun: Within minutes an impromptu fiesta complete with guitarists and flamenco dancers has materialized to keep them company." as Robin and Diana visit a German hospital where polio patients are housed in a futuristic nightmare of iron-lung efficiency. It��s a rebel moment of chillingly authentic horror that seems to have slipped through every bad-feeling filter the filmmakers have installed. For a movie about an extraordinary couple who rarely played it safe ���Breathe�� is all too content to do just that." this gauzy picture (produced by the couple��s son Jonathan Cavendish and directed by his friend the actor Andy Serkis) is a closed loop of rose-tinted memories. Similarly constrained Mr. Garfield smiles broadly through episodes of near-suffocation and bloody sputum while Ms. Foy embodies the buck-up-and-carry-on mentality that William Nicholson��s screenplay demands."

which he wrote and directed is a particular and familiar one. The resonances begin with its title. ���The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)�� takes a literary angle that indirectly suggests The New Yorker J. D. Salinger and to some extent Woody Allen. Mr. Baumbach sticks with the short-story conceit throughout but he uses it as both a guiding principle and a means to surprise." it becomes evident that he doesn��t want it to end. This compels him to end it several more times than he needs to. My fondness for the characters had become such that I really did not mind." Harold immediately establishes himself as a less-than-great patriarch when his son and granddaughter arrive for a visit ��� Eliza just for a night as she��s headed off to Bard; Danny for longer as he��s just separated from his wife. Played with spectacularly virtuosic timing and emotional misdirection by Dustin Hoffman Harold is a sculptor feeling unappreciated late in life. This is a state he can��t help commenting on repeatedly talking over everyone around him: Danny Eliza; his current wife and the world��s worst cook Maureen (Emma Thompson); his withdrawn daughter Jean (Elizabeth Marvel); and later his other son Matthew (Ben Stiller) a successful business manager in Los Angeles whose own reluctant visit is extended by a series of mishaps." and they do work it out mostly hilariously. The Meyerowitzes are paragons of a specifically Manhattan-style liberal tolerance: The scene in which Danny and his sister and father react with complete nonchalance to Eliza��s first student film a self-starring quasi-pornographic fantasia about a superhero named ���Pagina-Man �� is likely to be cited in a good number of culture-conservative think pieces this season." the first line of the first story appears: ���Danny Meyerowitz was trying to park.�� The movie cuts to a medium close-up of a mustachioed Adam Sandler at a steering wheel looking back over his shoulder and screaming his head off." and all of them seethe with resentment. Almost everything that comes out of Harold��s mouth is a passive-aggressive accusation pitched with head-spinning atonal refinement as when on an unscheduled visit to the home of one of his ex-wives (Candice Bergen in a droll cameo) he makes a beeline to a bookshelf and says ���I think this is my copy of ���Buddenbrooks.����" but once Danny pulls out of the impossible space and tools around downtown Manhattan a different side of the character appears. His daughter Eliza (Grace Van Patten) has been peppering their parking adventure with some dietary advice for her father which he shrugs off with good humor. When ���Head to Toe �� a 1987 hit by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam comes on the car��s stereo Danny and Eliza exchange warm reminiscences while singing along. While he may be prone to parking rage (as who isn��t but as it happens he gets mad about lots of other stuff as well) Danny seems overall a great dad and a warm-hearted guy." Mr. Baumbach has achieved a near-perfect balance between engagement and discomfort. In ���The Squid and the Whale�� and ���Margot at the Wedding �� something drove him to depict family squabbles with a candor that approached cruelty. The anger in those movies and some of his others was bracing though a little more so than necessary. As boisterous and edgy as ���The Meyerowitz Stories�� gets it is a more mellow film and to my eyes and ears all the better for it." the acting is spectacular. Ms. Thompson is hilarious Ms. Marvel applies her customary note-perfect execution of character and Ms. Van Patten is what they call a find. And while Mr. Stiller��s Matthew is both reliably and appealingly neurotic it is Mr. Sandler who excels both riotously and poignantly."

Yet though traumatized by celebrity and the cruelty of his schoolmates he still desires only one thing."

You get the feeling that Bobby didn��t exactly sign up to be the de facto mayor of a makeshift village but he also clearly finds some satisfaction in managing the disorder that surrounds him. He��s gentle with the children even when they drive him crazy and disrupt his work and watches over them when nobody is looking. (In one of the film��s most gripping and sharply constructed scenes Bobby confronts a creepy predatory interloper who has been hanging around the motel��s playground.) His observant unassuming decency makes him to some degree the filmmaker��s surrogate." chasing dreams that seem at once fanciful and mundane: celebrity wealth a steady job a stable home. All of these things seem equally out of reach and tantalizingly close at hand and the same consumer economy that creates such precariousness also provides a steady stream of pleasure and diversion." anxiety and dread. We are well aware of the possible consequences and also of the grim circumstances that grant Moonee her freedom. She is in every sense a child at risk. We watch her Little Rascal antics increasingly sure that something terrible is going to happen." punishing its characters for their wildness and the audience for enjoying it. But the director who wrote the script with Chris Bergoch avoids the traps of condescension and prurience that ensnare too many well-meaning movies about poverty in America. Like Mr. Baker��s earlier features ���Starlet�� and ���Tangerine �� this movie insists on meeting people on both sides of the screen where they are on suspending judgment and extending compassion without abandoning its ethical grounding." �� Sean Baker��s risky and revelatory new film is the ability to tell its young heroine��s story from two perspectives at once. Moonee��s free-range existence looks like a lot of fun and she and her friends ��� mostly a boy named Scooty (Christopher Rivera) and sometimes a girl named Jancey (Valeria Cotto) ��� run wild with an exuberance that adult viewers can only envy.

They cook up pranks and follow their whims heedless of the consequences." and about the wishful thinking that can cloud our understanding of the world. Its final scenes are devastating and also marvelously ambiguous full of wonder fury and cleareyed self-criticism. No magic exists that can make the pain of reality disappear but we don��t know how to believe in anything else. This movie accomplishes something almost miraculous ��� two things actually. It casts a spell and tells the truth." the Magic Castle and its surroundings are a land of endless enchantment and nonstop adventure. Mischievous and fearless ��� heroically bratty; devilishly cute ��� Moonee may remind you of Eloise who tries the patience of the grown-ups at the Plaza Hotel in that immortal picture book. Their situations are different of course. Moonee��s mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) is not jetting around Europe leaving her daughter in the care of a stressed-out nanny.

The places will crumble and the faces will fade and the commemorative power of the images that JR and Ms. Varda make will provide a small and partial compensation for this gloomy inevitability. The world and its inhabitants are protean and surprising but also almost unbearably fragile and you feel the pull of gravity even in the film��s most lighthearted passages." Agn��s Varda is an artist with nothing to prove and everything to discover.

Ms. Varda��s modesty is evidence of her mastery just as her playful demeanor is the expression of a serious and demanding aesthetic commitment. Almost by stealth but also with cheerful forthrightness she communicates a rich and challenging array of feelings and ideas. As we contemplate those faces and places we are invited to reflect on the passage of time and the nature of memory on the mutability of friendship and the durability of art on the dignity of labor and the fate of the European working class." on factory workers and retirees on a group of longshoremen and their wives. Without pressing a political agenda or bringing up matters of ideology or identity they evoke a history of proud struggle and bitter defeat a chronicle etched in the stones of the villages and the lines on the faces." episodic structure of their journey gives ���Faces Places�� a deceptively casual air. It superficially resembles one of those ubiquitous cable-television shows in which a semi-celebrity bounces around the globe tasting the food and philosophizing with the locals. Ms. Varda and JR who is tall and stylish and never takes off his sunglasses are a charming pair. Their subjects are happy to chat and touched (if also sometimes a little embarrassed) to behold their likenesses turned into large-scale public art installations. The film works just fine as an anthology of amiable encounters and improvised collaborations." even though no one else could have made it. ���Faces Places�� is unforgettable not because of dramatic moments or arresting images but because once you have seen it you want to keep it with you like a talisman or a souvenir. Wherever you��re going it will surely come in handy." ���Faces Places �� finds Ms. Varda in the company of a younger comrade the 34-year-old French photographer and environmental artist known as JR. Together they set out on a series of meandering road trips through agricultural and industrial towns talking to people and taking their pictures.

There is something so poignant in the performance that it lifts this uncompromisingly savage picture above and beyond its vicious beat-downs. Bradley��s wife may be pregnant but it��s the actor who plays him who could experience new life." the clever horror-western ���Bone Tomahawk �� ���Brawl�� features violence that��s lurid and often ludicrous.

Yet Bradley stripped to a single galvanizing intention ��� to save his kidnapped wife (Jennifer Carpenter) and unborn daughter by killing a high-value inmate ��� never loses our sympathy. His fundamental decency has been so carefully established (even the detective questioning him knows this is no ordinary lug) that the medieval damage he inflicts with fists and feet seems if not always justifiable at least understandable." the movie stars a revelatory Vince Vaughn as Bradley Thomas a recovering alcoholic laid-off mechanic and newly expectant father. A charismatic bruiser with a baby-soft face and piledriver body Bradley favors a dry turn of phrase ��� when asked how he��s doing he responds ���South of OK north of cancer�� ��� and a placid demeanor. This last is blown when early on we watch him rip apart his wife��s car with his bare hands." but ���Brawl in Cell Block 99�� reaches some distance beyond simple prison-movie exploitation. For one thing the buildup is so grippingly patient that we��re more than halfway through before the titular battleground is reached. And for another this painstakingly paced thriller displays an intensity of purpose that makes it impossible to dismiss as well-executed trash." but perhaps for the first time Mr. Vaughn seems comfortable in his towering body. Bradley isn��t flyweight-nimble he��s a battering ram and the director wisely surrounds him with wickedly agile supporting players. Both Don Johnson and the great Udo Kier are memorably repulsive as a sadistic warden and a slimy go-between and Fred Melamed is chillingly hilarious as a persnickety prison intake officer." and the meticulous deconstruction of the vehicle reveals not only Bradley��s brute strength and boiling point but also his director��s death grip on style and tempo. And when Bradley��s temporary drug-running job with an old associate (Marc Blucas) goes south and he��s forced to navigate a series of increasingly atrocious confinements Mr. Zahler and his cinematographer Benji Bakshi never lose focus. Rejecting the jittery shooting style and sped-up splatter that distinguishes so many modern action movies ��� where mayhem flashes past too swiftly to register as a valid plot point or viable moral outcome ��� they plant their camera with such eerie stillness that every punch has traction."

�� says the hero of that movie when ��� at long last! ��� he shows up in this one. K finds Deckard the original Blade Runner (Mr. Ford as if I needed to tell you) in an abandoned Las Vegas casino surrounded by shimmering bottles of whiskey and primitive 3-D projections of Elvis and Frank Sinatra. Mr. Gosling suddenly overmatched in the masculine cool department acquits himself well enough and Mr. Ford does exactly what you expect him to do." which is a version of K��s own. The idea that synthetic humans harbor feelings desires and dreams ��� that they are mirrors of us that we are replicas of them ��� has long been a staple of speculative cinema. ���Blade Runner 2049�� does not wander as deep into this ontological thicket as say Steven Spielberg��s ���A.I.�� or Spike Jonze��s ���Her �� but like those movies it uses the conceit of the suffering cyborg as ethical and emotional ballast a spur to the audience��s curiosity as well as our compassion. A political theme also asserts itself: These replicants are an enslaved labor force; their exploitation is the fuel on which this civilization runs." merchandising empires and what we are now invited to call ���cinematic universes.�� ���Blade Runner �� Ridley Scott��s initially underrated 1982 adaptation of a novel by Philip K. Dick accomplished something more unusual. It sent tendrils of influence ��� pictorial conceptual and spiritual ��� into every corner of the culture and inspired a mystery cult." a fair amount to feel and even more to see. Mr. Villeneuve has conspired with the cinematographer Roger A. Deakins; the production designer Dennis Gassner; and the special effects team to create zones of strangeness that occasionally rise to the level of sublimity. The movies Mr. Villeneuve has directed ��� his recent English-language features include ���Sicario �� ���Prisoners�� and ���Arrival�� ��� are full of violence and psychological intensity but what distinguishes them from other high-end genre spectacles is an unnerving calm as if he were exploring and trying to synthesize the human and mechanical sides of his own sensibility." an academic subfield has blossomed isolating ���Blade Runner�� as one of the original symptoms of postmodernism a terminal and interminable disease of the mind. The film��s blend of curatorial nostalgia and dystopian prophecy captured a mood of self-conscious melancholy in its moment and set a tone of melancholy self-consciousness that has endured ever since. Maybe the real world never quite achieved the smoky neon-noir glow of Mr. Scott��s Los Angeles but the map of our collective dream world was permanently redrawn." K moves through his days with the unhurried shuffle and downcast baby blues of Ryan Gosling. This is impeccable casting. Mr. Gosling��s ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it ��� his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa ��� makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time. He is also in 2017 something close to what Harrison Ford was 35 years ago: the contemporary embodiment of Hollywood��s venerable ideal of masculine cool a guy whose toughness will turn out to be the protective shell encasing a tender soul." of lost possibility is even real? It might be nothing more than an artificially implanted memory." ���Blade Runner 2049�� stands in relation to ���Blade Runner�� almost exactly as K stands in relation to Deckard before the two meet: as a more docile less rebellious ���improvement �� tweaked and retrofitted to meet consumer demand. And the customers are likely to be satisfied. But now and then ��� when K and Deckard are knocking around the old gambling palace; when K visits an enigmatic mind-technician played by Carla Juri ��� you get an inkling that something else might have been possible. Something freer more romantic more heroic less determined by the corporate program." and the building-size video advertisements have evolved into seductive R-rated holograms. The titular profession ��� hunting down and ���retiring�� renegade members of the almost-human genetically engineered android species known as replicants ��� is practiced with the same brutal doggedness as in the old days." and the next chapter once something to be dreaded seems if anything overdue. ���Blade Runner 2049 �� directed by Denis Villeneuve from a script by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green tries both to honor the original and to slip free of its considerable shadow. That��s no easy feat and it��s worth noting right away that in narrow movie terms Mr. Villeneuve who also directed ���Arrival �� mostly succeeds. From the opening aerial shots of a thoroughly denatured agricultural landscape and the lethal confrontation that follows we know we are in the presence of a masterly visual tactician and a shrewd storyteller." the film invites doctrinal arguments and esoteric inquiries. One of my fondest memories as a father and a film critic is of an impromptu post-screening seminar with two 11-year-olds about occult meanings and hidden clues in the director��s cut. How do we know (if indeed we do know) that Harrison Ford is a replicant? What is the significance of the origami unicorn? Are Sean Young��s shoulder pads for real?" machines for the delivery of human emotion. The first ���Blade Runner�� approached this as a philosophical problem and an artistic challenge. Mr. Scott used imagery borrowed from old Hollywood German Expressionism and the nascent art of music video to create a dazzlingly artificial environment where authenticity was out of the question. Except of course that it was the question: How do we know what is real ourselves included?" more obedient type of replicant has been developed by a corporation led by a tech visionary played by Jared Leto. (His lieutenant Luv is played by Sylvia Hoeks a far more vivid and persuasively terrifying presence than the mannered Mr. Leto.) One of these models is our hero an L.A.P.D. employee known as K. (It��s an abbreviation of his serial number and also maybe an allusion to Franz Kafka��s avatar of modern alienation. That poor fellow��s full name was Josef K; when this K acquires a human pseudonym it��s Joe.)" at least as far as it relates to the story. The studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics not to reveal plot points. That��s fair enough but it��s also evidence of how imaginatively impoverished big-budget movies have become. Like any great movie Mr. Scott��s ���Blade Runner�� cannot be spoiled. It repays repeated viewing because its mysteries are too deep to be solved and don��t depend on the sequence of events. Mr. Villeneuve��s film by contrast is a carefully engineered narrative puzzle and its power dissipates as the pieces snap into place. As sumptuous and surprising as it is from one scene to the next it lacks the creative excess the intriguing opacity and the haunting residue of its predecessor." of course we must take that sensitivity on faith. K does his grim job thoroughly and without complaint showing the weary cynical patience of an old-time shamus. His commander (Robin Wright) is a human who believes that everything depends on policing the border between her kind and K��s. The whole point of ���Blade Runner �� though is that such boundaries are always blurred and porous. K comes home each night from work to the company of Joi (Ana de Armas) his devoted girlfriend who happens to be a commercially produced artificial intelligence application."

Intent on exploring life after death they temporarily put themselves into the uncharted territory of brain death (hence the title) with what were supposedly scary side effects relating to the wreckages of their past.

As Lucky bonds with a fellow World War II veteran and in one lovely scene slides into an impromptu song at a child��s birthday party the movie is more intent on measuring the weight of a life than contemplating death. So when our cranky hero a lifelong atheist declares that there is no soul it seems an extraordinary line to give an actor who spent his entire career proving otherwise." �� and then everything does.

The scandal encompassed a vast cast of characters that included President Ronald Reagan and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. A few show up in ���American Made�� either as fictionalized supporting characters or as themselves smiling and slinking in archival images." to keep us from looking or thinking too hard about the grotesquely corrupt circus parading onscreen. Mr. Cruise��s performance often seems similarly calculated. Barry likes to leap before he thinks: ���All this is legal?�� he asks scarcely pausing before plunging into the fray ��� and Mr. Cruise regularly widens his eyes in what seems to be an effort to convey Barry��s incredulity. It��s dissembling that is about as convincing as the Wolf leering in granny��s nightie. In truth this Barry is just another ugly American a happy hustler with a what-me-worry smile and a foot planted on another man��s throat." �� a breezily at times woozily rollicking Tom Cruise vehicle announces that it is ���based on a true lie�� ��� though the movie also asserts that it is based on a true story. But who��s quibbling? This is after all a Hollywood fantasy starring Mr. Cruise as Barry Seal a real-life smuggler. An enigma with multiple chins Mr. Seal was apparently known as El Gordo (the Fat Man) a name he may have picked up while working for a drug cartel the C.I.A. or the Drug Enforcement Administration." �� which spins like a top and has the visually beguiling somewhat jaundiced look of a faded old Polaroid. So it��s too bad that Mr. Liman himself didn��t burrow in here as a filmmaker. The real Mr. Seal has been both the main and side attraction in many articles books documentaries and hard-core propaganda flicks including some hinged on the Conspiratorial Industrial Complex which emerged during the Clinton presidency. Mr. Seal was also the subject of ���Doublecrossed �� a 1991 HBO docudrama starring Dennis Hopper (which is vaguely amusing if only because Mr. Hopper played a very different coke smuggler in ���Easy Rider��)." a pilot who racks up lots of miles while serving different masters. When the story opens he is flying for T.W.A. and bored out of his evidently simple rather dangerously restless mind. On the job he amuses himself by flipping a few switches jerking the controls and abruptly awakening sleeping passengers. His life takes a wild turn when a shady C.I.A. smiler Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) makes Barry an offer to help his country or something. Before long Barry is cozying up to Pablo Escobar and smuggling cocaine and AK-47s across the Americas. Every so often he drops into Panama to swap packages with that country��s strongman Manuel Noriega." who kick-started the ���Bourne�� spy franchise and directed ���Fair Game �� a fictional take on some real-world intrigue involving Valerie Plame Wilson a former C.I.A. officer and her husband Joseph C. Wilson IV a onetime diplomat. ���American Made �� in its self-amused tone and skittering rhythms though is closer to the thriller ���Edge of Tomorrow �� Mr. Liman and Mr. Cruise��s movie about a man ��� a wrong-guy wrong-place type ��� who dies to live another day only to die (repeat). Mr. Liman likes playing with Mr. Cruise��s persona say by messing up that famous smile and he clearly likes letting his star strut and glide." although it also provokes skepticism particularly in its attempt to portray Barry as a picaresque hero one of those rogues tumbling and swaggering from adventure to adventure in a world that��s more corrupt than they are. After all it asks how bad can Barry really be especially given the company he keeps? He doesn��t kill anyone not exactly and he��s nice to his wife Lucy (Sarah Wright Olsen) and their kids. A slightly downscale version of Margot Robbie��s character in ���The Wolf of Wall Street �� Lucy has a few tangy moments but she and the kids mostly enhance the visual design much like the period cars and costumes." ���American Made�� goes down easily especially if you don��t let the historical record with its real-world stakes bother you. Mr. Cruise��s brisk ingratiating performance ��� all smiles hard-charging physicality and beads of sweat ��� does a lot to soften the edges. But Mr. Liman doesn��t press Mr. Cruise to dig into the character and the actor mostly hurdles forward in a movie that never gets around to asking what makes Barry run and why. So Barry just runs and he flies and he flies some more delivering coke and accumulating suitcases of cash that he buries and stashes in closets. (It��s hard not to think that Mr. Cruise signed on to the movie so he could do all his own flying.)"

But Mark Felt though almost nobody knew back in the ��70s was undoubtedly instrumental in ending the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. The associate director of the F.B.I. at the time of the Watergate burglary Felt entered the annals of Nixon-era scandal as Deep Throat a pseudonym bestowed by the Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward." who didn��t much like the name identified himself as Mr. Woodward��s source in 2005.

His face as sharp as the blade of a hatchet his brow creased with his weariness and his eyes ablaze with indignation Mr. Neeson is a mighty presence on a small cramped stage." a history lesson that won��t help you on the test. It is possible to savor the crags and shadows of Mr. Neeson��s performance without quite grasping why Mr. Landesman thinks the story is worthy of such somber serious and sustained attention. Both the internal politics of the F.B.I. in the aftermath of J. Edgar Hoover��s death and the larger political and social dramas of the late ��60s and early ��70s are invoked but neither the national nor the institutional stakes are illuminated with sufficient clarity or force." the movie can be a tough slog. The main conflict is between Felt and his new boss L. Patrick Gray (Marton Csokas) who Felt comes to believe is functioning as Nixon��s mole in the F.B.I. and who also wants to limit the bureau��s Watergate inquiries. (Gray is also the man who took the job Felt thought should have been his and wounded pride may be among his motives.) Meanwhile on the home front Felt and his long-suffering heavy-drinking wife Audrey (Diane Lane) worry about their daughter who has vanished into the mists of the counterculture. There is a potentially interesting tension between Felt��s professional duties and his personal life that never fully takes shape." a career F.B.I. man with silver hair and a reputation for righteousness takes up the thankless task of investigating the suspected wrongdoing and attendant cover-up.

Since Addie and Louis are already sleeping together there��s no need to rush into anything." respectable people of a kind who usually show up in movies to be mocked or sentimentalized. The disappointments and satisfactions they have lived through are etched on their faces which are also the faces of two very famous movie stars ��� Jane Fonda and Robert Redford. Viewers with long memories or heavy TCM habits will recall that 50 years ago they starred as New York newlyweds in ���Barefoot in the Park.�� In 1979 they reunited with a touch more denim in ���The Electric Horseman.�� The intervening decades have hardly diminished their charm or their skill and part of the pleasure of this film directed by Ritesh Batra (���The Lunchbox��) lies in the rediscovery of what wonderful actors they can be and how good they are together." as soft and sweet as the flesh of a marshmallow ���Our Souls at Night�� chronicles the blossoming of a December-December romance between two neighbors in the fictional prairie town of Holt Colo. It begins not with a spark of passion but with a sensible if unusual proposal. Addie Moore shows up at Louis Waters��s house and asks if he will sleep with her. Addie doesn��t mean she wants to have sex with Louis.

Louis startled by the idea agrees to think about it." for his part doesn��t mind his solitude. Mr. Redford who barely uttered a word in ���All Is Lost �� at first seems prepared to match that feat here interrupting what seem like monthlong pauses to mutter sigh and occasionally deliver a complete sentence. He is one of the great minimalists of American cinema an actor who can dazzle you by opening the tiniest window onto a character��s inner life. When Louis meets Addie��s young grandson Jamie (the remarkable Iain Armitage seen on television in ���Big Little Lies�� and ���Young Sheldon��) the encounter awakens a long-dormant paternal instinct and also a streak of boyishness." �� adapted (by Scott Neustadter and Michael H.

When Addie and Louis��s grown-up children show up ��� played by Matthias Schoenaerts and Judy Greer ��� they drag in some bulky baggage. Each family has a painful event in its past and each child represents a textbook drawing of the consequences of that pain rather than a fully embodied credibly suffering human being." the stars have humanity to spare and very little left to prove. With her careful diction and a bearing that conveys starchiness and sensuality in perfect improbable balance Ms. Fonda turns middle-class maturity into a bewitching form of charisma. Addie��s approach to Louis a man she has never known that well is driven less by neediness than by a rational understanding of what she needs. She needs to be less alone."

and set Billie Jean��s bedroom sighs off against Bobby��s heat-seeking braggadocio. There��s a lot to follow and a great deal to look at including an atmospherically embellished past that turns the movie into a veritable wayback machine of amusing and amusingly unfortunate colors and choices. (The director of photography is Linus Sandgren; the production designer is Judy Becker.) There are plaid jackets and flirty minis sideburns and shags harvest-gold drapes and rooms perilously fogged in by cigarette smoke." speaking feminist truth to power: ���It��s when we want a little bit of what you��ve got �� she says ���that��s what you can��t stand.�� It��s a solid gotcha moment but the reason it works as well as it does is its low-key realism which underscores the absolute ordinariness of the sexism she��s calling out. Ms. Stone handles the scene exactly right letting you see the tremor of indignation while keeping righteousness in view yet also in check. She��s unsurprisingly good and often moving although the best thing about the performance is that Ms. Stone hasn��t been asked to play the girl who seduces us with big eyes and a smile. Billie Jean is a woman and that��s a win." cramming characters and information into Billie Jean and Bobby��s separate realities. Billie Jean��s is livelier more engaging partly because there��s more at stake and because she��s surrounded by chummy pleasurably prickly women like Rosie Casals (Natalie Morales) and Gladys Heldman (a tangy Sarah Silverman) the founder of Tennis World magazine. Together with seven other top female players these three form a feminist revolt called the Virginia Slims tour a women��s pro circuit that sets out to combat the gross inequalities that defined professional (open) tennis since its advent in 1968." �� a glib enjoyable fictionalization of the 1973 exhibition tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. She was 29 and one of the top female tennis players in the world. He was 55 and had been a world champion before she was born. She was a feminist symbol and the first female athlete to win more than $100 000 in a single year; he was a self-avowed male chauvinist pig who liked to gamble big. It was a man vs. woman match made for maximum public-relations gimmickry but also a deadly serious referendum on equality on and off the court." sporty feminists stake their rightful claim ��� holding press conferences drumming up support winning and winning some more ��� a rather dark clubbier male world comes into view. A gambler Bobby watches Billie Jean on TV but hangs with masters of the universe male cigar chompers and scotch swirlers who think nothing of betting away a Rolls-Royce. It looks like a lethal bore as does Bobby��s home where he plays with his young son under a conspicuously large and looming portrait of his wife. By the time Bobby is challenging Billie Jean to play it almost seems as if he were willing himself into the arms ��� or at least company ��� of this other woman." but ���Battle of the Sexes�� manages it mostly by skipping along its handsome surfaces. The film repeatedly announces that there��s a lot at stake here but without much urgency or sting. Bobby��s sexist pronouncements are outrageous but his stunts are so absurd and self-serving that they��re hard to take seriously. And while Mr. Carell bounces and sags persuasively the characterization is finally so soft that Bobby comes off as more needy and pathetic than threatening. The better foil and villain is a tennis promoter Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman) one of those men who never bothers to hide his contempt for women." which ���Battle of the Sexes�� gets. It was also entertainment which is where the movie really excels. Nice and easy it sets the players and early 1970s scene with Billie Jean (Emma Stone) already making history and Bobby (Steve Carell) largely sidelined. She��s making waves as a player and as a champion of women��s rights including equal pay and earning plaudits from the likes of President Nixon. Bobby seems to be living off his indulgent wealthy wife (Elisabeth Shue) a frozen smiler right out of Stepford and spending time on idle in a fancy office. Mostly Billie Jean is winning while Bobby is keeping boredom at bay." partly because Billie Jean initially turns Bobby down. So instead he takes on Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee) the Australian champion who becomes the movie��s female heavy. (The real Ms. Court has played that role off screen for her views on same-sex marriage and homosexuality which she��s branded ���a lust for the flesh.��) In a well-publicized faceoff soon called the Mother��s Day Massacre Bobby defeats Margaret a loss that Billie Jean feels she needs to correct. It��s game on though with complications including Billie Jean��s revelatory attraction to another woman a hairdresser Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough)."

���The Force�� offers a look at a police department explicitly as it is embodied by individuals and operates as an institution. There are times especially when the other meanings of ���force�� emerge ��� and power compulsion and violence become nakedly present ��� that you wish that Mr. Nicks would have stayed longer so he could dig deeper into related issues including segregation and racism. He tends to cycle through historical markers fairly fast as when he shows archival images of the group originally and pointedly called the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense which started in Oakland in 1966 partly in response to police brutality." �� there��s a moment when Sean Whent the Oakland chief of police faces a tough critic: the public. It��s 2015 and he��s talking about the police response to calls. He admits the police are not providing the level of service they should but adds that they��re trying their best. When a robbery victim says their best isn��t good enough he apologizes. ���We need to do a better job no doubt and we are trying to do a better job.�� By the end of the movie it seems clear that he didn��t apologize enough." though the director Peter Nicks does periodically pull back to look at the bigger messy picture. For the most part he keeps his focus trained on events as they transpire during the two often turbulent years that he roots around the department. He rides with officers follows them onto the streets and straight into assorted testy conflagrations. He sits in on meetings some with officers and others with politicians recording silences and outbursts moments of frustration and complaint. Repeatedly he sets the efforts of individual cops against larger departmental issues." the fact that Mr. Nicks embedded with the Oakland police (rather than say with activists) means it emphasizes reform as a goal and a possibility. The movie may offer an incriminatory catalog of organizational failure but it also repeatedly shows people trying to make the system work. A sobering alternative view surfaces late when Cat Brooks with the Anti Police-Terror Group says ���We do not believe that police departments can actually be reformed.�� For these activists a triage solution like a civilian review board makes sense even as other questions ��� is a police force necessary? ��� linger." ���The Force�� is an account of a big-city police department in crisis. In some ways it is a bleakly familiar story of a troubled department struggling ��� and failing and struggling ��� to right its wrongs. In 2003 Oakland and its police settled a civil-rights lawsuit and began trying to implement reforms (like improved officer training) and adhere to fundamentals or what the city attorney called the department��s ���commitment to constitutional policing.�� By 2014 the year the documentary opens the department was into its second decade of federal oversight and these basic goals remained stubbornly elusive." it isn��t all that evident onscreen. Certainly the documentary doesn��t come off as either for or against the police in general terms or in respect to the Oakland force. And while personalities emerge Mr. Nicks doesn��t elevate heroes or call out villains. Instead he makes room for various voices from community organizers to protesters with Black Lives Matter signs to a sober young officer whose experiences underscore how tough and at times harrowing being a street cop can be. These voices are fractious cacophonous and rarely in sync." Mr. Nicks largely takes an observational approach to ���The Force �� the kind that turns the camera into a persistent bystander. This particular bystander tends to have a fairly short attention span and rarely stays in one place for long perhaps because Mr. Nicks crams years of material into a 93-minute film. He also incorporates a bit of found material including old news reports as well as a few extremely disturbing lethal encounters taken from police body cams. Every so often he identifies a speaker with onscreen text or adds a time stamp; occasionally he slides in some propulsive electronic beats."

Then ���Stronger�� rushes through what screenwriting gurus call the ���redemptive arc �� with little concern for just how its lead character makes the life changes that enable him to face his responsibilities. And in that respect it brings the viewer up short." a resident of Chelmsford Mass. who lost both his legs above the knee in the terrorist bombings of the Boston Marathon in 2013." based on Mr. Bauman��s autobiography begins with a depiction of him as a relatively amiable screw-up.

you are left wondering just how far Mr. Aronofsky will go with it. The answer is all the way and then some ��� from Genesis to Revelation and back again.

Holy Eucharist Batman!" lonely and confused especially when her hubby starts bringing home guests. ���Who are these people?�� she asks him. She never receives an adequate answer ��� they are big fans of the poet��s work though ��� and for a while her bewilderment is ours as well. But we at least are in a position to analyze the abundantly available clues and figure out who everybody is the poet and his lady included. Or if not quite who they are then at least what they represent. Because though this extravagant conversation piece of a movie written and directed by Darren Aronofsky feints toward psychological thriller territory and spends a delicious half-hour or so in the realm of domestic farce it plants its flag defiantly on the wind-swept peak of religious (and ecological) allegory." rather than elements of its story? Ordinarily such questions would be absurd but Mr. Aronofsky ingeniously braids his movie��s hermeneutic structure into its plot making it hard to say what it��s about without revealing what happens. All of the suspense and most of the fun in ���Mother!�� ��� and don��t listen to anyone who natters on about how intense or disturbing it is; it��s a hoot! ��� has to do with the elaboration and execution of a central idea." oddly-shaped Victorian house in the middle of a tree-ringed meadow ��� less a McMansion than a perennial fixer-upper. The work of home improvement of literal homemaking you might say falls to the young wife. Her husband who has been around longer than she has is absorbed in his work. He��s a poet and the torment of creation distracts him from her needs at times rendering him all but oblivious to her presence. Neither partner is given a name. They are played by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. The movie is called ���Mother!�� The first line of dialogue is ���Baby?��" pictorially overloaded environment with a sense of human reality ��� with flesh and blood and feeling. Mr. Bardem alpha male and omega man is the kind of actor who can endow an abstraction with gravity and tenderness. (He did pretty much that in ���No Country for Old Men.��) The enigmatic nature of his character in ���Mother!�� allows him to relax to be playful and charismatic and to disappear. Mr. Harris and especially Ms. Pfeiffer bring a jolt of shtick and a whisper of camp qualities that you may miss terribly when they depart." ���Mother!�� made me laugh harder and more frequently than just about any other movie I��ve seen this year. I don��t say this derisively. Mr. Aronofsky��s visual wit and dexterous disciplined camera movements create frissons of comic terror. His gift for escalation ��� evident in the marvelous crescendo of frenzied action that occupies most of the movie��s second half ��� may be unmatched in his generation of filmmakers."

At a certain point ��� it will vary according to your Sunday school attendance or what you remember from freshman English ��� you will find yourself in possession of the key to the analogical storage room where the Real Meaning resides.

But then sometime between the first violent death and the collapse of the kitchen sink you realize that something else is going on." for her part bears an impossible burden. In dramatic terms she is a passive reactive protagonist a cipher and in the strict sense of the word an icon.

Mr. Aronofsky and his usual cinematographer Matthew Libatique conduct a master class in light shadow and Renaissance art. Ms. Lawrence glows like an Italian Madonna while the deep lines in Mr. Bardem��s face and the sorrowful cast of his eyes suggest El Greco. The infernal chaos of the climactic sequences are pure Hieronymus Bosch updated for the age of Kristen Wiig and automatic weaponry." instead is extravagant sensation and churning intellectual energy. Mr. Aronofsky is a virtuoso of mood and timing a devoted student of form and technique straining to be a credible visionary. But as wild and provocative as his images can be there is something missing ��� an element of strangeness of difficulty of the kind of inspiration that overrides mere cleverness." but maybe what we need is a new Blake Edwards. At a time when film comedy is mostly a verbal and psychical affair ��� the domain of writers and clowns ��� there is a dearth of funny directors with Mr. Aronofsky��s sophisticated chops. If he didn��t take himself so seriously he could be a great comic filmmaker. But maybe ���Mother!�� proves that he already is."

1911. More than 50 000 souls are said to have flowed through its marble grandeur inaugurating what has been an intimate mutually sustaining union between the public and its library. In his magnificent new documentary ���Ex Libris: The New York Public Library �� Frederick Wiseman takes his camera into those same halls as well as into more humble city branches. He sweeps into atriums and down corridors pauses in reading and meeting rooms and lays bare this complex glorious organism that is the democratic ideal incarnate." Mr. Wiseman doesn��t overtly address the Library��s Central Library Plan a controversial proposal initiated in 2008 that would have involved a radical redesign and new focus ��� away from research to circulation ��� for the main branch. Among other goals the library was seeking to make its flagship more public friendly a fuzzy term that can serve as a fig leaf for anti-intellectualism. Alarmed that the library was discarding its mission scholars composed letters that the likes of Salman Rushdie signed and committees and lawsuits ensued. The expensive plan was scuttled in 2014." and Mr. Wiseman has said that he visited about a dozen during the 12 weeks in 2015 that he shot this movie. Again and again though he returns to the main branch now formally called the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. A private equity executive Mr. Schwarzman donated $100 million to the New York Public Library in 2008 effectively buying the right to have his name on the main branch alongside quotations from immortals like Jorge Luis Borges and Thomas Jefferson. Big money is a thread running through the movie including in meetings with Anthony W. Marx the president of the library and other senior staff members." which gathers details ranging from the prosaic to the peculiar for his evolving mosaiclike picture. ���The Gutenberg bible is temporarily unavailable for viewing �� says a librarian working on the telephone research desk. ���A unicorn is actually an imaginary animal �� says another with a poker face and blissful patience. Sometimes the speakers are downright glittering: Patti Smith holds forth on one occasion and on another Elvis Costello introduces a charming video clip of his father a musician Ross McManus singing the progressive anthem ���If I Had a Hammer.�� (���I��d hammer out the love between my brothers and my sisters/All over this land.��)" Mr. Wiseman��s great subject has been institutions places that he once loosely defined as having ���certain kinds of geographical limitations and where at least some of the people have well-established roles.�� He��s particularly sensitive to the ebb and flow of humans inside these places and unsurprisingly given this documentary��s focus he seems especially attentive here to the sounds of that flow. (As usual Mr. Wiseman recorded the movie��s sound and is its editor.) In one scene the poet Yusef Komunyakaa��s words bounce off hard walls; elsewhere only the rustling of turning manuscript pages disturbs a room��s tranquillity." including the overarching question of the library��s mission. Throughout ���Ex Libris�� both senior staff members and branch librarians speak about serving the public service that has long extended beyond checking out physical books. In scene after scene you are reminded that libraries serve as study centers neighborhood hubs babysitters and homeless shelters. They offer lectures and concerts but also provide immigrant services job fairs and internet service including through a program that lets users without home access borrow mobile hot spots." the practical and the philosophical meet head on in ���Ex Libris�� as discussions about budget concerns and the public good swirl amid orders for building renovations and larger questions about the digital divide. Places come into view as do people who read deliberate and declaim uptown and down largely in Manhattan though also in the Bronx. (Mr. Wiseman isn��t in the information business so it seems worth mentioning that there are three separate library systems in the city including the Queens Library and the Brooklyn Public Library.)" Utopian mission in a documentary that builds with intellectual force and deep emotion as it shows again and again citizens ��� interested questioning seeking ��� joining together to listen to one another and to learn from one another. In ���Ex Libris �� democracy is alive and in the hands of a forceful advocate and brilliant filmmaker which helps make this one of the greatest movies of Mr. Wiseman��s extraordinary career and one of his most thrilling." Mr. Wiseman incessantly shifts in ���Ex Libris�� between quiet and noise macro and micro patrons and administrators. A shot of the main branch��s exterior accompanied by the city��s cacophonous din is answered by a shot of its hushed and vaulted entranceway. With rigor and clarity Mr. Wiseman who refrains from using voice-over situates you in specific locations using street signs (Library Way and Fifth Avenue) as well as the names of buildings and branches like that of the tiny Macomb��s Bridge Library at Harlem River Houses. Over time as he skips across New York the branches start to fit together as building blocks of the larger institution."

Dayveon gets a more rude awakening to gang life when he covers up a license plate to help his comrades flee a robbery." the movie hints at several possible futures for Dayveon: a stable life with his family; afternoons skipping rocks with a friend (Kordell Johnson) who is also a new gang member; more robberies. But the diffuse filmmaking style muffles the story��s power." �� the debut feature of Amman Abbasi ticks several boxes on the checklist of independent film affectations: the casting of nonprofessionals the blending of fiction and documentary elements a glancing editing style that is either lyrical or vague depending on your point of view. The movie bears a superficial resemblance visually and in its coming-of-age narrative to ���George Washington�� (directed by David Gordon Green an executive producer here) and ���Moonlight �� but it never finds the right balance between the suggestive and the concrete."

Sometimes the effort here is more admirable than exciting." no matter how slight is worth something."

From a hunt in Namibia to a safari lodge in South Africa from an animal control program in Zimbabwe to a Las Vegas convention hall the narrative becomes only more complex and confounding.

Moral indifference is an easy path and it leads to other graver sins including cruelty and dishonesty. But the harder road of decency has its own traps and byways as a young doctor named Jenny Davin discovers." the film allows her what at first seems to be a trivial lapse.

Based on the Teri Woods novel of the same name the hustlers of ���True to the Game�� are trapped in a world of twists and treachery. But though Ms. Woods��s novel was a resonant entry in the crime genre when it came out nearly 20 years ago this adaptation lacks the vision to find a fresh angle on her story. It��s all too easy to guess which characters will be marked for tragedy and which characters will learn from their loss." the familiarity of the crime genre can provide an opportunity for a filmmaker to flex their point of view but the direction by Preston A. Whitmore II seems hampered by either a lack of resources or a lack of interest. The camera lingers on expensive cars but club scenes appear threadbare.

The three shack up in Alice��s guesthouse and soon they��re all one smiley family which might be odd because they��re strangers and she has young daughters ��� except that this isn��t reality it��s a bubble." who sail from festival hype to Hollywood evoke the fairy-tale trajectories of directors like Colin Trevorrow who went from making a tiny movie to ���Jurassic World.�� Ms. Meyers-Shyer has taken a parallel path one followed by members of the Coppola clan. Ms. Meyers helped produce ���Home Again�� and her former husband and filmmaking partner Charles Shyer served as their daughter��s second unit director. Alice��s dead father was a director too. Canisters of film sit no doubt decaying in a sun-filled room the same one in which his Oscar ��� the apotheosis of this movie��s aspirational thinking ��� stands as a shining testament to a daughter��s love and her picture��s absurdity." ���Home Again �� Hallie Meyers-Shyer Nancy Meyers��s daughter has made a shabby copy of a Nancy Meyers romantic comedy. If you��ve watched any of Ms. Meyers��s movies the resemblance between influence and imitation will be readily apparent. To wit: A star (Reese Witherspoon) plays a would-be charmer (here called Alice) whose neuroses are as fabulously customized as her kitchen. She��s what the brand-conscious call a creative and while she works (a bit) she spends much of her time on man troubles. Her life is as fluffed as a throw pillow and so drained of realism it is best described as a lifestyle which can make for a killer aspirational fantasy at least in Nancy Meyers��s hands." �� on the other hand is wholly resistible partly because it can��t fulfill the promise of that aspirational fantasy either on a craft level or in terms of its emotional and psychological portraiture. The problems begin with the script or perhaps just with the insulting idea that Alice would be crying buckets into a mirror because she��s turning 40 on the day the story opens. Yes she is newly separated from her music-industry husband (Michael Sheen) who likes to take calls from his New York office with its sweeping view. Alice doesn��t seem too bent out of shape by the separation. She��s busy building a new career as an interior decorator and has moved with her two daughters into her childhood home which she has redecorated to look like something out of a lower-budget Nancy Meyers movie."

Perhaps inevitably Mr. Cresti a charismatic figure with a gray beard and a leonine halo of hair becomes the focal point as he struggles to turn the town��s latest collective concerns into its next big show." �� Jeff Malmberg and Chris Shellen stay a while. Their most obvious subject is the annual production that Monticchiello townspeople have mounted since the 1960s when some could remember the Fascist occupation firsthand. In the early years the residents put on pageants that at least from the modest documentation in the movie seem like elaborations on other regional events like the centuries-old horse race called the Palio in nearby Siena. At some point the Monticchiello residents turned to the more immediate past revisiting for instance the trauma of the war and the day Nazis lined the villagers up threatening to shoot them all." warming hands and souls over coffee; others write confessions. For decades the residents of the tiny Tuscan town of Monticchiello have turned their lives into theater. Each year they gather to discuss art and their world until they land on a topic that reflects their most recent urgent concerns. Word by word they push and pull challenging one another as they shape a production. All the world��s a stage but in Monticchiello that truism is movingly real especially because these days its aging resident-players have more exits than entrances." almost insulting to call ���Spettacolo�� charming even if the movie is often delightful. In guidebooks charm tends to be a commercial marker a signifier for an imaginary easily salable and consumable notion of authenticity. Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen understand the allure of that imaginary world; they were after all on vacation when they discovered Monticchiello and their documentary is itself often lovely. Yet they remind you that people are not attractions and their homes are not museums even if the global economy its casual tourists and rich speculators are determined to prove otherwise." the economy has fueled the spettacolo which the movie��s notes define as ���performance spectacle or play.�� That was certainly the case in 2012 when the bulk of the movie was shot over a period of six months. In interviews Mr. Malmberg has said that he and Ms. Shellen happened on Monticchiello while on a vacation. (Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen who are married share directing credit; he shot and edited the documentary and she recorded sound.) They were ambling around rather like the day trippers in the documentary when they accidentally came across Andrea Cresti an artist who turned out to be theater��s longtime director as well as the portal into this story." it becomes evident that the filmmakers are less interested in the final play than in its production in its process and multiple meanings. Nothing if not discreet (and sly) Mr. Malmberg and Ms. Shellen have shaped much of their material into four chapters that are named for the seasons. Each chapter is accompanied by ah-and-ooh beauty shots of the region yet as winter gives way to spring and brown hills turn green the day-to-day lives of the townspeople create a gentle insistent critique of these seasonal postcards. Much like the town��s annual production the movie is telling its own story dialectically." Monticchiello tends to be one of those towns that in English-language guidebooks rates a line or two in between chapters on Florence and Venice. One such book mentions the town��s ���Teatro Povero (a folk theater production)��; another notes its ���forbidding walls�� and ���medieval past �� assuring readers that it��s ���well worth exploring�� even if over all ���there is nothing much in the way of sights.�� These mercenary assessments are meant of course for harried hurried travelers including those of us lucky enough to shape a few precious days into something we call vacation."

Melva (Edwina Findley Dickerson) a single mother has a desk job but pours much of her energy into the care of her two children particularly a son she can scarcely control and whose outbursts slip into frightening violence." which owes more to the classic art film than to the commercial mainstream can be frustrating. At times his visual style announces itself too overtly; and he tends to be too withholding as if he were concerned about being obvious or falling into melodrama. He parses out information about his characters incrementally in scenes that come across less like moments from fully realized lives and more like flashcards: a man walking amid debris to imply alienation and abjection. The results occasionally feel coy but each time the movie edges into mannerism Mr. Harewood and Ms. Dickerson pull you close enough to make it hurt." in shots of hands raised in prayer in images of men and women isolated in the frame. The movie��s realism owes much to the lived-in locations and its two excellent leads who fill in the gaps with nuanced emotional texture; the script doesn��t tell you much about who these people are but the actors do. Such is the case with Mr. Harewood whose rigorously restrained physical performance ��� a heavily bowed head arms tightly crossed over his chest ��� conveys a desperate attempt at self-control and an unspoken burden that seems as if it should break a man." Melva is still open to the world ��� her children it��s suggested are one reason ��� which makes her especially poignant. She��s a single mother and struggling but she isn��t a casualty or a case file: She goes out with girlfriends tends to her children. Yet if she isn��t broken when the movie opens she has begun to buckle. Ms. Dickerson draws you to her slowly and inevitably with hopeful smiles glints of panic and fear; her tears dribble and then cascade but are always earned. Like Mr. Harewood (from TV��s ���Homeland��) Ms. Dickerson (���The Wire��) is one of a legion of very fine performers working in television who deserve to be in more movies." as the Pentecostal worshipers echo the resounding ministering. Soon along with a few other congregants Abe forms a prayer circle with the intention of healing Melva��s son Benny (RaJay Chandler). Together the congregants pray over Benny who��s lain supine on the altar on a simple cloth.

Ms. Hittman is also assured enough to know it can��t be easily resolved." Frankie hangs out with macho aimless potheads in and around the Coney Island boardwalk.

And that��s the problem: Perhaps stifled by the cultural and commercial clout of its source material (a multimedia juggernaut of books movies television shows and a stage musical) ���Death Note�� feels rushed and constricted.

That said Mr. Wingard��s eye for a stylish image hasn��t dimmed. Working with the cinematographer David Tattersall he concocts sequences that tilt and drift awash in neon and a soundtrack that evokes a woozy winking romanticism.

What they celebrate above all is the combination of craft planning and problem-solving ingenuity that can turn a job of work into a work of art. They are in other words the quintessential movie movies reflecting the collaborative challenges and logistical triumphs of the production cycle." flaunting borrowed attitudes and showy retrofitted styles Mr. Soderbergh revels in squareness and in a loose self-confidence that disguises its mastery. ���Logan Lucky�� is a terrific movie. That��s a matter of skill and maybe also of luck. But mostly it��s a matter of generosity." letting the story take care of itself while the audience enjoys the sometimes funny sometimes fractious sometimes wistful pleasure of the characters�� company. By the time you encounter Hilary Swank��s F.B.I. agent or figure out that the obnoxious British energy-drink mogul who is the only truly villainous character is Seth MacFarlane you feel like you��re a family-reunion crasher who stuck around long enough to get promoted to second cousin." who plays the song for his young daughter Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie) while they work on his pickup truck knows that its authenticity is questionable. Two of the credited writers he says had probably never even been to West Virginia when they hymned the beauty of its valleys and rivers. (���Logan Lucky �� it should probably be pointed out was shot mostly in Georgia.) But Jimmy also knows that even pop-culture artifice can carry a spore of genuine sentiment and Mr. Soderbergh shows a similar faith in the impure products of America. A student of movie traditions high and low he draws his inspiration here less from the gritty downbeat realism of ��70s New Hollywood than from that decade��s good-time populist genre hybrids. If the ���Oceans�� series represented his updating of Kennedy-era Rat Pack swagger ���Logan Lucky�� revives the irreverent hell-raising outlaw vibe of ���Smokey and the Bandit.��" and an antidote to the effects of class. In a land of winners and losers where life is acknowledged to be unfair and positive thinking is all-powerful we often find fault (or solace) not in our social structures but in our stars." and about one-tenth as vain. Since his early screen appearances (in ���Step Up�� and ���A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints��) it��s been evident that he is a singularly charismatic performer but by now it should be clear that he��s also a great actor. I think his appeal has less to do with any supposed Everyman quality (though every man can dream of course) than with an uncanny ability to convey irony and sincerity in the same gesture to balance his effortless magnetism with unforced modesty." �� Steven Soderbergh��s gravity-defying ridiculously entertaining new film ��� one that ends a blessedly brief retirement from big-screen directing ��� concerns itself with a desperate attempt to even the odds. It��s a caper movie a modern-day Robin Hood tale organized around an elaborate improbable but curiously plausible heist. A gang that includes a wounded veteran an unemployed former coal miner a hairdresser and other motley members of the noncoastal nonelite conspires to knock over a Nascar race sponsored by Coca-Cola. The event sucks a lot of cash from people like them and the thieves quite literally set out to suck it right back up." in ���Erin Brockovich�� and ���The Girlfriend Experience �� in ���Bubble�� and of course in ���Magic Mike�� ��� is atmospheric rather than programmatic. Nobody in ���Logan Lucky�� utters a political word but the setting carries a heavy obvious charge of political significance all the same. The Logans in question are proud hard-pressed residents of West Virginia a state that in the real world punches far above its demographic weight in partisan and symbolic importance. Their land is beautiful and their water is contaminated. The film��s anthem is John Denver��s ���Take Me Home Country Roads �� a hillbilly elegy if ever there was one." a good heist movie can settle into a sweet spot where reality and fantasy converge. This one��s narrative engine hums along nicely occasionally accelerating into farce usually when Mr. Craig shows up sporting neck tattoos spiky bleached hair and an accent that sounds like the cause or the result of a badly sprained tongue. (The dialects are all over the map but let��s not get too hung up on authenticity.)" once a high school football star has not quite resigned himself to life on the short end of the stick. Laid off from a construction job in North Carolina he returns home to discover that his ex-wife (Katie Holmes) and her car-dealer husband (David Denman) are planning to move out of West Virginia with Sadie. Jimmy��s brother Clyde (Adam Driver) a bartender who lost a hand in Iraq thinks the family is cursed.

But that revelation is really just confirmation of Mr. Bonello��s shallow cynicism his facile conviction that he has built a trap for the audience��s conscience rather than a useless self-consuming artifact. When the ruthless faceless power of the state finally asserts itself what is meant to be a shocking climax merits little more than a nod and a shrug. What took so long? There��s nothing political about that response: Like ���Nocturama �� it��s nothing but an expression of aesthetic ennui." sending dramatic lethal messages to enemies and sympathizers alike. For Mr. Bonello��s cadre of good-looking militants deeds are more like marketing slogans expressions of a free-floating aesthetic of tedium and mild stimulation." whose previous films include ���House of Pleasures�� (a prurient peek behind the scenes at an early-20th-century bordello) and ���Saint Laurent�� (a salacious tour of ��70s couture) possesses cinematic skill and suavity to spare. The story told in ���Nocturama�� splits neatly into before and after with a few flashbacks thrown in for clarity and variety.

though mostly it��s a sweet and sometimes delightful melancholic story of a lonely man saved by imagination and love. That sounds like a bushel of cornball and might have devolved into pure ick if the director Dave McCary didn��t lead from the heart and wasn��t adept at navigating seemingly clashing tones. He hooks you early with an uneasily ha-ha strange opener in which James and two others ��� Jane Adams plays April while a warm wonderful Mark Hamill plays Ted ��� engage in ���Brigsby�� banter. Soon sirens are flashing and the movie darkens; a few beats later it brightens then swerves into silliness only to veer into seriousness." awkward reintroduction into the world or what some call adulthood. There��s the family he��s never met (Matt Walsh Michaela Watkins Ryan Simpkins); a friendly cop (Greg Kinnear); and a clueless therapist (Claire Danes). There are new buddies (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) who with smiles mood enhancers and some unpersuasive narrative nudging help usher James into the here and now. Yet James having been cut off from Brigsby World can��t quit the bear who��s seen every so often saving the day in some of the wittily conceptualized visually degraded television clips sprinkled throughout the movie. And really why should James turn off the love?" it��s no wonder. Who after all hasn��t taped a Marilyn Monroe poster on her college-dorm door or hung a really nice poster for the film ���Anatomy of a Murder�� on a wall? People have been surrounding themselves with objects of worship since time immemorial even if today��s fetish is more likely to be a Chewbacca collectible than a terra-cotta object. Sure in the age of global corporate media and cross-platform branding fandom is a cradle-to-grave commodity lifestyle from ���Star Wars�� onesies to superhero coffins. And yes this isn��t always cosplay; it��s a matter of life (and death)." well unbearable. It��s the story of a young man who after decades of being shut away from the world splashes down in it like a space alien. There are reasons for his re-entry though that��s getting ahead of the story which uses a queasy crime as a jumping-off point to spin a largely sweet often very funny fairy tale about the perils and the sustaining pleasures of obsessive fandom. Mostly it is an account of one man��s great mad love one that��s mocked tested and deemed near-pathological ��� a familiar plight for many superfans." currently cutting it up on ���Saturday Night Live �� manages the twists and tonal fluctuations in ���Brigsby Bear�� beautifully. (He wrote the story and shares screenwriting credit with Kevin Costello.) It��s no surprise that he can sustain and complicate a deadpan. But what makes the character work is the unconditional emotional seriousness that shapes the performance deepening each glance and gesture. Mr. McCary fills the movie with modest comic jolts from James��s shock of hair to the near-Lynchian cardboard surrealism of the ���Brigsby�� show. The biggest jolt though is how each laugh brings forth more feeling in a movie that flirts with tragedy but opts for joy." �� an amusingly weird live-action children��s television show that James (Kyle Mooney) has been faithfully watching since childhood. Now somewhere in his 20s James shows no sign of moving on. He doesn��t merely love the plucky heroic bear ��� as well as Brigsby��s adorable helpers the Smiles Sisters and his villainous foe the Sun Snatcher; James has absorbed the show its stories and ethos into his being. His walls are lined with images from it; his shelves are crammed with recordings of each episode and related paraphernalia. He can mouth old dialogue verbatim.

This distance adds to her mystery and it also makes the eruptions of violence more electric. As ���Mad Max: Fury Road�� confirmed she��s a natural warrior but it��s interesting here that each exertion and exhalation each meaty pulpy thump also seems to be battering the fortifications that she has built around her." Ms. Theron looks hot and color coordinated with black-and-white outfits that suit her character��s ambiguity. Lorraine smokes and drinks and likes cold baths preferably filled with ice cubes that do wonders for bruises and nipples. When she isn��t moodily bathing or staring ��� into a mirror the distance what have you ��� she does a surprising amount of walking. She goes here promenades there strolling down halls and mean streets that the director David Leitch turns into fashion runways. She doesn��t slip into rooms she cat-walks making entrances as if looking for trouble or paparazzi; it��s no wonder someone says she isn��t well disguised. Ms. Theron really is ready to play Bond." where the story soon turns into spy versus spy with washes of lurid color topsy-turvy camerawork loads of crashing cars and wall-to-wall pounding tunes. The airborne cars pirouette prettily bashing and smashing with all the technological expertise production money can buy; the symphony of body blows gun pops and crunching metal sounds fine and convincing. The tunes (���99 Luftballons��) basically just goose the violence and beg for laughs having been chosen to elicit knowing smiles of recognition. At one point James McAvoy sidles into the story looking all cool or something and wearing a smirk he needs to employ more cautiously." dress her down smack her around and wait for payback ��� isn��t new even if moviemakers like to insist otherwise. What��s moderately different here is the sexed-up packaging of the violence in combination with Ms. Theron who plays Lorraine Broughton a spy in Her Majesty��s Secret Service with a blond bob and a fondness for lethal heels. Like James Bond Lorraine shoots to kill while remaining fabulously dressed to kill. This means she gets slammed around a lot and takes almost as much punishment as she metes out. She��s a punching bag but she��s also a fantasist��s dream girl: the avenging goddess destroyer of men." ���Atomic Blonde�� is based on ���The Coldest City �� a darkly shadowed minimalist graphic novel written by Antony Johnston and illustrated by Sam Hart. As in the novel the movie continually shifts between Berlin where all the action happens and an interrogation room in which Lorraine is being drilled by some intelligence types (John Goodman Toby Jones). On the page this bifurcation works but on the screen it saps the story��s momentum partly because there��s no violence in the room to distract from the genericism and puerility of the dialogue. At least in Berlin there are streets beats and the sight of restlessly moving twisting slamming bodies." �� a model of economic genre filmmaking and he gives this movie��s action scenes the same pummeling visceral quality. Lorraine punches and is punched and her body is soon mapped by bruises and abrasions. It��s a lot of abuse for such puny returns even if the fights are the best parts of ���Atomic Blonde.�� Mr. Leitch understands the expressivity of hand-to-hand fights and he frames them accordingly pushing in when it counts and pulling back to show entire bodies in whirling motion. The closeness underscores the intimacy of battle while the distance underlines the performative aspect allowing you to see both the choreography and the violent beauty moving forward and backward one bloody step at a time." in a manner of speaking given that its strengths are lavishly violent inventively choreographed fights that have been glued together by nonsense and Charlize Theron. The nonsense involves spies chasing secrets in Berlin just before the fall of the wall which may suggest John le Carr� but plays closer to a dumb and dumber take on Boris and Natasha. Mostly the movie is an excuse to watch a beautiful deviously clever female avatar as she is stripped naked dolled up and repeatedly beaten down only to rise again."

of course can hardly be objective. The language of cinematic action ��� which Ms. Bigelow speaks as fluently and inventively as any living American director ��� is an idiom of feeling and visceral response. There are parts of ���Detroit�� that have a raw unsettled authenticity and others that sink in a welter of screaming and cursing." which paints a sometimes muddled picture of a chaotic and contested moment in history is admirably clear in this regard. It understands and strives to dramatize racism not as a matter of bad personal attitudes or equal and opposite prejudices but rather as a structuring fact of American life an apparatus of power exclusion and control wielded against ���them.��" ���change had to come�� and ���the question was when and how.�� But the promise implied in that ���how�� is one that ���Detroit �� for all its impressive craft and unimpeachable intention proves unable to fulfill. It is curious that a movie set against a backdrop of black resistance and rebellion ��� however inchoate and self-destructive its expression may have been ��� should become a tale of black helplessness and passivity. The white men the decent ones as much as the brutes have the answers the power the agency." not only for the characters who are stuck inside at the mercy of a maniac but for the film itself which loses its political and psychological coherence as the night drags on. Krauss with his disconcertingly boyish looks and his sophomoric attempts to seem thoughtful is a callow sociopath. His fellow officers Flynn (Ben O��Toole) and Demens (Jack Reynor) contribute sexual hysteria (when they see white women in the company of black men) and sheer idiocy. They are terrifying and contemptible ��� dismayingly believable figures from the prehistory of what is now called the alt-right." �� but the most troubling and divisive words uttered onscreen are variations on the simple pronouns ���they�� and ���them.�� The words may be perfectly neutral in themselves but when used to separate one group of people from another they take on an insidious implicitly violent connotation." the screenwriter (who collaborated with her on ���The Hurt Locker�� and ���Zero Dark Thirty��) train their focus on two aspects of the Detroit story: the day-to-day texture of working-class black life and the operations of white supremacy in conditions of emergency. Balancing those concerns is no easy task and the filmmakers don��t take an easy route through their material. ���Detroit �� like its namesake city is populous and contradictory with dozens of significant characters competing for attention as richly detailed scenes swell in crescendos of desperate suspense and sickening brutality." residential segregation and heavy-handed law enforcement that preceded the 1967 riots in Detroit and other Northern cities ��� zero in on the rebellion��s immediate cause: a late-night police raid on an unlicensed saloon." a soldier just back from Vietnam. A few blocks away Melvin Dismukes (Mr. Boyega) a black security guard protecting a grocery store brings coffee to a group of National Guardsmen a gesture of diplomacy as well as self-protection. ���I don��t want those boys shooting at us �� he tells his co-worker. Meanwhile three patrolmen cruise the city. One of them Krauss (Mr. Poulter) is still on the job after fatally shooting an unarmed looting suspect in the back." and in it ���them�� is most often used ��� along with cognates like ���those people�� and ���you people�� ��� by white soldiers and police officers to refer to African-American citizens. (Nearly every white character with a speaking role wears a uniform of some kind.) Occasionally things go in the other direction with ���they�� referring to the white authorities but the reversal doesn��t indicate any kind of symmetry." the humanity of their hostages begins to blur. In a horror movie the monster is inevitably the center of interest and once the first body in the motel falls ���Detroit�� begins to trade its vivid sense of nuance ��� especially present in its delicate observation of Fred and Larry��s friendship ��� for bluntness and sensationalism. A complex dreadful piece of history becomes an undialectical ordeal of viciousness and victimhood." a narrower plot takes shape a real-life horror movie folded into a baggier film that feels by turns like a combat picture a cavalry western a police procedural and a courtroom drama." and one that has an especially grim resonance in our own time. Three black men were shot to death ��� nine other people were terrorized and beaten ��� after the police and guardsmen arrived at the motel responding to reports of sniper fire." you feel in tune with both the fine grain of experience and the larger sweep of history. The specific close-up acts of cruelty you witness are comprehensible as manifestations of a systemic continuing and frequently invisible pattern of injustice. The film��s struggle against simplification ��� against the sentimentality wishful thinking and outright denial that defines most Hollywood considerations of America��s racial past ��� is palpable almost heroic even if it is not always successful." in effect to its African-American characters to refuse to let racism have the final word and to free themselves of storytelling conventions that insist on comfort and consensus. It doesn��t quite work. American movies have a hard time with division and with real-world problems that have yet to be solved. American politics does too. The great virtue of ���Detroit�� is that it recognizes this difficulty. The failure to overcome it is hardly the film��s alone." error and intentional evil that produced a tragic result. The important thing is not the literal accuracy of the overall account (though Mr. Boal a former journalist has been diligent in his research) but its plausibility. Is this what could have happened? Does it feel true?" producing an intuitive understanding of events that quickly spiral beyond the control or comprehension of their participants. Her combination of efficiency and expressiveness is matched by the actors ��� a formidable mostly youthful ensemble including John Boyega Will Poulter Algee Smith and Jason Mitchell ��� even though the script at times inhibits their range locking them into simple stances of aggression and fear." and this episode while not as notorious as some other race-related murders of its era isn��t all that obscure. (It is the subject of a book by John Hersey a writer for The New Yorker published a year after the riots and reissued in 1997 with an informative introduction by the historian Thomas J. Sugrue.) The basic arc of the story ��� the killing of unarmed black men the spasm of outrage the impunity ultimately bestowed on the perpetrators ��� is always shocking and rarely surprising. I��m sorry if that��s a spoiler." Fred (Jacob Latimore) and Larry (Mr. Smith) are looking for a little fun after a disappointing evening at the Fox Theater downtown. They flirt with Karen (Kaitlyn Dever) and Julie (Hannah Murray) two white women and join a makeshift party in a room belonging to Carl Cooper (Mr. Mitchell)."

Dick��s science-fiction novel ���Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?�� into ���Blade Runner �� he helped create a futuristic world-weary shamus with sharp Bogart flavor." getaways that Mr. Almereyda has gathered into discrete chapters. The first opens with an offscreen Mr. Fancher discussing the Spanish word ���duende�� over battered black-and-white images of a man being shot out of a saddle in a western. ���Anything that has death in it �� Mr. Fancher says ���and wants to live beyond its limits ��� that is expressive and crazy ��� that has duende.�� Elsewhere the poet Federico Garc�_a Lorca wrote that duende is ���not a question of skill but of a style that��s truly alive: meaning it��s in the veins: meaning it��s of the most ancient culture of immediate creation.��" one of the seers behind the 1982 masterpiece ���Blade Runner �� has led the kind of fantastically eventful life that seems the stuff of fiction.

I��m not entirely sure that the Brando invitation is true even if Mr. Almereyda offers photo evidence that appears to partly back up Mr. Fancher. Yet it scarcely matters. What��s important is the story and how Mr. Fancher turns every walk down memory lane into a leisurely surprise-filled stroll through a labyrinth taking us right and then left and then down apparent dead ends before guiding us home. Of course how Mr. Almereyda tells these stories matters too." as Mr. Almereyda marshals his material which includes Mr. Fancher digressing at length as well as clips from his early TV and film work ���Escapes�� dodges the dreary obligations of the standard documentary profile to become an exploration of life as (if we��re lucky) a long endlessly inventive tale."

The three men instead set sail on their own joining a civilian fleet ��� a rousing motley armada of tugs steamers ferries and so on ��� that��s racing across the Channel. A third astounding narrative section soon opens in the air where three British Spitfire planes are quickly engaged in battle against German planes headed for Dunkirk racing through the vast canopy and bobbing under clouds as the sun flashes temporarily blinding them." but I don��t remember hearing or reading his name. Mostly I just thought of him as Our Boy less because of his youth than because of the vulnerability communicated through Mr. Whitehead��s slight figure and tangible physical performance his small and large gestures and moves: the darting panicked eyes; the nervous abrupt gestures; the hunched shoulders. In time Tommy is joined by other soldiers waiting and running and ducking on the beach the most important played by the equally fine Aneurin Barnard and the singer Harry Styles." awkwardly funny moment ��� this is a manifestly serious situation and you��re about to watch a man defecate. You don��t know whether to laugh but before you decide shots ring out and the soldiers start running the camera quickly following. The haunted emptiness is suddenly filled with the sounds of frantic escape and whizzing bullets. And then the men begin falling one two three until just the unbuckling one remains scrambling first over a gate and soon onto a beach where thousands of other soldiers are massed and waiting. He silently takes in the extraordinary scene and then hustles over to a dune to begin undoing his belt again." but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober sincere profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday��s fights and today��s. Mr. Nolan closes that distance cinematically with visual sweep and emotional intimacy with images of warfare and huddled frightened survivors that together with Hans Zimmer��s score reverberate through your body. By the time that plane is burning ��� and a young man is looking searchingly into the future ��� you are reminded that the fight against fascism continues." the film opens with six soldiers walking away from the camera down a spookily deserted street. Their bodies are shown in full head to toe and they are flanked by low buildings the sort that now look so charming in touristic photographs. Slips of paper swirl around the men like autumn leaves. A few grab at the papers. One tries slurping water from a nearby garden hose; another pokes a hand through an open window searching for a smoke. Still another reads one of the papers which shows a map of the surrounding area encircled by arrows and ominous words of warning in English. He then crumples it unbuckles his belt and begins to squat." the lines dividing the three narrative segments mostly sharpen. Even as each section ��� with its individual dramas and perils ��� comes closer into view Mr. Nolan keeps them all in dynamic play with one another. Some of this he achieves with stark visual echoes as when water rushing into a downed Spitfire engulfs the pilot and elsewhere a soldier nearly drowns. (Tom Hardy plays the most critically important pilot while a sympathetic Jack Lowden takes on a critical support role.) At one point Mr. Nolan pulls the three narrative strands tightly together creating a tremendous enveloping sense of bone-deep dread." one told through soldiers their lived and near-death experiences and their bodies under siege. Names are generally irrelevant here; on the beach ��� and in the sea and air ��� what counts are rank unit skill and the operation although more important is survival making it through another attack and somehow avoiding exploding bombs. Mr. Nolan��s emphasis on the visceral reality of Dunkirk leaves much unsaid; even in some opening explanatory text the enemy isn��t identified as Nazi Germany. The soldiers of course know exactly who they are fighting and perhaps even why but in the field the enemy is finally the unnamed stranger trying to kill them." yet much has been expressed: isolation; danger; desperation; fear; relief; and sheer extreme bodily need and effort. Throughout this de facto prologue Mr. Nolan emphasizes the concrete details making you acutely aware of the fine-grained textures ��� the sores and embedded dirt on a man��s hands ��� and every resonant sound: the dribbling of water the fluttering of paper and the sharp crack and mechanical buzzing of rifle fire that turns into muffled thuds when bullets enter bodies. By the time the surviving soldier reaches the beach you are already closely acquainted with his heavy breathing wild fumbling and clumsy chaotic running." �� Christopher Nolan��s brilliant new film is of a British plane in flames. The movie recounts an early harrowing campaign in World War II that took place months after Germany invaded Poland and weeks after Hitler��s forces started rolling into the Netherlands Belgium Luxembourg and France. The plane having glided to a stop has been defiantly set ablaze by the pilot to avoid its being captured. It��s an image of unambiguous defeat but also an emblem of resistance and a portent of the ghastly conflagrations still to come." �� which oscillates among its three sections each largely taking place in distinct locations in different time frames. The events on the beach ��� called the Mole for the breakwater that��s used as a dock ��� unfold during one week. The events on the sea occur in one day while the air scenes transpire in an hour. The locations and the time periods are announced onscreen. At first the dividing lines aren��t always obvious as Mr. Nolan cuts from daytime scenes on the ground to those in the sea and in the air a slight merging of space and especially of time that underlines the enormity of a fight seemingly without end." including lump-in-the throat home-front tales like ���Mrs. Miniver.�� ���Dunkirk�� takes place in battle but it too is a story of suffering and survival. Mr. Nolan largely avoids the bigger historical picture (among other things the reason these men are fighting is a given) as well as the strategizing on the front and in London where the new prime minister Winston Churchill was facing the horrifying possibility of diminished military muscle. Churchill is heard from in a fashion but never seen. Mr. Nolan instead narrows in on a handful of men who are scrambling and white-knuckling their way into history on the sea in the air and on the ground." a balance that is as much a political choice as an aesthetic one. And ���Dunkirk�� is big ��� in subject reach emotion and image. Mr. Nolan shot and mostly finished it on large-format film (unusual in our digital era) which allows details to emerge in great scale. Overhead shots of soldiers scattered across a beach convey an unnerving isolation ��� as if these were the last souls on earth terminally alone deserted. (Seen on a television they would look like ants.) Film also enriches the texture of the image; it draws you to it which is crucial given the minimalist dialogue." where some 400 000 Allied soldiers ��� including more than 200 000 members of the British Expeditionary Force the British army in Western Europe ��� were penned in by the Germans. The British faced with the capture or possible annihilation of their troops initiated a seemingly impossible rescue.

On their first foray into the woods Will and Danny encounter two of them. Eventually Danny ends up as a hostage to one Levi (Gethin Anthony in the film��s best performance) who teaches the boy more about self-confidence and dealing with adversity than Will ever did." the movie tries for a second bit of topicality by including a subplot pegged to the high cost of health care.

more to the point it might remind oldish viewers of a certain kind of observant clever but unambitious independent film that came to prominence in the era it depicts.

She is both more reckless and more grounded than her parents suspect." who wrote it with Elisabeth Holm. They also collaborated on ���Obvious Child �� which starred Ms. Slate and which was notable for the mixture of sweetness and candor it brought to the subject of abortion. There was something bracing as well as brave about that film��s honesty. Oddly the new one is much more cautious and decorous in its treatment of the emotional dynamics of a complicated family. For all the profanity and naughty behavior it has the timid ingratiating vibe of a television sitcom sticking to safe and familiar emotional territory." they would now be in their early and later 40s. The fact that they seem so much like present-day young people is less an anachronism than an aspect of the film��s hopeful soothing attitude. It��s a peace offering from Generation X to the millennials a gesture of solidarity from one cohort of the metropolitan upper-middle class to another. We��re just like you and we��ll all grow up eventually." the younger of the two Jacobs daughters discovers a trove of erotic poetry her father has been writing to someone other than his wife. These proto-sexts are part of a small epidemic of infidelity among the Jacobses. Ali��s older sister Dana (Jenny Slate) recently engaged to her live-in boyfriend Ben (Jay Duplass) sparks up some action on the side with Nate (Finn Wittrock) a guy she knew in college. ���We��re a family of cheaters �� Ali says in disgust." �� a fairly genial diffident comedy about diffident fairly generic people plants its flag in 1995 and surveys a landscape of indie rock ���Must See TV�� and the high-waisted bluejeans that have recently started coming back into fashion. Hillary Clinton is on television sporting a hairband and a pink suit." though as the movie��s title whimsically suggests the mid-90s were an era of adorably quaint technology. Characters make calls from pay phones and listen to messages on answering machines. They take pictures with boxy little cameras rent videocassettes of movies and make mix tapes on actual cassette tape. The members of an upper-middle-class New York household share a single desktop computer with a dot-matrix printer and a slot for floppy disks." with their lived-in faces and deeply seasoned acting technique provide Alan and Pat with more individuality than the script does. The filmmakers seem hesitant to make any of their characters too interesting. Each one is an assemblage of surface quirks and emotional responses neatly inserted into a series of dramatic and comic situations. Some of these pay off nicely in particular when Ms. Slate and Ms. Quinn share the screen and capture the jumpy push-and-pull rhythms of loving but not entirely compatible sisters." meanwhile are near-caricatures of middle-aged compromise. Alan (John Turturro) clings to his literary ambitions and works at an advertising agency. His wife Pat (Edie Falco) works in environmental policy but doesn��t talk much about it.

interspecies sex might function better as a sick joke than an earnest metaphor. That��s a matter of taste I guess." though which is that ���The Untamed�� is not a slice-of-life tale pretending to be a monster movie but rather a bone-dry comedy pretending to be both of those things. There is a fine line between horror and humor and if you adjust your angle of vision accordingly you can see the architecture of farce beneath the ornamentation of shock and suffering. The meticulous deadpan of the performances diverts attention from the absurdity of the circumstances. Fabi��n �ngel and Alejandra are joined in a classic triangle which Ver�_nica and the alien throw into high relief even as they disrupt it." ���Heli �� was about a factory worker caught up in Mexico��s drug violence. It contains several horrific ��� and now notorious ��� scenes of brutality but what makes those moments especially unnerving is the low-key domestic naturalism in which they are embedded. Mr. Escalante is an exceptionally deft and subtle realist and you sometimes feel in ���Heli�� and even more so in ���The Untamed�� that he is drawn to extremity partly out of boredom with his own skill. And so he turns a downbeat melodrama of unhappy marriage bohemian drift and sexual duplicity into something bizarre and horrific." but its more salient provenance is a pornographic tradition notably but not exclusively Japanese that occasionally slithers into the cinematic mainstream. The alien whose gender is indeterminate is awesome in bed though not always gentle. While its partners male and female experience inexpressible and addictive bliss in its company some of them also suffer grievous and even fatal injuries." ���The Untamed�� behaves like a quiet horror movie with a lot on its mind. Its main characters who live in the central Mexican city of Guanajuato are young gloomy attractive men and women connected by friendship family ties and sexual longing and divided by those same things. The movie directed by Amat Escalante from a script he wrote with Gibr��n Portela might be a dour observant study of modern relationships among the urban middle class were it not for the presence of a slimy many-tentacled space creature living in a cabin in the countryside." she befriends Fabi��n (Eden Villavicencio) a nurse. His sister Alejandra (Ruth Ramos) is married to �ngel (Jes�_s Meza) a drunken macho sad sack who is having an affair with Fabi��n. Fabi��n encouraged by Ver�_nica finds his way to the extraterrestrial love shack (which is tended by a sweet hippie-ish older couple).

Alas Mr. Schroeder best known for ���Reversal of Fortune �� has tethered both his actress and this natural glory to an awkward unpersuasive story largely set in the early 1990s that coalesces around the lingering effects of World War II on the German soul. The war��s impact on Martha takes a while to emerge ostensibly because she doesn��t like to talk about it or even to identify as German. She also doesn��t speak the language even with her new neighbor Jo (Max Riemelt) a young German D.J. camped out in a nearby house." the emotions complex. It takes a while for the true depth of all the complicated confusing feelings to surface partly because the movie��s most interesting character the German-born Martha (Marthe Keller) has done a good job of barricading off part of her being. But don��t weep too hard for her: She��s built that wall in enviable splendor on the Spanish island of Ibiza where she lives alone in a white house overlooking the blue blue Mediterranean." but he��s soon scampering after Martha like a hungry puppy.

There��s an agreeable timelessness to their blessedly languorous moments to their talks and walks amid the beauty of Ibiza. ���Amnesia�� is filled with conversations ��� often delivered in somewhat dissonant sometimes halting English ��� peppered with bits of exposition and quotidian asides about say cooking with herbs (a little lemon verbena is perfect for fish). Later when everything has come to a head the ease of all this talk gives way to lurching rounds of confession and accusation that stop the movie dead." �� Mr. Schroeder has said is a story partly based on his mother who refused to speak German so perhaps it��s no surprise that it��s strongest when it focuses on Martha a character Ms. Keller inhabits gracefully. You believe Martha who��s at home in the particular world that Mr. Schroeder has made for her. That��s the case even when you don��t wholly trust the words coming out of her mouth especially when she��s indulging Jo. Mr. Riemelt has a few fine moments in the movie but over all his smiles tend to be too wide and his body language too eager when Jo is around Martha which makes the evolution of their relationship and finally the movie feel forced."

I feel I can say with certainty that 2017 will go down in film history as the Year of the Crazy Dane DeHaan Movie. Already so far we have seen Mr. DeHaan a 31-year-old actor endowed with poise intelligence and superb eyebrows in Gore Verbinski��s highly puzzling ���A Cure for Wellness.�� If you missed that one it was more or less ���The Magic Mountain�� with incest and bloodsucking eels." and I suspect Mr. Besson doesn��t either.

Anyway Valerian and Laureline are as cute as a pair of baby salamanders." but there is so much more going on. To say that ���Valerian�� is a science-fiction epic doesn��t quite do it justice.

poetry is fundamentally a sensual undertaking and Mr. Jodorowsky is a voracious poet of the flesh. It��s too easy to describe his interest in unusually large and small bodies in wounded and painted skin in amputation and contortion as perverse freakish or provocative.

But in his two recent autobiographical films ��� ���The Dance of Reality�� and now ���Endless Poetry�� ��� Mr. Jodorowsky at 88 shows the irrepressible energy of a man who is just getting started." but it has a tendency to meander and repeat itself.

He can��t beam his visions directly into your brain or tattoo his words on your body but this is the next best thing." but Mr. Jodorowsky nonetheless evokes the chaotic passionate spirit of a time and offers astute insights into his own psychology. He uses masquerade puppetry theatrical lighting and set design and the luridly expressive cinematography of the great Christopher Doyle to create a world of hallucinatory artifice. Alejandro��s mother Sara who sings all her dialogue in fluting operatic tones is played by Pamela Flores who also plays Stella the young poet��s beer-drinking cigar-smoking protector and sort-of lover.

the characters occasionally meet on a large terrace overlooking the street where passers-by storefronts and restaurant signs give the movie tiny jolts of reality like little puffs of oxygen. Every so often they convene and scheme on the theater��s foyer stairway which has been scattered with women��s shoes a conceit seemingly borrowed from the production. In an apparent attempt to literalize the play��s self-declared deceits Mr. Bondy draws attention to the artificiality of the location ��� you��re always aware this takes place in a theater ��� a contrivance that��s matched by brittle outsize performances that turn faces into masks of surprise sorrow and so on." Mr. Bondy directed this movie during the play��s run shooting before evening curtain call. This surely was convenient but the Od�on and its backstage spaces make an awkward backdrop at least the way Mr. Bondy uses them. He��s fond of ungainly pointless overhead shots that suggest he was trying to make the camera work in cramped spaces or maybe convey the view from the balcony." Louis Garrel and a handful of other French actors perform the 1737 comedy ���The False Confessions�� onstage although what that something would have been is unclear from a movie based on the production. Written by Pierre de Marivaux (1688-1763) the play is one of those romantic intrigues involving charming paramours scheming servants and much bustling in and out of rooms amid conspiratorial conversations. A Marivaux contemporary said that his only subject was ���the eternal surprise of love �� though it seems doubtful anyone seeing this play was ever truly startled." wealthy widow Araminte (Ms. Huppert) and a handsome insolvent gentleman Dorante (Mr. Garrel) ��� at least in carefree pre-revolutionary France (and rich-girl/poor-boy Hollywood fantasies). They��re brought together by Dubois (Yves Jacques) Araminte��s servant who was once Dorante��s valet. One of those wily devoted domestics who greases the gears Dubois has conspired to secure Dorante a position in Araminte��s household. Dorante is in love with Araminte despite never having spoken to her while she knows nothing of his love. The idea is that proximity will light the fire fanned by secrets and lies and a lot of arch dialogue." a well-regarded theater director with a few films on his r�sum� died in December 2015 and according to the movie��s production notes his wife Marie-Louise Bischofberger helped finish ���False Confessions.�� It��s impossible to know if this is the movie he wanted to make or not. Some online clips from the stage production suggest that it might have been pleasurable to watch Ms. Huppert and Mr. Garrel in person and perhaps their charisma enlivened what comes across onscreen as impossibly stale.

���Lady Macbeth�� opens with Katherine at the marriage altar her head draped in a white veil that suggests virtue and slyly hints at the blood that will spill. She��s soon in the bedroom with her husband Alexander (Paul Hilton) a scowler with angry accusatory eyes who isn��t interested in her sexually or any other way. Their first night together he brusquely orders her to undress only to crawl into bed leaving her naked untouched and puzzled. This remains the template for a somewhat mysteriously cheerless loveless marriage that finds Katherine more of a prisoner than a wife." Katherine watches and we watch her watching as the quiet grows louder and the stillness grows eerier. Bidden to stay indoors ��� somehow the fresh air would be bad for her or so the men of the house insist ��� she spends much of her time staring out a window a familiar pastime for repressed yearning women in fiction. Of Madame Bovary the theorist Stephen Heath wrote: ���The window is the frame of Emma��s dissatisfaction.�� The same holds true for Katherine whose window reveals the life that she��s been cut off from even as it reminds her day after lonely night of the freedom on the other side of the glass." this version of ���Lady Macbeth�� is most successfully complicated by Anna a sympathetic character who doesn��t exist in the novella but takes on mounting importance here. Katherine having been radically isolated by her husband and father-in-law has no friends. Anna is Katherine��s closest companion by default and serves as maid and occasional minder; over time Anna also becomes a moving horrified witness to Katherine��s crimes emotion that warms the insistent chill. That Anna is played by a black actress and Katherine by a white one adds race to the thickening intrigue making a story of female oppression and domination power and privilege that much more harrowing and ugly." �� an 1865 novella by Nikolai Leskov that Dmitri Shostakovich turned into an opera and Andrzej Wajda adapted into a film. Like the novella the movie opens up some interpretive leeway as it invites your sympathy for Katherine. She��s an unambiguous captive trapped by sex and class yet the viciousness that her liberation awakens ��� as carnal lust slips into bloodlust ��� precludes a facile redemptive reading. Mr. Oldroyd boxes Katherine in his attractive visuals imprisoning her as her male relatives do. Yet his intellectual distance also turns her into a specimen a pinned butterfly turned taxidermy beast." of course rocking Katherine the story and the visual order. Alexander leaves ��� there��s trouble at the family colliery ��� creating a void that she rapidly fills. She starts a bold increasingly reckless affair with a groomsman Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis) a rough number wildly out of his league and depth. Adultery soon begets murder but even when Katherine is standing over a second corpse it��s not obvious whether she��s a newly sprung prisoner of gender with a reasonable sociopolitical alibi (the patriarchy made her do it!) or just a psychopath in a fetching peacock-blue gown. Mr. Oldroyd doesn��t tip his hand forcing you to choose." that she��s the one who sleeps with death the one pouring evil into her husband��s ear. Certainly the invocation of Shakespeare tips that there��s something dangerous about the lady of its house an opaque beauty called Katherine (a very fine Florence Pugh). Yet part of this movie��s ticklish nastiness is that at first it isn��t at all clear whether she will be the master of doom or its helpmate. At just 17 Katherine looks like the innocent flower but something wicked this way comes seductively then savagely." beautifully. Katherine is soon bored but the director William Oldroyd ensures that you aren��t with his use of sepulchral quiet mesmerizingly steady framing and unnerving order in which nothing is ever out of place especially nothing human. There seem to be no books in the house which is maintained by beaten-down servants and overseen by Alexander��s even more unpleasant father Boris (a good Christopher Fairbank). Everything looks superficially lovely especially Katherine who is brushed and cinched primped and readied by her maid Anna (Naomi Ackie) like a doll that no one plays with. It��s unclear if Katherine can read; at times she barely speaks."

The spectacle of people��s rejoicing in the destruction of their own kind is upsetting and as the audience absorbs the apes�� shock we become aware of another deeper unease. We are now three movies into this reborn franchise entirely on the side of the apes. The prospect of our own extinction far from horrifying comes as a relief. At last the poor planet will catch a break." bridging ���Rise�� and ���War�� ��� you may recall that poor abused laboratory chimp��s evolution from victim to nemesis. The damage Koba had suffered at the hands of humans made him intolerant and fanatical an embodiment of political extremism who needed to be checked and ultimately destroyed by Caesar whose political temperament tended toward moderation and compromise. Their conflict was mirrored by a struggle on the human side between a genocidal ape-hating military commander and a rival leader who believed in coexistence." a moment of rousing and dreadful cinematic clarity that I don��t expect to shake off any time soon. I��ll tread lightly but I don��t think anything I say here can spoil its power." �� like ���Rise�� before it rested on a hopeful slightly hokey message of interspecies harmony. In spite of their differences and mutual suspicions maybe the two primate societies one coalescing while the other slid toward chaos could share the Earth or at least the stretch of Northern California forest where this franchise plants its allegorical flag." and for long stretches their adventures unfold without much human interaction though they do adopt a mute human orphan (Amiah Miller) shortly before they meet Bad Ape. Our ilk is in a bad way and not only because of the fanatical desperate militarism represented by the Colonel. A new strain of virus is robbing people of their ability to speak accelerating a reversal of species hierarchy set in motion two movies ago when Caesar first howled the word ���no.��" sadder hero now and in ���War�� he succumbs for a while to a vengeful impulse at odds with his essential high-mindedness. You could say that he is putting his humanity at risk or that he��s only human after all but of course both descriptions would be absurd. We��ll have to come up with a new vocabulary but while we still have this one ��� and while flesh-and-blood people are still directing digital gorillas and chimps ��� I��ll just say that it��s good to see a movie so thoroughly humane." to put it another way Koba was right." �� directed by Matt Reeves is the grimmest episode so far and also the strongest a superb example ��� rare in this era of sloppily constructed commercially hedged cinematic universes ��� of clear thinking wedded to inventive technique in popular filmmaking. The distinction of this run of ���Planet of the Apes�� movies has been its commitment to the venerable belief that science fiction belongs to the literature of ideas and its willingness to risk seeming to take itself too seriously. Each episode has pursued a stark ethical or political problem and each has shifted the moral ground from human to ape." and the victors having slaughtered the enemy burst into raucous cheers. It��s the kind of thing we��ve seen in movies dozens of times before: the cheapening of mass death into an easy win for the good guys. Except that in this case we the humans in the theater seats are not the only ones watching. A crowd of apes is also present an emerging society whose national epic this film and its companions have marvelously and improbably become. The apes pause to witness the aftermath of the carnage they have narrowly escaped and their wordless shocked response registered above all on the face of Caesar their leader is an eloquent rebuke to a species that has abandoned any but a biological claim to the name human." the motion-captured digitally sculpted apes are so natural so expressive so beautifully integrated into their environment that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces often seen in close-up. Andy Serkis��s performance as Caesar is one of the marvels of modern screen acting and it��s complemented by those of Karin Konoval reprising her role as the wise orangutan Maurice and Steve Zahn as a sad-clown sidekick named Bad Ape." though it��s a lot of fun in spite of the somber picture I��ve been painting. Mr. Reeves who also directed ���Dawn �� has a dark vision but also a light touch when necessary and above all a commitment to creating a world that is coherent as well as fantastical. This world is also intensely and somewhat unimaginatively masculine. The default setting for primate social organization in these movies human and otherwise is patriarchal and while a few female apes and a young human girl appear on screen the filmmakers�� inability to flesh out the familial and affective dimensions of an otherwise richly rendered reality is frustrating." about the tension between recognizing them as sentient beings and the long habit of exploiting and confining them. ���Dawn�� was a wishful parable of decolonization and counterinsurgency concerned with the competing but equally legitimate claims of two tribes occupying adjacent territory. ���War�� ��� which in spite of its title is less a war film than a western wrapped around a prison movie ��� vindicates Koba��s view of humanity as irredeemably cruel and deceitful." as some of his followers have drifted from militant anti-Caesarism to collaboration with the enemy species. There is a new nemesis in town a renegade colonel played by Woody Harrelson who goes full Heart of Darkness staging a one-man remake of ���Apocalypse Now�� in a medical base he has refashioned into a concentration camp.

Ms. Okpokwasili��s fearless writing and intense virtuosic performance style make the story of two black girls discovering their sexuality while growing up in the Bronx seem torn from her own life. (The piece is not autobiographical however.) Ideas of female and black beauty are explored with language that is frequently profane ��� hardly any of it is quotable here ��� and always charged. The narrative unfolds via a series of letters Ms. Okpokwasili reads from but her words are punctuated by movements that are at times balletic at other times pure James Brown meets punk rock. She hits the stage floor hard and more than once." �� Ms. Okpokwasili does nothing but vibrate violently.

Ms. Okpokwasili��s often academic-sounding exegeses of her work become repetitive. Given the aesthetically confrontational nature of the piece one can understand why Mr. Rossi did not attempt an undiluted cinematic translation of the complete ���Bronx Gothic.�� But something about his approach (which I assume was approved by Ms. Okpokwasili as she is one of the movie��s executive producers) feels finally like an evasion." doting on her lovely daughter and having pointed discussions about race with her husband Peter Born ��� who is white and also the director of the stage work.

Mr. Heineman who is also the movie��s cinematographer more or less opens and closes the documentary in 2015 with some of the activists in New York where R.B.S.S. received an award from the nonprofit group the Committee to Protect Journalists. It��s a distracting framing device that suggests Mr. Heineman believed that he first needed to give his audience reassuringly recognizable faces. Cut to David Remnick editor of The New Yorker at the podium." which they do in smoothly edited tag-team voice-over in on-camera scenes from their life abroad and in ghastly underground images recorded in Raqqa. It��s an account of heroic resistance that essentially begins in 2011 when the Arab Spring reached Syria (���we started to scream for freedom��) and peaceful demonstrations against President Assad were met with state violence followed by power grabs. Along the way Mr. Heineman furnishes a sketchy look at the various players and geopolitical stakes glossing over Syria��s historical complexities and the role that the United States has played in the rise of ISIS." funneling news to outside agencies the dead in this movie ��� decapitated crucified shot ��� come close to overwhelming the living. In a few instances Mr. Heineman shows men being shot point blank in the head; elsewhere he cuts way before the fatal moment which turns these murders into appalling cinematic cliffhangers. He seems to believe that it��s crucial to include numerous unfiltered ISIS atrocities but raw and blurred versions of savagery prove this false. Mr. Heineman is clearly passionate and sincere but he doesn��t fully grasp the power of suggestion or the audience��s capacity for empathy. You don��t need to watch a man die to understand the horror of his death." the caliph Harun al-Rashid moved the seat of the Muslim Empire to the northern Syrian city of Raqqa on the banks of the Euphrates. There Harun ��� the inspiration for a caliph in ���One Thousand and One Nights�� ��� is said to have played polo and perfumed the air with garments worn by female slaves.

American-backed forces are currently battling ISIS for control of a city in ruins." �� a blunt instrument of a documentary is an urgent and heart-heavy account of Syrian resistance from the ground up. Specifically it recounts the story and activism of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently or R.B.S.S. a citizen-journalist initiative that emerged in April 2014 to secretly record the atrocities committed by ISIS in Raqqa. (R.B.S.S.��s website states that the group is nonpartisan and explains that it is ���a campaign launched by a group of nonviolent activists in Raqqa to expose the atrocities committed by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and terrorist extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria�� toward civilians in that city.)" and Mohamad was a teacher turned reporter but not much else about the group��s origins comes through. Mr. Heineman glides over the nuts and bolts of its operational beginning. He may not have thought it germane or maybe thought covering it might have endangered lives. Or perhaps Mr. Heineman an excitingly visceral director ��� his last documentary was ���Cartel Land�� ��� thought it might slow this fast-paced feature down. Like the Arab Spring represented in the movie R.B.S.S. almost seems to have spontaneously erupted." as well as greater restraint in the use of atrocity images might have deepened a movie that leans on shortcuts and visual shocks. In ���City of Ghosts �� Mr. Heineman marshals some incredible material ��� including on-the-run undercover cellphone imagery ��� into a moving record of extraordinary individual and collective heroism one that eventually emphasizes the personal over the political.

The two chat awkwardly and when Isolde gets off the bus the movie unexpectedly follows her and shows her walking in on a sexual liaison between a teenage girl and an older tennis coach." often leaving big empty spaces in the middle of the composition while a telling detail looks out at the viewer from a far corner. Similarly a narrative development involving a character who acts as a catalytic agent in certain scenes brings a different set of concerns to the movie��s forefront and could catch a viewer off guard; it��s clearly meant to." and it becomes clear that there��s some trouble ahead. Stanley engages in a tentative romance with Isolde while developing with his assigned group of classmates a theater piece about the sex scandal ��� knowing all the while that the other party in the incident is Isolde��s older sister." despite its having been foreshadowed. Your mileage may vary but for myself ���The Rehearsal�� delivers a good hour and a half of engagement and intrigue only to top it off with a cherry that left me asking ���Really?��" adapting ��� and rather freely at that ��� the debut novel by Eleanor Catton (whose second novel ���The Luminaries �� won the 2013 Man Booker Prize). The movie opens with an overhead shot of a desktop cluttered with applications and head shots of teenagers paper-clipped to them and the chatter of adults arguing for and against their favored kids. They seem like Olympian gods trying to determine which mortals they want to mess with." and the tennis instructor is rather famous and a scandal ensues. Stanley learns about it via a TV screen while he is bartending to pay his school bills. The movie takes an oblique almost offhand approach to narrative for its first hour. It focuses on the quotidian details of life among a group of talented students and demanding sometimes capricious and cruel teachers the most vivid of whom Hannah (Kerry Fox) has taken an interest in Stanley." it convincingly conveys the raw feelings that result when life and art rub too fiercely against each other and how the wounds are that much more severe when you add adolescence to the mix. ���The Rehearsal�� also accomplishes the tricky task of demonstrating how actors with plain talent and little more gain credibility with training and polish.

most of it aimed at delivering easy superficial terror. The scariest scene in ���A Ghost Story�� may be the most human when a random guy at a party won��t stop talking about the meaningless of existence in an indifferent universe. Dude we know! Shut up! Ghostie��s silence at that moment speaks volumes and his inscrutable presence is a reminder that fright may be an unjust irrational response to him and his kind. We fear what we don��t understand and a ghost is only human after all." Mr. Affleck and Rooney Mara ��� her character is also unnamed ��� live together in a ranch house in the middle of somewhere. They argue a little about moving but otherwise they pursue a low-key harmonious semi-bohemian existence. He writes songs and experiments with sound. She goes off to work in the morning. They whisper and look gorgeous and occasionally exchange tender tentative smiles. In some ways these two (and the other human beings who show up from time to time) are the real ghosts in the story ��� abstract almost theoretical creatures floating in and out of Ghostie��s troubled consciousness." since even when he��s alive we never learn his name ��� indulges in some of the usual haunting behaviors. He knocks books off shelves makes light bulbs flicker opens closet doors in the middle of the night and subjects a terrified family to a full-scale crockery-smashing supernatural tantrum." freeze in moments and defy measurement altogether ��� is Mr. Lowery��s chief preoccupation here his major theme and his raw material. At one point early in her bereavement Ms. Mara comes home to find a pie left for her by a well-meaning acquaintance. As Ghostie looks on she takes a few forkfuls and then slumps down against a cabinet and keeps eating without haste but also without pausing for breath. The camera stays on her for several minutes which feels like an eternity. Eternity though is poor Ghostie��s problem." poignant tone and establishes the dramatic and emotional limits within which ���A Ghost Story�� will operate. Not that there aren��t jolts and surprises. Just when you think you��ve cracked the film��s circumscribed logic it opens up and goes wild in ways at once too wondrous and too preposterous to spoil. As a metaphysician Mr. Lowery is not hung up on rules but as a storyteller and an orchestrator of emotional effects he appreciates the need for coherence." and as the film proceeds growing darker and stranger we feel his impatience and disorientation. What we don��t feel is the boredom that must surely be part of the story of his long afterlife. ���A Ghost Story�� is suspenseful dourly funny and at times piercingly emotional. Daniel Hart��s musical score is full of pathos and longing compensating ��� maybe almost overcompensating ��� for the literal deadpan of the protagonist." but it feels less self-conscious than Mr. Lowery��s other recent films the gloomy Southern crime story ���Ain��t Them Bodies Saints�� (also starring Mr. Affleck and Ms. Mara) and the sweet borderline-twee remake of the ��70s children��s weepie ���Pete��s Dragon.�� ���A Ghost Story�� works so well because it shouldn��t work at all. Starting with a quote from Virginia Woolf it wears its literary pedigree on its sleeve yet it manages to feel fresh and inventive rather than stale or studied. It��s like an old tale by Saki or Henry James read for the first time: hair-raising and clever a tour de force of sensation and a triumph of craft." the literature of grief dwells on the experiences of the living the survivors who grapple with the pain of loss and the puzzle of absence. But maybe the dead have feelings too. That when you think about it is the premise of a great many ghost stories and also of ���A Ghost Story �� David Lowery��s ingenious and affecting new film." which explains the existence of haunted houses. They witness our suffering and fear but have only the most limited ability to intervene even though they seem to inhabit albeit invisibly the same physical world we do. After a while Ghostie��s sheet starts looking rumpled and dirty. It��s the only one he has and he��s been wearing it for a very long time." digitally enabled ectoplasmic possibility Mr. Lowery takes a tried-and-true low-tech Halloween-costume approach. Ghostie is a bedsheet with eyeholes. Possibly with some digital enhancement but basically a 6-year-old��s idea of a ghost. And why not? We intuit his moods through the drape and droop of the fabric (the thread count looks pretty decent) and infer a brooding smoldering temperament behind the cloth. This may be because the person inside ��� or at least the person Ghostie used to be ��� is Casey Affleck."

I know better than to take it personally when this kind of thing happens but I do often wonder why it does happen. Usually the studio (Warner Bros. in this case) thinks it has a turkey on its hands but sometimes it doesn��t know quite what it has and sneaks an interesting movie into theaters more or less by mistake.

What is most unnerving about the way their story is presented here ��� Andrew Jay Cohen directed and wrote the script with Brendan O��Brien ��� is the absence of that kind of dramatic intensity. Scott and Kate do some terrible things and induce their friends and neighbors to misbehave in sometimes frightening ways. Scott mutilates someone with an ax. More than one person actually. In addition to blackjack and roulette the casino features an occasional fight club in which upstanding folks pair off and beat each other bloody as their fellow burghers wager money on the outcome."

ideally 15 or so years old. What��s always been most appealing about Spider-Man is that he��s a kid if one who can spin big sticky webs and swing from rooftop to rooftop comparatively rinky-dink talents in the flying magic-hammering superhero world. What makes Spider-Man different and ideally work as a character giving him an off-kilter charm is he retains the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of adolescence. For all his super-gifts and despite the weird and dangerous company he keeps he is also a teenage boy ��� that��s his Kryptonite what cuts him down to recognizable human size." known to executives and true believers as the Marvel Cinematic Universe is vast complicated lucrative and ever-expanding. It��s also intrinsically uninteresting for viewers (at least one!) who just want a good movie. Marvel has produced a string of movies of wildly divergent quality but Sony has had a tougher time coming up with regular superhero successes. And so after stumbling with its first ���Spider-Man�� resurrection it cut a deal with Marvel which is also not inherently interesting. Even so it��s modestly amusing to consider that Sony much like Peter Parker here needed help getting off the ground again and so Marvel stepped in to play its Tony Stark-like guide." who��s so very good in ���Homecoming�� that he suggests a future narrative path down which the older more experienced Spider-Man might eventually go if ever allowed to truly grow up. Mr. Keaton plays the Vulture the regulation baddie who after weaponizing some extraterrestrial leftovers has become a criminal mastermind with the usual yelling minions and death. He flies around in a clunky winged apparatus that looks like something from the Wright Brothers�� steampunk phase. This makes for an amusing chunk of heavy-metal d�cor but is mostly resonant as a tepid joke about Mr. Keaton��s aerial acrobatics in ���Batman�� and ���Birdman.��" vibe and feel. The movie isn��t visually distinctive over all and while some of the better action scenes stick low to the ground as when Spider-Man crashes through suburban backyards and plays bumper cars with trash cans the airborne special-effects scenes are disappointingly lackluster particularly in the age of ambitious eye-stroking diversions like ���Doctor Strange.�� It��s hard to think of a single image in ���Homecoming�� that will transcend a first viewing the way that Peter and M. J.��s tender topsy-turvy kiss did in Sam Raimi��s first ���Spider-Man.��" �� a slick small-scaled nail-biter about two boys in peril that showed he knows where to put the camera is good with actors and has a sadistic streak which together presumably clinched his big-studio future. ���Cop Car�� is such an exercise in pressure-cooker cinema that it��s surprising how tamped down the sense of danger is in ���Homecoming �� even in some of the earlier sequences in which Peter is still puzzling out how to scuttle and swing as he vanquishes villainy. A brief scene of him sneaking into his bedroom (to avoid Marisa Tomei��s Aunt May) has more tension than any single action set piece." only some of which seem intentional. His criminality rage and perhaps his madness have been stoked by class resentment and Mr. Keaton with his white-hot menace and narrowing eyes makes him a memorably angry man not a caricature. The Vulture becomes a narrative counterweight to Tony Stark��s self-satisfied billionaire. But the Vulture is also the biggest enemy facing Spider-Man who ��� as this movie reminds you ��� is a working-class kid turned superhero. Here Spidey is eager to do a billionaire��s bidding partly because he��s being readied to join the Avengers. The question is when Spidey really grows up who will he fight for and why?" ���Homecoming�� moves along breezily enough though sometimes with too much forced airiness. It works best when it sticks close to Peter and is content to be a light good-natured story of a teenager who��s navigating through and often badly fumbling the competing demands of school home and his emergent Spidey self. Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teenager than the actors who��ve previously suited up for this series and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter��s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover as a wrong-time wrong-place criminal and Martin Starr who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing." even if it��s hard to keep track of what happened when in this on-and-off again series. Once more it spins on Peter Parker (the nice boyish Tom Holland) a teenager who develops super-skills after he��s bitten by a troublesome spider. The title of the likable amusing ���Spider-Man: Homecoming�� indicates that this is a return though to what exactly? To Queens? To youth? The rest of us can��t go home again but given that this is the second Spider-Man reboot in 15 years from Sony Pictures it seems Spidey has few other options." even if the movie plays the na�f angle too hard at times making Peter look not just inexperienced but also silly a borderline dumb cluck. The movie ��� credited to six writers and directed by Jon Watts ��� opens sometime after Peter has been bitten. He��s still trying to get his bearings and struggling to figure out the limits of his powers which is complicated here by the fact that this is the first Spider-Man movie that Sony has made with Marvel Studios. It��s a liaison that has brought Spider-Man into the Marvel worldwide domination machine which is why he��s being mentored in the way of the superhero by Marvel��s Iron Man a.k.a. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr. who pops in and out)."

The television journalists with their trench coats and stentorian inflections. The president on horseback. ���Evil Empire.�� ���Trust but verify.�� ���Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall!��" in any case you will have to go elsewhere to assess the consequences of his style of leadership and of the movement he helped bring to power. There are many fine books of course and a brilliant essay by Joan Didion. The rhetorical questions posed by earnest talking heads of the era have been rendered moot by history but Reagan��s legacy remains a live and contentious issue. His name is still routinely invoked on the left and the right with reverence and rage. ���The Reagan Show�� helps attach a face to the name but it doesn��t accomplish much more than that." or to learn something new about the 40th president this documentary directed by Sierra Pettengill and Pacho Velez and made up of ��80s-vintage archival video will prove puzzling and unsatisfying. It dwells as people often did back then on the remarkable fact that Reagan had been an actor in Hollywood but it does not chronicle the path that took him from the movies to the California governor��s mansion on his way to the White House." or with his role in the ideological transformation of American politics. Domestic policy is all but invisible. There is nothing about tax cuts supply-side economics the air traffic controllers�� strike AIDS or the Supreme Court. No Grenada no El Salvador no Lebanon. The Iran-contra scandal gets a bit of attention but only as a sidebar to the film��s main preoccupation the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union." of course and focusing on it saves ���The Reagan Show�� from triviality. The improbable diplomatic bromance between Reagan an unbending anti-Communist and Mikhail S. Gorbachev the reform-minded general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party yielded many memorable moments on the public stage. Their negotiation of an arms treaty also provides a rare and encouraging example of successful peacemaking between rival countries. While thin on strategic or historical analysis the film does provide a glimpse at the characters of the two leaders." though remains something of a cipher. What you see in these videos many of them recorded as part of a novel administration initiative called ���White House TV �� is mostly what you might remember or expect. The president seems like an affable charming man at once comfortable in his own skin and oddly detached from his surroundings with a ready supply of quips quotations and anecdotes to defuse whatever tension or discomfort might be hovering in the air. If you were predisposed to hate him you might be surprised to feel a twinge of affection. If you already admired him you may want a more robust hagiography."

Whether the crime was a botched robbery or an episode of racially motivated violence is the subject of debate.

During a montage of photographs of Ginsberg he is heard in a late-��50s audio recording reading his great poem ���America.�� Lines like ���America when will you end the human war�� and ���America why are your libraries full of tears�� resonate with a particular poignancy even today as does ���America when will you be angelic.�� ���The B-Side�� is a portrait of a genuine American angel." �� Mr. Morris��s new film is a feature of modest length on a subject of seemingly modest import particularly relative to those other movies. It begins with Ms. Dorfman herself puttering among her files of photographs (and the documentary stays with her in this room for about 75 percent of its running time); she speaks at first of a large portrait of her husband and the fluorescent vest she has sewn on his overcoat (he��s wearing it in the picture) to keep him visible when he walks through streets at night while running errands. If you didn��t know anything about Ms. Dorfman who��s 80 you might initially take her for a nice old lady with an unusual hobby ��� someone akin to the American eccentrics Mr. Morris portrayed in his early features such as ���Vernon Florida�� and ���Gates of Heaven.��" and of working as a secretary at the publisher Grove Press where she met the poet Allen Ginsberg a lifelong friend. She relocated to Cambridge Mass. and worked at Grolier Poetry Bookshop all the while snapping pictures of the luminaries she met there and perhaps more crucially of herself and her home life. In 1974 she published ���Elsa��s Housebook ��� A Woman��s Photojournal �� a milestone in both American photography and feminist art." a combination of luck and persistence led to her setting up a portrait studio equipped with a Polaroid camera that produced 20-inch-by-24-inch prints. Because of the nature of the instantly developing film Ms. Dorfman would take only two shots of her customers and allow them to choose which one they wanted to leave with. She kept the other ��� hence the movie��s title." do you think the camera tells the truth?�� he asks. ���Absolutely not �� she says with a laugh. Later though as she pauses in her descriptions of the pictures she pulls from her files she speaks of ���how many people are dead and how many people struggled �� and you can feel how her work has revealed some truths about that." and this is part of the point that Mr. Morris makes quietly with this enjoyable but also profound movie. Part of Mr. Morris��s reputation as a great documentary filmmaker is derived from his friendly-seeming but pressing interview technique but here when he��s heard he speaks to Ms. Dorfman as a friend and she responds to him with warm reminiscences of her beginnings as a photographer." the documentarian who is also a frequent contributor to The New York Times works in such a wide range of subjects that he��s difficult to pigeonhole. Still it would not be entirely unfair to note that his best-known films of this century are portraits of major historical figures ��� specifically two United States secretaries of defense. ���The Fog of War �� in 2003 featured the ruminations of Robert S.

It��s a performance that leaves space for nuanced interpretation ��� something that the rest of this overly conventional picture sorely lacks." however Elser��s capture and lengthy questioning by the Gestapo is a wasted opportunity to illuminate the mind of a man whom historical accounts variously describe as apolitical yet deeply concerned with workers�� rights. Bucolic flashbacks to lakeside picnics where ripe young women vie for Elser��s floppy-haired attentions and accordion serenades reveal little about his beliefs or ambitions.

it��s easy to go with Mr. Wright��s flow partly because he rarely steps off the gas. It��s just go go go with an occasional stop for coffee or an amusingly testy sit-down with Baby��s shadowy boss Doc one of those all-seeing all-knowing criminal mystics whom Kevin Spacey gives ominous ooze and a daddy��s mad (maybe nuts) indoor voice. Doc has something on Baby who��s been forced into a life of bad behavior and company. That Baby has had no choice but to drive along plays as knowingly implausible as it sounds. But heroic fatalism and unwilling villainy remain enduring cinematic tropes including in gangster movies even if it means holding convention over complexity." with shifting gears pumping feet and thumping tunes and how Mr. Wright rolls here as well. There��s a story sure about Baby getting in and out of trouble while finding love and money. He doesn��t have much of an inner life but he has skills a heavy back story and a kindly foster father Joe (CJ Jones who helps give the movie its faint heartbeat) a deaf invalid with whom he signs. Baby also has tinnitus which he quells with music; mostly he has killer timing and gracefully elastic reactive physicality that suggests Mr. Wright has put in time with the films of Jacques Tati." �� the director Edgar Wright is out to show you a most excellent time. He��s never been one of those filmmakers who expect you to be blinded by the bright sheen of his r�sum� which includes comical genre rethinks like the zombie flick ���Shaun of the Dead�� and the cop caper ���Hot Fuzz.�� Mr. Wright works for your love hard enough that you notice the whirring machinery if perhaps not the strain. He wants it easy and breezy although mostly he wants it cool whether the latest means to his end Baby (Ansel Elgort) is smooth-moving like Gene Kelly or burning rubber like Steve McQueen." especially when you��re as cleverly attentive a student as Mr. Wright. Baby drives hard fast tight and seemingly oh so effortlessly spinning wheels across pavement like a Russian Olympian on ice. In the eye-tickling opener ��� a wham bam we��ll-take-the-cash-ma��am heist ��� Baby peels out in that red box (a souped-up Subaru) and motors into one of those warped Road Runner chases that builds momentum with near escapes not-even-close winking and the twangy throbbing of ���Bellbottoms �� from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion a group once unforgettably described by the critic Robert Christgau as ���avant-travestying da blooze.��" crammed with cubistic action; glowering and golly-gee types (played by the seductive likes of Jamie Foxx Jon Hamm Eiza Gonz��lez and Lily James); and an encyclopedia of cinematic allusions all basted in wall-to-wall tuneage. At times the whole thing spins like a tribute album a collection of covers of varying quality: diner yaks �� la Quentin Tarantino Godardian splashes of color. When it works the allusions give you a contact high like when a friend turns you on to a favorite movie. At other times Mr. Wright��s pleasure veers into the self-satisfied and all that love feels smothering near-bullying like bro-cinephilia in extremis." ���Baby Driver�� is all about movement and sometimes stillness and how a beautiful man looks (feels seems is) even better when he��s in glorious syncopated restless motion. The first time you see Baby ��� that��s his handle which suits Mr. Elgort with his angelic face and young man��s lissomeness ��� he��s in the driver��s seat where he belongs. The car doesn��t look like much just a cherry-red box with doors and a spoiler. Like us Baby is waiting for the action to start seemingly sealed off from the outside world with his dark sunglasses and earbuds." �� including the satisfactions of genuine cinematic craft and technique qualities that moviegoers can no longer take for granted. The edits snap the colors pop and the cinematography serves the performances and the story rather than embalming them in an emptily showy self-regarding directorial conceit. The emotions are mostly rote and cold but the car chases are hot ��� at once fluid geometric and rhythmic with a beat Baby carries with him out of the car whether he��s on the stroll or the run. (The director of photography is Bill Pope; the editors are Paul Machliss and Jonathan Amos; and the stunt coordinator is Darrin Prescott leading an army.)" for it to put down its guns (or at least hold them differently) and transcend its clich�s and cine-quotes so it can rocket out of the genre safe box into the cosmic beyond where craft and technique transform into art. That��s admittedly somewhat of a greedy complaint particularly given how much Mr. Wright does right and that he clearly wants you levitating out of your seat. It��s difficult to carp about a director who wants to please the audience this much (instead of say the franchise suits). At the same time you have to wonder where Mr. Wright might go if he cut loose from his influences and let a little feeling muss up his form."

by turns amusing and puzzling though also melancholic and touching. For the most part these variations seem by design in a movie that flirts with assorted narrative conventions and fluctuating moods without ever settling into a familiar template. It takes some time though to figure out what the writer-director Kirsten Tan has in store for Thana and Pop Aye who are first seen trudging together along a dusty bleak stretch of road. They��re nowhere in particular certainly nowhere remotely inviting and before long they��re trying to catch a ride which is about as challenging as you might expect when one of the hitchhikers is an elephant." �� when an elephant gives the camera ��� and you ��� the stink eye. Then again maybe the elephant called Pop Aye and played by a majestic giant named Bong is just exhausted namely with people. You can��t blame him. He��s been tramping around the countryside for much of the movie usually in the fumbling company of Thana (Thaneth Warakulnukroh) an architect from Bangkok who with his marriage on the rocks and his career seriously on the skids has set off on his midlife crisis not behind the wheel of a new sports car but alongside an old elephant." like some of Ms. Tan��s other choices register as more programmatic than organic. At times the long shots create meaning giving you information and giving you room and time to breathe to look around and appreciate the very large animal dwarfing a man who seems to have shrunk inside himself; at other times the long shots feel close to art-film mannerisms. Ms. Tan is on far stronger truer ground when she moves away from Thana��s home life with his wife Bo (Penpak Sirikul in a thankless shrewish role) and leaves behind psychological explanation and matrimonial strife." ���Pop Aye�� also journeys into the interior lives of its characters a trip that is aided and abetted by other travelers who briefly hop on and off: notably a poetic squatter; a pair of bumbling cops who bust Thana and Pop Aye for eating thrown-away melon; and a transgender woman who with grit and dignity is holding onto a marginal existence. Each adds another detail a splash of color and real warmth though I wish there was more about Pop Aye more attention more close-ups. He��s beautiful and heartbreaking both because of what he adds to the story but also for all the extracinematic meaning he can��t help but bring all the pain all the tears." it emerges is on his way to his childhood home. His reasons emerge piecemeal relayed in regular flashbacks that create a mosaic-like portrait of a man whose life somehow somewhere went wrong. Not catastrophically wrong mind you just disappointingly adrift and askew. That seems to be the idea although it takes an attentive patient viewer to fit together the shards that Ms. Tan scatters throughout and to see how the flashbacks to Thana��s childhood with its pleasures and dark secrets fit in with his more recent slights and grievances including the impending demolition of one of his buildings a glass-tower monument to consumerism."

(It splits into two segments west of Spokane Wash.)" the movie is liable to turn up at a different spot along the route a sort of productive disorientation that contributes to a feeling of universality. Anyone who thinks the movie was easy to make should try getting watchable footage out of a train window. (A separate drive-along trip was necessary for the picturesque exterior shots.)" dining car meals card games and a jam session the movie makes room for perceptive observations on class race and upbringing.

its explanatory title doesn��t begin to convey just how exhilarating or inspiring a documentary this truly is and how excellent a trip this well-respected French director takes you on. Deep thoughtful immersive specific yet also wide-reaching it is an exploration of French cinema by one of its own a cinephile whose formative movie love evolved into a directing career that includes titles like ���Coup de Torchon �� ���Life and Nothing But�� and ���Captain Conan.��" while Mr. Tavernier speaks with authority this is also a highly personal enterprise. It is after all his journey one that has its own routes ports of call and charming idiosyncrasies. And while the movie more or less flows chronologically ��� he is born he sees films becomes a man sees more movies becomes a director ��� it isn��t slavishly linear. Mr. Tavernier also likes to circle back to earlier periods including ones he��s passed over or through returns that make for surprises and that reflect a profound insistent sense of history." like all good critics he never fell out of love. It��s delightful to share in that passion and a pleasure too that he��s more interested in ideas and emotions than stories and plots. If you don��t know the films he talks about you may not grasp what they��re about; it doesn��t matter. He also doesn��t identify everyone onscreen mostly I think because he really wants you to watch and listen and anyway you can read their names in the credits. I suggest you sit through them with paper and pen so you can write down the title of every movie you��ve already seen (you��ll want to watch them again) and every title you��ve never heard of (because worlds await)." France where Mr. Tavernier was born in 1941. He was born again in a sense when he saw ���Dernier Atout.�� ���That��s where a movie made its first real impact on me �� he says over gleaming black-and-white images from a chase scene with fedored gangsters motorcycle cops and lots of atmosphere. Mr. Tavernier could visualize that chase for years but it wasn��t until a quarter-century later that ��� voil��! ��� he identified it as coming from a 1942 crime film directed by Jacques Becker. ���At age 6 �� Mr. Tavernier says with a smile ���I could��ve made a worse choice.��" Mr. Tavernier mostly guides you with his voice which tethers you to his essayistic discussions. The movie is divided into sections that are punctuated by a fade to black and are largely if not exclusively centered on directors. Some are fairly straightforward; at other times Mr. Tavernier pleasurably meanders as when after a mention of boarding school he moves onto topics like Fran�_ois Truffaut and ���Shoot the Piano Player�� (���It��s the only film I saw booed on the Champs-�lys�es��); Henri Langlois a founder of the Cin�math��que Fran�_aise; Andr� Malraux��s ���L��Espoir��; other critics (���we wanted to decide for ourselves��); and the director Edmond T. Gr�ville." �� history is a thread that Mr. Tavernier uses to pull together different movies and makers creating arguments ��� about art and life time and space ��� that become autobiography. When Mr. Tavernier announces that Becker was ���one of the French directors who best understood and mastered American filmmaking �� you hear admiration in his voice. And when he adds that Becker��s passion for American cinema is evident in all his movies and lingers on that director��s love of jazz you may also flash on Mr. Tavernier��s own jazz movie �����Round Midnight.�� (Mr. Tavernier also helped write an encyclopedic book titled ���50 Years of American Cinema.��)" and every so often he floats on private currents of thought. Usually you see what he says ��� words fit the images ��� but not always. I loved the sound of ���the mise-en-sc��ne flexes emotion like you flex your muscles �� for instance but didn��t truly know what that was supposed to mean. He drops this line while discussing Becker��s ���Casque d��Or�� over a scene in which a man (Serge Reggiani) looks yearningly at a dancing woman (Simone Signoret). Still if you keep watching and listening (always a good idea) you too see the emotions ��� perhaps not flexing but rippling ��� as she whirls eyes fixed on the man not in her arms."

Throughout his director (who was born and raised in Iraq and has been observing families in the region for years) maintains a determinedly hands-off approach. This allows Mr. Sharif��s bewilderment over what he calls ���an undiagnosed war�� to become the story one that speaks specifically to the profoundly destabilizing nature of lengthy conflict." the emotions always hovering near the surface. Yet buoyed by Mr. Sharif��s cheery personality these can sometimes be defiantly upbeat." �� Zaradasht Ahmed��s sickeningly gripping portrait of a male nurse in Iraq is accepting how close we are to the point where empathy itself has become collateral damage." but for Nori Sharif a young father of four and a dedicated medic in an emergency hospital not far from Baghdad it��s a luxury he can��t afford.

especially given that she needs to make a lasting expressive impact with Emily before the character disappears and the narrative center of gravity shifts squarely to Kumail. In other words you need to fall for Emily as much as Kumail does while she pokes and prods him encouraging him to come out and play. When he��s offstage Kumail can seem as if he were waiting for something to happen and when her parents arrive in Chicago he recedes turtle-like creating a recessiveness that makes some of his deadpan discomfort even squirmier. Mostly Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Kazan look and sound ��� and importantly feel ��� like people like people you know and might fall for." Mr. Nanjiani tells longish confessional tales about say his attempts to be cool in school or watching a pornographic videotape in his parents�� home in Pakistan when the power went out. He can��t get the tape out of the VCR so he decides he has to ���pack my bags and walk the earth which sucks because I love my parents and I��m 12 years old.�� Taken out of context of course any given sentence in this kind of circuitous long-form amble doesn��t sound especially funny. But Mr. Nanjiani builds the bit artfully aided by a stealthy persona that comes across as perfectly ordinary until he deploys a puckish smile revs up his adenoidal whine and gets his heavy eyebrows dancing." as well as terrifying and confounding and it lands her in an intensive care unit hooked to life support. Before long she is in an induced coma; Kumail��s doe eyes are watering; and you��re wondering wait isn��t this supposed to be a comedy? It is and through sickness and nearly death it remains a very funny one too producing a wide range of laughs from staccato titters to abrupt guffaws and huge body-shaking bursts. The ratio of jokes to screen time is satisfyingly high and there are few stretches that aren��t enlivened by humor that joke by joke with silliness and caustic asides also deepens the movie." �� which tells a great story with waves of deep feeling and questions of identity and makes the whole thing feel like a breeze. Comedy is said to be hard; mostly I think by comics. Romantic comedy is apparently even tougher at least from recent onscreen evidence. Few filmmakers know how to fit contemporary men and women straight or gay into narrative forms that were developed once upon a time. In ���The Big Sick �� Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Gordon vault over that hurdle with openness and delight revitalizing an often moribund subgenre with a true story of love death and the everyday comedy of being a 21st-century American." �� a joyous generous-hearted romantic comedy that even as it veers into difficult terrain insists that we just need to keep on laughing. Outwardly the story seems familiar: A really nice guy falls for a woman he may not be worthy of and nearly blows it. What gives the movie both fizz and sting ��� and shows that there��s plenty of juice and possibility left in the American romantic comedy ��� are its particulars especially the comic Kumail Nanjiani who plays a fictionalized version of himself a Pakistani-American struggling to make it in stand-up while fumbling through the rest of his life." Kumail is a regular at a club where alongside his comrades ��� played by the real-life funny people Bo Burnham Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler ��� he routinely tries to make a roomful of people laugh. One evening he teasingly mixes it up with a customer Emily (a wonderful Zoe Kazan) a jittery charmer with a mile-wide smile whom he soon makes moves on. Flirtation leads to one and then another night together and before long they��re frolicking in one of those time-is-passing montages." Mr. Nanjiani who immigrated to the United States when he was a teenager mines the comedy of cultural difference in ���The Big Sick�� with a light sharp touch. In another earlier bit he talks about a roller-coaster ride which he calls the scariest experience of his life adding ���and I grew up in Pakistan.�� In the movie he drops a few terrorist-themed jokes so lightly that you��re caught off guard as much by his casual delivery as by the actual gags. You sense that he��s probably heard every ugly joke about Muslims imaginable and so he��s learned how to get there first staking a claim on a contested subject finding humor and strength in other people��s stupidity." ���The Big Sick�� plays like an extended version of one of Mr. Nanjiani��s anecdotal tales though one streaked in tears and featuring a cast that includes the perfectly paired Holly Hunter and Ray Romano as Emily��s parents. Mr. Showalter whose movies include ���Hello My Name Is Doris �� isn��t much of a visual stylist ��� the look of this movie is basically functional plus ��� but he��s terrific with actors and understands that even minor characters should be people not background. In ���The Big Sick �� you vividly see the person in each role from nurse (Myra Lucretia Taylor) to would-be bride (Kuhoo Verma) which enriches the emotional texture and underlines that there��s something at stake." who��s married to Mr. Nanjiani. They wrote ���The Big Sick�� together ��� it was directed by Michael Showalter ��� creating comedy and drama from their lives. The story tracks the giddy start of their relationship with its dazed smiles and intimacy a romance that seems to collapse when she discovers that he hasn��t told his family about her. Kumail��s parents (Anupam Kher and Zenobia Shroff both great) who live within dining distance are trying to find him a wife and have been parading appealing prospects before him. He wants to please his folks but he��s falling for Emily. He can��t decide what to do so she breaks it off but then falls gravely ill."

A muttering wanderer (an unrecognizable Jim Carrey) deposits Arlen outside its gates. The residents of this relatively benign zone are kept safe by armed guards and ramparts made of shipping containers and kept happy with hallucinogens and dance music. The D.J. is played by Diego Luna. The patriarch of Comfort ��� church state and pharmaceutical industry all at once ��� is a philosophical fellow with a droopy mustache and a retinue of pregnant concubines. He is played by Keanu Reeves." two of which figure prominently in Arlen��s subsequent adventures.

Arlen is kidnapped drugged chained up and invited to dinner one limb at a time." some voluntary skin ink and a sullen attitude.

She and her dad (Jason Momoa) ��� a taciturn muscular dude identified as Miami Man by the letters inked on his chest ��� become part of Arlen��s initially feckless increasingly determined existence. They serve as reminders of her own inconvenient humanity." the Persian-language feminist vampire melodrama ���A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night �� has already acquired a cult following. Like that film which had traces of Jim Jarmusch David Lynch and Aki Kaurismaki in its DNA ���The Bad Batch�� is not shy about showing its influences which appear to include ���Mad Max �� ���Kill Bill�� and the lean mean ��50s oaters of Budd Boetticher." �� a tale of vengeance violence power and redemption built on the ethical foundations of the traditional western scrambles and satisfies expectations at the same time. Arlen walks a well-trodden path from outlaw self-preservation to righteousness with interludes of lust confusion and drug-enhanced stargazing. She veers toward some stereotypes and refutes others keeping herself and the viewer in a state of perpetual unbalance." ecological technological and zombie-infested nightmares offer caution or consolation. Think about how bad things could get! But then again: Look how much worse they could be. Reality meanwhile inspires these dire visions and competes with them for sheer relentless awfulness." and he invests this role with the perfect alloy of gravity and goofiness. Happily ���The Bad Batch�� is much more than a sacrament for devotees of the Higher Keanuism. It is a fluent and knowing pastiche of genres and styles with a brazen and vigorous wit of its own."

a quasi-western and a revenge melodrama perhaps too many things at once.

It��s also the portrait of a group of ladies sorted by type and temperament. Miss Amy is sharp-witted and intellectually curious. Miss Jane (Angourie Rice) the princess of the group is imperious and judgmental. Miss Emily (Emma Howard) is openhearted and obliging. Miss Alicia (Elle Fanning) is sullen and sneaky. Miss Edwina (Kirsten Dunst) applies herself to her duties with an air of disappointment. They find themselves competing for McBurney��s favor as he sets about manipulating their vanities and insecurities smiling like a tomcat who has stumbled into a cage full of canaries." like the Siegel-Eastwood version on Thomas Cullinan��s novel) is a study in moods and implications picking up difficult volatile themes and then carefully putting them down again. The earlier film is a bracingly pulpy product of its moment a time when American movies were breaking free of repressive codes and reveling ��� sometimes wallowing ��� in sexual display and rough violence. It��s smutty and disturbing and feverish rooting around in the muck of the unconscious and the mess of the American past and digging up all kinds of disturbing stuff." crepuscular air.

The matriarch of the group ��� there are six of them in all ��� is Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman) who occupies an intriguing middle ground between fairy godmother and wicked stepmother a zone that is familiar real estate for Ms. Kidman." �� Sofia Coppola��s new film looks like a historical drama ��� it��s set in Virginia during the Civil War ��� but it often behaves more like a fairy tale. In the first scenes a young girl ventures out into the woods to collect mushrooms and finds a strange man under a tree: a Union soldier with a badly wounded leg and a charming Irish brogue. Is he a prince or an ogre? (He��s Colin Farrell which may or may not clarify the issue.)" ���The Beguiled�� has generated some controversy in particular for omitting all but the most cursory mention of slavery. While this doesn��t strike me as an unfair criticism ��� as Corey Atad points out in Slate an onscreen note explaining that ���the slaves left�� carries understatement to the point of historical irresponsibility ��� it also risks applying a standard that may not be entirely relevant to Ms. Coppola��s concerns." Miss Martha and her charges dwell in a realm apart from the ordinary world a gilded bubble that is both cocoon and prison. Some of this is a matter of circumstance. Versailles in ���Marie Antoinette �� the Chateau Marmont hotel in ���Somewhere �� the Tokyo Hyatt in ���Lost in Translation�� and suburbia in ���The Virgin Suicides�� and ���The Bling Ring�� ��� all of these are environments designed to quarantine their privileged residents from the disorder and misery of life." twilight quality.

By the time Fernando encounters a mute shepherd named Jesus you may have figured out that ���The Ornithologist�� is an allegory or something like it.

Soon though he has bigger troubles as rapid water sends his kayak off course." relatively realistic treatments of queer themes. ���The Ornithologist �� while containing imagery that��s influenced by Andrei Tarkovsky and Luis Bu�uel is very much Mr. Rodrigues��s own. His approach to this material occasionally brings homoerotic themes to the forefront and is very 21st-century in its knowing detachment and occasional mischief. By the same token though there are times when he flirts with the ridiculous and delves into it. Mr. Rodrigues ultimately delivers an intriguing daring film that is likely to surprise both his fans and moviegoers unfamiliar with his work." written and directed by Jo�o Pedro Rodrigues begins with a quotation from St. Anthony about the warmth a person is apt to feel when he ���approaches the Spirit�� openly.

The storytelling is also an upgrade. For one thing we finally are given a believable explanation for the purpose of Stonehenge." Cade is one of the few humans who still has some affection for Autobots the robotic immigrants from outer space who mean well but whose war with the Decepticons has resulted in all sorts of havoc on Earth. The rest of humanity is still annoyed with them for wrecking a perfectly good city Chicago earlier in the franchise." a British scholar who is skeptical of the Round Table tales and is also just the right age to be a potential romantic interest for Cade. As for Stonehenge well without giving away too much let��s just say that invaders from space are coming to suck the life out of our planet and the great monument is not merely the clunkiest calendar ever made." but the homage is nice and Cogman and Edmund have some witty moments something the more plodding sequels lacked." the military man from the previous movies; Jimmy (Jerrod Carmichael) Cade��s jokey sidekick; and Izabella (Isabela Moner) the obligatory cute kid.

which doesn��t lessen its appeal. The distancing from the real Lewis registers as a commercial calculation as does the emphasis on Maud and Everett��s relationship which here evolves into an achingly moving love story. How much of it is true including that love��s depths remains unclear; certainly the movie deviates sharply in sweep and detail from some accounts most notably Lance Woolaver��s biography ���Maud Lewis: The Heart on the Door.�� Mr. Woolaver has called Lewis��s life desperate and her husband terrible and wrote a book that as he told one interviewer deflates the myth of her ���as a happy little elf in a bright house doing nothing but paint.��" including an opener that engages in some generic place-setting and a pushy score that insistently tries to lighten the darker moods.

She has figured a way out of Aunt Ida��s dominion and straight into a new life." ���Maudie�� vacillates unsteadily between the brute realities of a difficult existence and its palatable imagery. The movie doesn��t erase the hard edges of Lewis��s life. Instead it attenuates them ��� a brutal slap across the face you suspect stands in for more instances of physical abuse ��� and casts many of Maud and Everett��s difficulties as personal ordeals playing down the institutional forces like an orphanage that discreetly hover in the background. There��s an argument to be made against such softening though as Lewis��s work suggests there��s something necessary about the fantasies we make of our lives as we spin beauty and hope from despair." who when the story starts is in her early 30s and struggling to maintain a fragile independence. She��s living with her Aunt Ida (Gabrielle Rose) a dour scold whose opprobrium has seeped into every corner of her house and who enters haggling with a man who proves to be Maud��s brother Charles (Zachary Bennett).

Future pioneers of Hollywood such as the actor-director William Desmond Taylor and the theater entrepreneurs Alexander Pantages and Sid Grauman somehow got their starts in this remote locale. As silent motion pictures became a worldwide attraction Dawson City became the end of the line for film distribution routes. And after a given picture��s run individual distributors balked at paying for return shipment. The town inadvertently came to house a huge film library which was eventually sent floating down the Yukon. Except that is for a portion that was buried for an unusual and arguably hilarious reason." dramas with titles like ���The Unpardonable Sin�� and ���A Stolen Paradise �� suggest a vast unknown film history. They also remind any film scholar that no matter how seemingly voluminous your knowledge of movie history it is likely to be only a fraction of a fraction of the entirety. In any event ���Dawson City�� now enters that time line as an instantaneously recognizable masterpiece." and several hundred other reels of volatile nitrate film from the 1910s and ��20s were discovered decades after they were presumed to be permanently lost. But part of the point of ���Dawson City�� is that the film prints had actually been forgotten ��� buried underground in an era when not much thought was given to their artistic or historical value. The discovery was made in 1978 in Dawson also known as Dawson City a Yukon River town in northwestern Canada. A local man who was clearing a lot with a backhoe suddenly found himself digging up film reels and he paused. The story of the finding unfolds via television news clips from the late 1970s; then Mr. Morrison goes further back using a wide variety of much older footage." the overarching theme is impermanence; his best-known work ���Decasia�� (2002) is an artfully edited assemblage of found footage whose visual appeal is the crumbling of the film emulsion itself. So it��s a bit of a shock that ���Dawson City: Frozen Time�� begins with a brightly colored completely intact clip from a television show about baseball in which Mr. Morrison appears talking to an enthusiastic host about newly discovered footage related to the Black Sox baseball-betting scandal of 1919." and Mr. Morrison takes the opportunity to put together delirious silent-film montages (accompanied by Alex Somers��s evocative modernist score) full of startling visual rhymes. In addition to being filled with as many twists and turns as a first-rate suspense thriller ���Dawson City�� is packed with near-metaphysical intimations both awe-inspiring and humbling. It is in many respects close to a real-life version of Jorge Luis Borges��s great short story ���The Library of Babel.��"

Rather it��s the problem Mr. Shults has set out to investigate with a precision that is all the more unnerving for being fundamentally humane." and both reveal the cruelty behind that impulse. Paul and Sarah are not only struggling to save their family but also to hold onto a civilization ��� a sense of order of dignity of stability ��� that is in the midst of collapsing. If that is it ever really existed in the first place." �� a rigorous and astute film written and directed by Trey Edward Shults plays the outside-in dialectic beautifully. Initially the premise looks like one we��ve seen plenty of times before: An epidemic has wiped out a lot of the population; food and water are scarce; survivors barricade themselves against contamination from the sick and competition from the healthy." the remarkable ���Krisha ��  was a family drama that often felt like a horror movie. ���It Comes at Night�� is the reverse. There are obvious differences of style and tone ��� ���Krisha�� was talky and busy; the new film is taciturn and austere ��� but the director��s preoccupations are as consistent as his sensibility. In both cases people are thrown together in a house by circumstances they don��t control and how they will deal with it all becomes an ethical text with stakes high enough to implicate the audience as well as the characters." in retrospect brutally inevitable. ���It Comes at Night�� is pretty terrifying to sit through but it may be even scarier after it��s over when you sift through what you��ve seen and try to piece together what it may have meant. Travis who is plagued by nightmares tries to do just that and serves as the viewer��s surrogate. His perspective seems to be the only one we can trust and he seems relatively sensitive decent and innocent." the visitors bring complications as well as companionship. There is sexual tension between Travis and Kim and masculine rivalry between Paul and Will. Mistrust simmers and occasionally breaks into the open. The forest meanwhile is full of strange sounds and movements. And the house is full of guns." of course. And while the genre waxes and wanes like the moon over a creepy old house it is unlikely to disappear as long as we have fears that need purging. It��s the nature of those fears that tends to shift over time ��� from the social to the psychological from supernatural evil to human depravity from what��s out there to what��s in here." and Mr. Shults doesn��t jolt the audience with false scares or showy plot twists. He builds up the dread with ruthless efficiency and minimal gimmickry relying on and refreshing some of the oldest techniques in the book. The camera glides down a long dimly lighted corridor. The soundtrack pulses with dissonant chords and heartbeat rhythms. (The score is by Brian McOmber.) Daylight is scarce and shadows are long."

That��s especially the case when Rachel arrives in Britain sweeping into the family manor wearing widow��s weeds and a Mona Lisa smile. The story��s gift and its lever Rachel is the enigmatic perhaps unknowable woman whose ambiguity is at once a kind of freedom (for her at least in part) and a cause for suspicion (for everyone else though chiefly Philip). She quickly pries open both the story and Philip setting loose the emotions that had been straining beneath all the polite manners and smiles the buttoned-up clothing and desires." given the emotional terrain that the director Roger Michell stakes out early with one lovely landscape shot after another the airborne camera sailing over the luxuriant seemingly endless green. All that natural beauty does its part to draw you in as do the tight introductions which Philip narrates with concision over radiant images from his formative years. By the time the story gets going Philip is nearing 25 and in mourning after learning that Ambrose has died abroad. The cause is a tumor although Philip believes the real culprit may be a woman he doesn��t know: Ambrose��s British-Italian wife Rachel (Rachel Weisz)." whose strong narratives flair for ambiguity and Gothic tendencies make her a natural fit for the big screen. Alfred Hitchcock turned her novel ���Rebecca�� into a thriller with Joan Fontaine and a brooding Laurence Olivier. Hitchcock also adapted du Maurier��s story ���The Birds�� (he had less happy results when he took on her novel ���Jamaica Inn��); Nicholas Roeg turned another du Maurier story into ���Don��t Look Now.�� And while an earlier version of ���My Cousin Rachel�� (1952) doesn��t rank alongside these films it does have two perfect stars: Olivia de Havilland and Richard Burton." it is the story of Philip Ashley (Sam Claflin) a callow moist-eyed British gentleman farmer who ��� as he explains in voice-over ��� has been raised without women. Orphaned as a child he has been ushered into a wholly male realm by his guardian Ambrose (also Mr. Claflin) on a swath of land stretching to the coast a rough and wild paradise with thundering horses heaving waves and jagged cliffs that cries out for death and dark poetry." along with sweat and rays of heat lacking in the remake. Mr. Claflin is a lightly attractive presence but here he doesn��t burn; he doesn��t even smolder. And he��s badly outmatched by Ms. Weisz who fluently makes Rachel into a destabilizing force a character whose mystery can make her gracious smiles seem etched in acid. Ms. Weisz consistently pushes the movie deeper but all too often the story returns to Philip so that he can fret swig from a bottle and nurture his paranoia. He��s a mess but not an interesting one. He��s also a puppy as Rachel rightly notes at one point in a film that yaps and nips but never bares its fangs." because there��s a juicy story here that keeps trying to slither out alongside the sexual politics a tale of male sexual innocence that ��� as Philip falls for Rachel ��� becomes a study in male hysteria. Or perhaps that��s not what it is; much depends on whether you believe that Philip is a reliable narrator or one of those dissemblers who��s so good at lying to the world because he��s incapable of telling himself the truth. For the most part Mr. Michell slyly keeps you guessing as to who did what to whom and whether Rachel is a man-killer or a wronged woman or if Philip having been brought up without women has been bred to fear worship and finally hate them." whose films include the romantic comedies ���Notting Hill�� and ���Morning Glory �� and the rather sharper bristling drama ���The Mother �� keeps everything too buttoned-up in ���My Cousin Rachel.�� The new movie looks and sounds quite fine and there��s a certain easy pleasure that comes from revisiting cinematically enhanced 19th-century Britain with its silky frocks perfectly cut posies and apparently happy peasants. It��s all very pretty but too often the movie��s beauty isn��t tethered to deep feeling or strong ideas one reason you may often find your eyes and thoughts drifting away from the quietly escalating drama toward the vast green fields the majestic horses and nice detail work."

But because she is a Mike White heroine she is also complicated sometimes abrasive and not always pleasant to be around. She demonstrates obvious kinship with the characters played by Molly Shannon in ���Year of the Dog�� (which Mr. White wrote and directed) and Laura Dern in the HBO series ���Enlightened�� (which he created). Her righteousness doesn��t make her saintly. It makes her interesting." unfortunately. I don��t mean that something terrible happens but rather that the filmmakers don��t quite succeed in bringing their story to a credible conclusion. But having said that I have to admit that I have no idea what such a thing might look like. ���Beatriz at Dinner�� is about unresolvable contradictions after all which may mean that its failures are less specific than systemic. I don��t blame Mr. White or Mr. Arteta. I blame capitalism. I blame America." a rich and powerful real estate developer with the slightly too on-the-nose name of Doug Strutt.

Small talk is made and decorum is observed until Beatriz figures out who Doug is and decides to confront him." intricate dance. Their commitment to the idiosyncrasy and unpredictability of their characters creates an unusual kind of suspense a slightly uncomfortable kind of increased alertness. Where will this argument go next? How will it end?" �� a new film directed by Miguel Arteta and written by Mike White unflinchingly addresses that question and declines to provide a comforting answer. The setting is a dinner party at a Southern California mansion made awkward by the presence of the title character a massage therapist played with regal composure and understated mischief by Salma Hayek. The differences of background and economic status between Beatriz and her hosts are obvious enough and the film hardly ignores them. But this is neither a simple satire of privilege nor a mock-provocative comedy of diversity and its discontents. It��s about a clash of values about unresolvable contradictions. Or to put it another way about good and evil."

A more interesting movie might have involved a similar struggle within Ahmanet but a more interesting movie was not on anybody��s mind." a label that strikes me as a bit of an exaggeration. Dim Universe would be more accurate with respect both to the murky ugly images and to the intellectual capacities of the script written and conceived by a bunch of people who are capable of better. The old black-and-white Universal horror movies were a mixed bag but they had some imagination. They could be creepy or campy weird or lyrical. ���The Mummy�� gestures ��� or flails ��� in a number of directions but settles into the dreary 21st-century action-blockbuster template.

Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) who is covered with mysterious tattoos and convinced that Nick is her secret lover or the god of death or both. She gets inside his head which is awkward both because he��s kind of sweet on Jenny and because it��s such an empty place. Ahmanet also has a retinue of zombielike minions at her disposal who rampage through England on their way to a meeting with Russell Crowe." but it seems just as likely that those words were lifted from a movie-studio strategy memo. Universal lacking a mighty superhero franchise has gone into its intellectual-property files which are full of venerable monsters and created a commercial agglomeration it calls the Dark Universe. ���The Mummy�� is the first of a slew ��� a swarm? a pestilence? ��� of features reviving those old creatures including the one from the Black Lagoon. We can also look forward to new visits from Frankenstein��s monster and his bride the Wolf Man and the Invisible Man among others." you shouldn��t say anything at all. If I followed that rule I��d be unemployed. But still. There��s no great joy in accentuating the negative. So I will say this in favor of ���The Mummy��: It is 110 minutes long. That is about 20 minutes shorter than ���Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales �� about which I had some unkind things to say a couple of weeks ago. Simple math will tell you how much better this movie is than that one. If you have no choice but to see it ��� a circumstance I have trouble imagining ��� you can start in on your drinking that much sooner." directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser was kind of fun. Monster movies frequently are. This one directed by Alex Kurtzman and starring Tom Cruise is an unholy mess.

During a dinner party Heinrich Himmler the head of the SS (repeatedly identified for the benefit of the unschooled modern audience and played with lurid understatement by Eddie Marsan) halts conversation with an account of new mass-killing techniques currently in the R&D phase. His hosts the exiled German Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer) and his wife (Janet McTeer) are put in an awkward position since they had hoped that their guest would be their ticket back to power." at this stage in his career takes evident delight in the flourishes and extravagances that seniority affords. His Kaiser is full of mischief and vanity in many ways a reprehensible figure but nonetheless able to charm his way out of the contempt he deserves. He might also have deserved a tougher riskier more robust movie but on the evidence here he seems to have made the most of disappointment." a salty eccentric and a vocal anti-Semite ��� though hardly a vulgar genocidal fanatic like Himmler ��� is languishing in a grand house in the Dutch countryside having left his throne in Berlin after his country��s humiliation in the previous world war. He receives daily briefings on military strategy (from a loyal aide played by Ben Daniels) and likes to show visitors his collection of military uniforms. The Empress runs the household with Prussian rigor and dreams of a restoration. Her husband makes some show of sharing her fantasy but seems to prefer splitting logs feeding the ducks and flirting with a pretty young maid named Mieke (Lily James)." some movies have reopened the World War II files ��� especially those parts dealing with the Nazi occupation of Europe and the resistance to it ��� in search of gray areas and moral puzzles rather than black-and-white tales of treachery and heroism. ���The Exception �� a new film based on a novel by Alan Judd circles back to an older tradition. Apart from the swearing the nudity and the nonmarital sex it��s the kind of suspenseful romantic melodrama of awakened conscience that might have been made in Hollywood or Britain in the early years of the war before the worst of its horrors were widely known." and to complicate matters further she is the lover of Captain Brandt (Jai Courtney) a German officer in charge of guarding (and spying on) the Kaiser. The relationship between Mieke and Brandt which begins with a smoldering exchange of glances and moves quickly from there is the center of the film��s intrigue. Is she entrapping him? Is he exploiting her? Are they good-looking people with libidos inflamed by wartime? All of the above?" and for the themes that the movie efficiently directed by David Leveaux from a screenplay by Simon Burke wants to explore. Mieke has already suffered at the hands of the Nazis. Brandt with shrapnel under his skin and nightmares in his head has too. As a German patriot he is conscious of his duty and troubled by the extremism of Hitler and the SS. He detests the local SS heavy (Mark Dexter) a sadistic and humorless true believer. Brandt thinks that atrocities like the one he witnessed during combat in Poland are aberrations and that the German state and the German military are fundamentally honorable and decent. Mieke seeing that he possesses those qualities tries to convince him of his error. ���They are the rule �� she says. ���You are the exception.��" and ���The Exception�� is a diverting and occasionally exciting film though it is rarely disturbing or thought-provoking in ways the material might require. Mieke and Brandt for all their sex and skulduggery are less interesting than the Kaiser himself a marginal player in this historical drama who nonetheless upstages everyone else."

Tatara from the Japanese word for ���furnace �� is the name of the film��s principal setting a rural 16th-century village famous for its ironworks and the craftsmanship of its weaponry. This mountain hamlet is so coveted for its raw materials that it becomes the prize in a turf battle between two warlords." and his battle scenes have a laudably realistic grit with minimal gore.

It��s depressing." TV movies and mini-series over the years and the portraits always hew to the gruff British bulldog conception of this 20th-century leader. ���Churchill �� a new movie directed by Jonathan Teplitzky from a script by Alex von Tunzelmann is laudable in its effort to shine a light on the Churchill who struggled in private with crippling depression ��� ���the black dog �� he called it. His accuracy-in-metaphor was such that sufferers of subsequent generations have frequently adopted the term." choosing to jumble the historical record and frame a Churchill bout with depression against the D-Day invasion of France by Allied forces. While Churchill did express serious reservations about the operation in the weeks before it occurred he was largely reconciled to the plan by the time it happened.

Carmen (Mar�_a Villar) is finishing an arts fellowship in New York; her lover Lukas (Keith Poulson) is also her administrator. As if in a relay Carmen returns to Buenos Aires and urges her friend Camila (Agustina Mu�oz) who��s off to New York on the same fellowship to make sure to touch Lukas��s hair. Camila eventually acts on her friend��s recommendation but this spectacularly enigmatic character also has other agendas including looking up an old lover and meeting her biological father." though Camila is now staying there and receiving them. (This character Dani��lle is played by Mati Diop the intriguing French actress who��s been in films by Claire Denis and Antonio Campos.) All this activity tends to distract Camila from her actual work a Spanish translation of ���A Midsummer Night��s Dream.�� But she never becomes entirely disconnected from that beloved comedy and its life-as-a-dream theme." the Argentine filmmaker Mat�_as Pi�eiro has been making what he calls ���Shakespeareads �� modern-day stories inspired by the playwright��s heroines. Which is not to say that you need to brush up on your Shakespeare to engage with ���Hermia & Helena �� the latest in Mr. Pi�eiro��s series and the first one set in the United States." one both steely and delicate. It is also an often amusing look at the contemporary mating mores of this fair city with Mr. Poulson��s portrayal of a nonchalantly sleazy womanizing hipster milquetoast particularly resonant.

It��s a bit awkward ��� though not unusual ��� for semi-invented characters to brush up against real people. Anthony Michael Hall plays a volatile colleague of McMahon��s who seems to be based on Gen. Michael T. Flynn whose more recent adventures may provide fodder for a sequel. The actual President Obama appears on a television news clip and is played later in a brief scene on an airport tarmac by an actor named Reggie Brown. Ben Kingsley wickedly impersonates Hamid Karzai at the time the president of Afghanistan." but no choirboy either. His attractive qualities of bluntness and loyalty are offset by a propensity for passive-aggressiveness in his dealings with civilian authority and a dogmatic attachment to some pretty dubious ideas. He is convinced that the war can be won and that he is the man who can win it. His hubris would be tragic if his overestimation of his own abilities were not so farcical." �� ���The Operators�� by Michael Hastings is a sharp nuanced deconstruction of the modern military mythology. The book grew out of a notorious Rolling Stone profile of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal who was put in charge of the war in Afghanistan in 2009 and proceeded to blow up his own career. Mr. Hastings who died in 2013 sketched a rollicking damning portrait of a commander in over his head enthralled by his own hype and in less than perfect control of his mouth. That��s the guy Mr. Pitt is supposed to be." �� as its title hints is not entirely about him. Mr. Pitt��s performance is engaging and complicated ��� somehow recalling both the wily and ruthless Aldo Raine of ���Inglourious Basterds�� and the lethally stupid Chad Feldheimer of ���Burn After Reading�� ��� but the film��s most memorable words are none of the jargon that comes out of McMahon��s mouth. In one indelible scene a German member of Parliament (Tilda Swinton) delivers a calm respectful and unsparing demolition of the American position. It is too long and complicated to quote here but in another scene an Afghan villager offers a three-word summary: ���Please leave now.��" but he��s not a bad guy. His judgment can be questioned but not his sincerity. He is beloved by most of the men in his charge and unflinchingly committed to them. Their belief in him is exceeded only by his belief in himself as a legendary larger-than-life figure. Everyone knows that he runs seven miles every morning sleeps four hours a night and eats one meal a day. He his devoted to his wife (a wonderfully sly Meg Tilly) even though as she points out over an anniversary dinner they have spent 30 days in each other��s company over the past eight years." creator of ���Veep�� and director of ���In the Loop �� or the gonzo iconoclasm of David O.

A subplot involves a young marine (Lakeith Stanfield) who questions the strategy he must nonetheless carry out with terrible consequences. But most of the action is far from combat consisting of hushed meetings and heated arguments." but rather that failure to reverse the old saying has a thousand fathers. McMahon clinging to his faith in the dubious doctrines of counterinsurgency chases after an illusory victory that his allies colleagues and bosses don��t really believe in any more. Is he ridiculous or noble? A little of both perhaps." with a neat side part in his hair and a spine as straight as a schooner��s mast Brad Pitt strides into ���War Machine�� in a gust of masculine self-assurance. The sardonic tones of the accompanying narration ��� voiced by someone whose identity will be revealed later on ��� are an early indication that Mr. Pitt may not be the hero of the story. Glen McMahon the four-star general he is playing has no doubts on that score. McMahon a man of many macho nicknames (the Glenimal for example) is a man��s man a soldier��s soldier a warrior with the soul of a poet ��� the walking embodiment of just about every clich� in the book." ���War Machine�� crackles with irreverent wit even if American political craziness circa 2009 looks tame compared with the 2017 version. It takes a while to get going though. A raft of secondary characters is introduced via voice-over but most of them fade into the desert-camo background.

There she raised the children and worked at an art museum while he feathered the nest and rode the Metro-North rails." Ms. Swicord��s ���Wakefield�� is something less than that. The film scrupulously faithful to its source is decidedly literary but not in an especially satisfying way. In its view of suburban discontent and masculine malaise it leans on borrowed insights and an unearned aura of significance. Too mannered for realism and too thin for fable it spins its wheels in a social and intellectual void filled only by Wakefield��s voice-over musings and the shadow of Doctorow��s virtuosity." becoming something of a living poltergeist invisibly haunting the domestic space that had once belonged to him.

The idea of escape ��� specifically the male fantasy of flight from a supposedly female-dominated world of family and responsibility ��� is at least as old as Rip Van Winkle and Doctorow��s text is in part a sly and self-conscious commentary on that literary tradition.

Matthews (the professional wrestler and entertainment hyphenate John Cena) were responding to a distress signal when the sniper struck. Matthews has already been severely wounded and lies unconscious on the other side of the wall. What to do?" Mr. Liman answers the siren song of minimalism with gusto if not complete success. In lieu of flying shrapnel and fancy production design the director ramps the intensity to 11 then breaks the dial.

the chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy at its head and branches out to include Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump. Mr. Stone wasn��t yet 30 when he met Cohn in 1979. (At the time Mr. Stone was helping to run Reagan��s presidential campaign.) Cohn served as Mr. Trump��s lawyer for years and by many accounts assumed the role of mentor. It was Cohn who introduced Mr. Stone to Mr. Trump; Mr. Stone decided that Mr. Trump was presidential material and years later has become identified as one of the president��s outside advisers." the movie offers glimpses of Mr. Stone��s youth including an oft-repeated story about a light-bulb encounter with Barry Goldwater��s book ���The Conscience of a Conservative.�� An ideological true believer is born who backs legal pot and has a few Nixon-theme bongs that he likes to show off along with his other Nixonian paraphernalia. After a brush with Watergate Mr. Stone pokes around here and there; works for both of Ronald Reagan��s presidential campaigns; and helps establish a firm that grew into Black Manafort Stone and Kelly one of a number of companies that earned the nickname ���the torturers�� lobby�� for repping countries condemned as human-rights abusers." be they saints or sinners are often hijacked by their subject so it��s unsurprising that Mr. Stone with his bespoke suits and Nixon tattoo owns this one from the get-go. An energetic tour guide and three-ring circus of one he seems happiest in front of the camera which in turn eagerly laps him up. It��s a familiar interdependency and at times this movie suggests that his most obvious talent is for self-promotion one that��s been aided by the attention of the news media. Among the few journalists who seem to have really gotten under his thick skin was Wayne Barrett an investigative reporter for The Village Voice who died in January." when President Trump fired James Comey the director of the F.B.I. noting his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton��s use of a private email server. Mr. Stone 64 a giddily freewheeling Twitter user greeted this news with a series of tweets including one with a GIF of Mr. Trump stamped ���You��re Fired!�� and another that reads ���Somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling.�� On Wednesday CNN reported that Mr. Stone had recommended that Mr. Trump fire Mr. Comey. The president responded via Twitter:" tracking him from event to event car to home to microphone as when he swans into an outdoor rally during the 2016 Republican National Convention that registers as pro-Trump though perhaps more anti-Clinton. There are signs and people milling about wearing shirts emblazoned with the words ���Hillary for Prison��; for his part the uncharacteristically underdressed Mr. Stone seems almost naked in a T-shirt with Bill Clinton��s smiling likeness and the word ���rape.�� The movie doesn��t at this point identify Alex Jones the radio host and conspiracy theorist (the ���Pizzagate�� hoax) who can be seen hovering at Mr. Stone��s side." this is killer timing for Netflix which is releasing ���Get Me Roger Stone�� on Friday in theaters and via streaming. That��s especially true because in any other year and perhaps under any other administration this documentary ��� the directors are Daniel DiMauro Dylan Bank and Morgan Pehme ��� might have disappeared into the ether. But topicality is all or at least a large part of the movie��s draw. A sometimes illuminating often slapdash and frustrating affair that mixes on-the-scenes bits found material and original interviews (with the likes of Jeffrey Toobin) it opens with Mr. Trump accepting the presidential nomination in July 2016 and ends soon after his election. Much of the rest is a chronological march through Mr. Stone��s life which is studded with scandal and boldfaced names like Roy Cohn." ���Get Me Roger Stone�� will do its part to extend Mr. Stone��s reach and his brand both of which seem as unbounded as he does." unapologetically. In January he published his most recent book ���The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution.�� On Monday Alliance Strategies Group announced that it would ���exclusively represent�� Mr. Stone��s online presence for ���digital advertising opportunities �� adding that he is ���most well-known as President Donald Trump��s confidant and political adviser of over 40 years and often viewed as the architect of the Trump presidential strategy.��" the subject and star of ���Get Me Roger Stone �� struts through this documentary with peacock feathers fully fanned. He��s first heard from a perch in some luxury digs dressed in a tailored chalk-stripe suit with an olive martini at the ready. ���My name is Roger Stone �� he says ���and I��m an agent provocateur.�� The scene suggests James Bond cosplay although it��s worth mentioning that the definition of an agent provocateur isn��t a supercool British fantasy spy but someone who persuades others to do wrong." Jacob Weisberg profiled him in The New Republic (���The State-of-the-Art Washington Sleazeball��) drawing a line from Mr. Stone��s lobbying work to those Reagan aides ��� Lyn Nofziger Michael Deaver Lee Atwater and Ed Rollins ��� who ���have abandoned helping Reagan make conservative ideas reality in order to sell their connections to the highest bidders.�� The journalist Jane Mayer (���Dark Money��) effectively picks up that same thread in the movie when she says ���Lobbying had been considered kind of a sleazy business but Roger Stone unabashedly came out and said ���I��m going to make a pile of money off of this and no apologies.����" who is Mr. Stone persuading? It��s an inevitable question given his relationship with President Trump and how Mr. Stone��s name just keeps popping up in the news churn. In a May 5 article in The New York Times for starters Mr. Stone confirmed that he was one of what the report called ���high-profile Trump campaign associates�� who��d been asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee ���to hand over emails and other records of dealings with Russians as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election.�� Mr. Stone said that he was ���eager indeed anxious to testify in full public session have requested no immunity and am ready to go.��" a careless exasperating decision. Like other documentaries this one crams found footage into punchy montage sequences held together by (not always identified) voice-overs. The problem with this clip-art approach is that it tends to turn history into cultural wallpaper as in the section featuring images of the unnamed Julius and Ethel Rosenberg who ��� with the help of Roy Cohn ��� were executed in 1953 after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage. In other areas the lack of specificity raises questions that remain unanswered as when an image of the Pentagon flashes by without explanation."

a strangely popular subgenre nowadays. Emily��s mom Linda is played by Goldie Hawn who has been funny for a good half-century (going back to ���Laugh-In��) and who is cruelly and inexplicably denied that privilege here. Linda long-divorced and devoted to her two children (Emily��s toxic-nerd brother is played by Ike Barinholtz) functions as an uptight anxious foil to her wildly undisciplined daughter. In principle that may be a slightly stale premise. In practice it��s just dull and it��s frustrating to see Ms. Hawn robbed of the opportunity to be silly." �� Emily Middleton (Amy Schumer) loses her retail job and her rock ��n�� roll boyfriend. Those are the high points of the movie quick and nasty riffs to remind you of ���Trainwreck�� and raise your hopes for something similar. Those hopes are both fulfilled and disappointed." sloppy and witless. ���Snatched�� is one of those movies that subscribes to a dubious homeopathic theory of cultural insensitivity by which the acknowledgment of offensiveness is supposed to prevent anyone from taking offense. The idea is that if you use variations on the phrase ���That��s racist!�� as a punch line a few times nothing else you say or do could possibly be racist. Including say populating your movie with dark-skinned thugs with funny accents and killing a few of them for cheap laughs." Ms. Schumer is committed to consistency or at least to exploiting a successful and familiar persona. She has become more or less what Will Ferrell was a decade and a half ago: the likable embodiment of various forms of human unpleasantness a soft-bodied clown whose immunity to shame represents an appealing kind of innocence. Emily is self-absorbed lazy and rude but also so lacking in true meanness or guile and so dogged in her pursuit of shallow pleasures that she��s kind of fun to be around. Even though she drinks too much says obnoxious things and misbehaves in other ways ��� killing two people for example one with a shovel and the other with a harpoon ��� it��s impossible to get mad at her or even seriously annoyed." and I suppose there��s a certain integrity in blithely refusing to care. It��s also true that comedy can be forgiven for a lot as long as it manages to make you laugh. Which ���Snatched�� did in my case a handful of times including when Emily has a tapeworm and when her brother reaches out to the State Department for help rescuing his mother and sister. But though this movie ostensibly celebrates the spirit of adventure and openness to experience it takes no risks and blazes no trails. It��s ultimately as complacent self-absorbed and clueless as its heroine and not always in an especially amusing way." instead by Mr. Barinholtz by Wanda Sykes and Joan Cusack (as a pair of intense tourists) by Christopher Meloni (as an Amazonian adventurer) and by Bashir Salahuddin (as a State Department bureaucrat).

they��re performed. And they��re all presented by the chameleonic actress Cate Blanchett. More than a performer Ms. Blanchett is also a movie star albeit a very particular caliber of movie star. Which is one of several reasons ���Manifesto�� works as well as it does in cinematic form." 13 readings play out simultaneously on 13 screens challenging the viewer to pluck coherence from an audiovisual Babel of sorts. In the movie version the scenes are laid out in a linear fashion but one scene is divided so that the film begins and ends with it." the words and actions are at odds. For the Fluxus manifesto which denounces hierarchical culture and the elevated position of the artist within that culture Ms. Blanchett vehemently enacts the text in the guise of a temperamental overbearing Russian choreographer. The juxtaposition of words images and settings is sometimes brilliantly comedic as when Ms. Blanchett portraying a big-haired TV news anchor with a smile that looks as if it were enforced by law converses about Conceptual art with a remote weather reporter also played by Ms. Blanchett." but that does not mean they are ineffective. The Dada manifesto announcing the death of art is set at a funeral. Claes Oldenburg��s incantatory brief for pop art (���I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical��) is said as a prayer at the table of a family meal. (That the family is staid and middle-class and Southern tilts to a certain irony however.)" even when the artwork has a strong cinematic element. Julian Rosefeldt��s ���Manifesto �� which originated as an art installation has toured the world recently roosting at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan. It consists of filmed readings of various artistic and political manifestoes dating from Marx and Engels��s 1848 ���Communist Manifesto�� and moving through the 20th century to Dada Fluxus and even Lars von Trier��s Dogme 95 rules for filmmaking." ���Manifesto�� may have seemed like a sensory onslaught. As a movie it��s a very elaborate intellectual exercise immaculate in every technical detail. (The sound design by Fabian Schmidt and Markus Stemler is particularly extraordinary.) And Ms. Blanchett��s work here is aptly cerebral. As virtuosic as her performances are they��re purposely conscious of themselves. As an oblique examination and critique of political and art history and their various interactions over the 20th century ���Manifesto�� is both witty and provocative. It is not however a motion picture for people seeking a plot."

Their banter is interrupted when the couple see a young man deliberately fall into the water.

In the aftermath Lauren is full of admiration: ���You risked your life for a total stranger �� she tells her husband." it turns out is Danny Miller and Tom a criminal psychologist specializing in underage offenders worked with him several years back when Danny was on trial for a bizarre murder ��� a crime he did time for. Now he��s out of prison has been assigned a new name and is very persistent in his attention to both Tom and his parole officer Angela (Tracie Thoms)." who plays Danny makes a meal of a role that zigzags between menacing and pathetic; his intensity and bearing remind me of a young Colin Farrell. Leo Fitzgerald is also excellent as a cultish writing instructor who seems to revel in inappropriate behavior." yes there are a bunch of creepy-stalker tropes we��ve seen before; add to these the plot point that Tom and Lauren are trying to conceive and that Lauren is a visual artist frustrated that her career has stalled. Yet there are intriguing ambiguities at play here. Ms. Gordon frequently keeps her camera (Radium Cheung is the cinematographer) at a remove from the characters using shallow-focus shots in which a foreground or a background object (a hanging lamp a door frame) compromises the ostensible perfection of the composition. This contributes to an unbalanced feel." and how what they do or what they��ve done has changed them.

The person he becomes as a result of his ordeal is as much of a surprise to him as it is to us." with varying degrees of aspiration or hope I suppose to movies that have very little to do with either category. The psychological component is frequently the one more egregiously lacking. ���The Drowning �� directed by Bette Gordon from Stephen Molton and Frank Pugliese��s adaptation of Pat Barker��s 2001 novel ���Border Crossing �� distinguishes itself by applying a depth of psychological observation that yields a genuinely unsettling vision."

Mr. Gunn puts much of his storytelling energy into filling in Quill��s origins after having already dispatched Mom in the first movie. This doesn��t sound promising and isn��t alas despite the good will that Kurt Russell brings to the part of Quill��s father Ego. At one point Mr. Russell or some version of him assays the role with a weird disrupting digital face-lift that��s meant to suggest the young Ego but really only makes you contemplate whether this Benjamin Button-style age-reversing is going to become an increasingly standard (and creepy) industry practice. It��s a distraction that shows a filmmaker making a bad decision mostly it seems because he can afford to." which is the usual blockbuster way. The point is to telegraph the movie you��re about to watch ��� the threats fights and winks followed by more threats fights and winks ��� as well as to reintroduce the crew members their skills traits and foibles. Alternately bulgy and sleek hairy and shticky they make for often-amusing company even if this time Zoe Saldana as Gamora the green-skinned Amazon with grave daddy issues feels more sidelined than before. One problem it seems is that Mr. Gunn is still holding off on developing the romance between her and Peter that was teased in the first movie probably because he��s saving it for the next installment." before Mr. Russell is swallowed up by the story and digital effects he holds you with the laid-back vibe of a Hollywood veteran whose tan and crinkly smile tell you that sunsets and Goldie Hawn are waiting for him back in Cali. He brings an unforced looseness to the movie that it very much needs especially after Mr. Pratt slips into a more sober register in his daddy dearest scenes. Mr. Gunn likes to play a scene straight and then jokingly pull the rug out from under it a trick that among other things helps soft-sell the violence. But the father-son stuff plays flatly less because it��s been told before (like forever) than because he can��t figure out how to playfully kink it up." Mr. Gunn��s ambitions badly backfire. Like the first movie this one is jammed with action-driven sequences some wildly bloated and most of them cartoonish. For one fight though he cranks the music and lets the screen bleed as the ostensible good guys kill one villain after another the casualties falling to the sound of a head-bobbing song. Tonally the episode feels unpleasantly sour and wrong for this young series which is best when it goes light; it��s a bummer watching another director attempt the kind of smiling sadism that not even Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino can always pull off." as it becomes progressively evident is that this series lacks a resonant origin story a myth on which a world multiple stories and a fan base can rest. The Guardians�� personal stories are continuing to emerge and the meme that��s in circulation is family which at times makes it feel as if the movie is taking cues from the ���Fast and Furious�� franchise. This explains the testy at times violent and generally dreary exchanges between Gamora and her sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) a bald badass itching to deliver payback for their rotten childhood. The performers look fierce as they slam around squaring jaws and giving good side-eye but it just feels like narrative filler." Mr. Gunn loses sight of the insouciance and feeling that were crucial to making the first movie work. ���Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2�� certainly has its attractions but most of them are visual rather than narrative. Among the most appealing are the animated diorama-like tableaus that Ego uses to narrate his life each a clue to his character. His private planet meanwhile is a kaleidoscopic fantasia that suggests modestly trippy science-fiction and heavy-metal cover art. This look ��� with its softly clashing colors and soaring stalagmites ��� seems designed to instigate at least in some flashbacks to stacks of yellowing paperbacks and lovingly played rock albums." but for a while Mr. Gunn does a pretty good job of keeping the whole thing reasonably fizzy starting with an opener that winks at the audience with big bangs and slapstick. The movie begins in medias res with Quill and the gang facing down a blobby adversary with fat snapping tentacles and rows of nasty teeth ��� the better to eat them with or just tear them limb from limb. The Guardians take whacks at the blob jumping and thrashing around a patently digital environment that��s vaguely far-out and indeterminate." self-aware waggery of the first. In many respects it��s not much different except it all feels a bit strained as if everyone were trying too hard especially its writer-director James Gunn. Most of the ragtag futuristic fighters who powered through Vol 1. three years ago are back on board and led by Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) a cheerily roguish type who calls himself Star-Lord. The name still brings a light smile even if the movie can��t help but feel as deadly serious as any other lucratively branded Marvel property." the Electric Light Orchestra) the movie��s visual design gestures toward the past but mostly comes across as a generational yearning for such memories. Perhaps like some directors Mr. Gunn fondly or regretfully looks back on a time when studio filmmakers could more or less do their own thing cinematically. Or maybe he just likes songs like ���Come a Little Bit Closer �� a Top 40 hit about a fickle dance partner that works as a nice metaphor for every movie that wants to fall into the audience��s embrace at least on opening weekend. The difference is that while the first ���Guardians�� earned that love as if by accident this one begs for it."

Yet even as the movie is conscientious in its depiction of Beatrice��s and Donatella��s symptoms it winds up doing some effectively fabulist sentimental hedging to support both its societal critique and its female-bonding theme.

�� Laura Poitras��s new documentary was first shown at the Cannes Film Festival last May and has been updated since then. Even so it feels unfinished in a way that is at once fascinating frustrating and entirely understandable. The story Ms. Poitras has to tell is still unfolding and opinions about the person at its center ��� the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange ��� continue to evolve." and not entirely by design ��� the workings of a contemporary personality cult. Mr. Assange who muses on his ���god complex�� and his capacity for martyrdom likes to surround himself with disciples. Fidelity to the message melts into loyalty to the messenger even if the message itself can sound a bit blurry. In one interview Mr. Assange explains the need to balance principles and pragmatism and in another he speaks of the necessity of a global outlook in trying to change the world. But he demurs when asked about the changes he would like to see come about and never arrives at a clear articulation of principle. He insists on transparency while choosing to remain opaque." as it transports the audience back to a recent moment in history that nonetheless seems very far away. From 2010 to 2013 when most of the interviews in ���Risk�� were conducted Mr. Assange emerged as a glamorous and controversial figure a media-savvy and politically astute champion of radical transparency dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct." though not entirely satisfying that ���Risk�� ends in a swirl of confusion. Events since Cannes have upended many of the arguments that the film might have clarified. The pressing empirical questions about Mr. Assange now have to do with the extent and nature of his intervention in the election. Those questions ��� about Russia the F.B.I. and members of the Trump campaign ��� can��t yet be answered by a movie much less a movie review. And the deeper historical and ideological questions that the film poses will also take a long time to work out." not so long ago to be pushing liberal democracy to live up to its potential were actually contributing to its demise?" inserting herself into the story only when it might seem evasive to do otherwise and refraining from passing judgment on Mr. Assange. But any interesting portrait is necessarily the record of a relationship between artist and subject each of whom is invested in controlling the outcome. And to some degree in spite of Ms. Poitras��s journalistic intentions ��� though very much as a consequence of her rigorous honesty ��� the picture that emerges is complicated unsettling and intriguingly ambivalent." Mr. Assange describes the sexual assault allegations against him as the product of a feminist conspiracy. ���Risk�� takes them seriously and sheds light on the ugly thread of misogyny and predation that runs through so much of the tech world ��� in Silicon Valley executive suites as well as in gamer message boards and hacker collectives ��� and that has been dismissed or denied for far too long." which specialized in the highly publicized release of huge troves of classified documents and communications challenged governments and journalistic conventions. The organization and its allies seemed to be on the vanguard of a global movement toward openness and democracy enabled by digital technology and fueled by the idealism and skepticism of an army of hackers." since the filmmaker doesn��t appear on camera and her subject does not exactly exude warmth. But the trust is evident in his candor and in the remarkable access she was granted both in the estate in Norfolk England where Mr. Assange was confined during his period of house arrest and in the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he sought asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden." and so perhaps have perceptions of the digital future. This is partly because the political and media context ��� and indeed the apparent direction of history ��� have changed dramatically. Remember Barack Obama��s first term? Remember the Arab Spring? Remember social media before the trolls and fake-news hucksters took it over?" briefly to that era. It is possible to imagine circumstances ��� a different result in the 2016 presidential election say but not only that ��� in which this movie would be a more or less straightforward prequel to ���Citizenfour �� Ms. Poitras��s Oscar-winning documentary about Edward J. Snowden. That film is in a sense tucked inside ���Risk �� as Ms. Poitras abruptly leaves London where she met with Mr. Assange for Hong Kong summoned by a message from an anonymous whistle-blower who will turn out to be Mr. Snowden. She sees less of Mr. Assange after that and you get the impression that he was not altogether pleased with the shift in the filmmaker��s (and the rest of the world��s) attention away from him."

A couple succeed and one boy eats a bit of melon. The idea presumably is to see whether one child could smash another child��s head in. The ridiculousness of the scene ��� and the melon ��� suggests that Ms. Green believes there��s something absurd about all of this including the desire to know what happened. It also suggests that she lacks compassion.

This is somewhat interesting for 30 or so minutes but grows grindingly obvious as we��re reminded again and again that people have feelings and opinions some dubious." Ms. Green does not obviously engage with her participants but instead lets them talk into the camera. Every so often a performer drifts or rushes into an apparent digression as when one who self-identifies as a ���sex educator �� pulls out a few of his flogging whips and begins twirling them. It��s the kind of moment that another director might have cut. Ms. Green by contrast seems to believe that this moment adds something (outr� humor perhaps) but she doesn��t indicate what it might have to do with the rest of her movie or with the Ramsey case. This forces viewers to fill in the uninteresting blanks using her earlier cues and their own imaginations."

Between the two identities lies a dreadful transformative event; and as the movie toggles from one to the other its writer and director Sarah Adina Smith conjures a storyboard of surreal puzzle pieces that snap together then suddenly split apart. So when a mysterious stranger (DJ Qualls) seems to offer Jonah freedom from his puritanical in-laws and soul-deadening job we somehow know that escape is not on the table." ���Buster��s Mal Heart�� is about the making of a madman. It also aspires with less success to philosophically query the void at the center of modern life and Christianity��s failure to fill it. Religious homilies and paranoid exhortations spill from television sets where cartoons of men trapped in endlessly whirring machines dance dishearteningly. And if the story is too tricky to realize its themes or welcome the impatient it also contains enough empathy to humanize a character who��s part man part spiritual symbol." �� an unkempt vagrant (Rami Malek) wanders the hills of Montana squatting in empty vacation homes and sometimes defecating in the cookware.

I wouldn��t blame readers if this section weren��t the first thing they turned to in their newspapers. It is after all some distance from the obituaries and priorities are priorities. Perhaps they too are inclined to read the obits as soon as possible even to the point of bypassing the front page ��� unless of course it carries a piece about somebody famous who died unexpectedly or not." as the movie asserts a no-brainer for the paper of record to go big and hard with say the 1982 death of the Soviet Communist Party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. But the 2008 death of Betty James who came up with the name Slinky for a toy is just as consequential to the world��s memory and merits substantial if less spacious commentary." Mr. Vitello and fellow obit writers Margalit Fox William Grimes and Douglas Martin are as amusing about as they are amused by some of their subjects whether it was Manson Whitlock one of the last typewriter repairmen who died at 96 in 2013 or Meadowlark Lemon the seemingly indestructible clown prince of the Harlem Globetrotters who died at 83 in 2015. Usually the writers are prepared for these passings with obits prepared in advance. But there are times Michael Jackson��s sudden death in 2009 being one example when they��re not as prepared and both the stakes and the pressure are ramped up." a media consultant who provided vital cosmetic and staging tips to the 1960 Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kennedy before his first televised debate with Richard M. Nixon." vigilant watch over our mortality and an expedient means for us to mark time is to keep up on who among the prominent or even casually known has checked out for good. The second reason is aesthetic preference. I��m not a salaried employee of The New York Times so I��m allowed to say here that some of the finest writing in daily journalism can be found on The Times��s obituary pages. Their consistent quality is an enduring legacy of the paper��s former chief obit writer Alden Whitman (1913-1990) whose thoroughly researched elegantly written biographical essays about the great and near-great between 1964 and 1976 helped set a higher professional standard while enhancing the reputation of a trade once considered a training ground for novice reporters or a vocational graveyard (so to speak) for staff members sliding toward retirement." �� a documentary about The Times��s necrology team at work. Nonetheless her film carries many of Whitman��s virtues and those of his successors. It is modest observant graceful and nonchalantly witty. Beneath bright newsroom lighting cameras peer avidly over the shoulders of writers and editors as they work to meet deadlines assemble facts and obtain perspective on the recently deceased." as has become obligatory in the documentary subgenre ���How The New York Times Does Stuff�� (see ���Wordplay�� from 2006 and ���Page One�� from 2011) ���Obit�� lets us eavesdrop on conferences among the department��s editor William McDonald and his fellow editors Jack Kadden and Peter Keepnews about whose death deserves the Times treatment how much space it should get and where it should be placed." from a gently inquisitive phone call to the bereaved (we hear only his side of the conversation) to the final rush to make deadline is interspersed with scenes of others at work notably Paul Vitello who on that same day is pressed as hard as Mr. Weber to pull together a piece about another 1960s media notable the advertising executive Dick Rich who became an industry legend for his classic TV campaigns for Benson & Hedges cigarettes and Alka-Seltzer." writers and editors at The Times will always have a morgue to rely on a vast archive of articles clipped from past issues of the newspaper. Its custodian Jeff Roth comes across in ���Obit�� as a droll mildly frantic version of a Jorge Luis Borges character holding inscrutable dominion over a vast seemingly impenetrable labyrinth of arcana. One comes away somehow trusting Mr. Roth and his compacted resources far more than the internet. And one comes away from ���Obit�� grateful that the paper has at its disposal a team of humane gifted people who make commemorating the dead a lively lasting art."

Much is made of Berns��s motives in writing with Jerry Ragovoy what would be one of his biggest hits ���Piece of My Heart �� sung by Erma Franklin. Berns would not live to hear Janis Joplin��s version." but the songwriter record producer and music entrepreneur Bert Berns put his fingerprints on a sufficient number of pop and R&B hits in the 1960s to amass a canon that rivals Phil Spector��s. As it happens a new documentary about Berns��s too-short life (he died in 1967 at 38) ���Bang! The Bert Berns Story �� reveals that he resolved to take more control over his music after witnessing Mr. Spector botch one of his songs in a studio session for Atlantic Records." �� written by Phil Medley and Berns (under the name Bert Russell) and Berns was able to rescue it a year after Mr. Spector and the Top Notes�� version this time with the Isley Brothers. The ensuing R&B smash was soon covered by the Beatles and Berns got down to working on both sides of the pond." with narration written by the Berns biographer Joel Selvin (also interviewed here) the documentary packs a lot of showbiz lore into its brisk running time. Did you know that the  Strangeloves�� ��60s hit ���I Want Candy �� of which Berns was a writer and producer (and which was later a New Wave ��80s hit for Bow Wow Wow) got its title from Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg��s best-selling dirty-book parody?" who had a sometimes fraught relationship with Berns turns up and is quite generous in his assessment. The industry legend Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records also a principal in Berns��s own label Bang goes from villain to mentor to villain again. Neil Diamond��s absence becomes highly explicable as the story of his quarrel with Berns unfolds. If you love the music Berns made you��ll love this movie; if you don��t I feel for you but ���Bang!�� might nevertheless entertain with its dish." including much about the intersection of the music business and the mob. As Mr. Selvin bluntly states ���Bert walked with gangsters walked with killers and he exalted them.�� The movie strikes an uneasy balance of romanticizing the connections and making the cleareyed observation that show business and criminality have always had for complicated reasons a close relationship."

but you wouldn��t know it from the film which doesn��t have any of the usual biographical footnoting. (If you see it pay attention to the old couple at the end and then stay for the closing credits.) There isn��t much about the real Mr. Maki in English other than his 1962 fight with the real Davey Moore. Mr. Moore died the next year after sustaining injuries in a brutal fight a tragedy Bob Dylan immortalized in the ballad ���Who Killed Davey Moore?�� I don��t know if a Finnish balladeer ever sang of Mr. Maki but this film serves as a charming testament to him and to the grace of an ordinary life." but ���The Happiest Day�� ��� a largely true story set in Finland in 1962 and shot on glorious black-and-white film ��� is interested in other matters. Olli is about to have the biggest bout of his career against Davey Moore (John Bosco Jr.) an American and the reigning world champion. The fight has been partly coordinated by an ex-fighter Elis (Eero Milonoff) an amusingly oily small-time hustler who��s working every angle he can as fast as he can. Elis is peddling the match as a spectacle a Finnish benchmark. ���You don��t have to go to America to see a great show �� he promises reporters an oath that Olli seems less certain about." nearly to a fault as perhaps befits a fighter known as the Baker of Kokkola a moniker as attractively down-to-earth as this film. ���The Happiest Day�� centers on a boxer facing a personal milestone and training and sparring and sweating (and sweating) to get down his weight. But the director Juho Kuosmanen understands that what happens outside the ring defines a life too so he skips the usual triumphant moments and instead lingers over the big questions ��� the limits of ambition and as the title suggests the meaning of happiness ��� that might be glossed over elsewhere." J-P Passi Mr. Kuosmanen turns the black-and-white from a novelty into a strength using grain and shades of gray to set the mood and tone in smoke-filled rooms and natural landscapes. For the most part the characters ��� Olli most of all ��� don��t express themselves readily or knowingly (they��re pre-therapy). So Mr. Kuosmanen sticks fairly close to them in order to trace those tender telltale filigreed emotions that settle into faces when the words don��t or can��t come. It��s lovely miniaturist work that echoes that of the performers notably that of Ms. Airola and Mr. Lahti who lets you see Olli��s interior life emerge gradually as pure physicality gives way to sensibility." jumpy and fast. He��s a boxer and always moving as if he were constantly getting ready to take a swing or looking out for an opponent. A sweet stealthy story about fighting the good fight in and out of the ring the film opens with Olli (Jarkko Lahti) already in motion. He��s on a train and then in a car listening to twangy rock ��n�� roll (the soundtrack gets your body moving too) while driving to meet his girl Raija (Oona Airola) a radiant beauty who has a heart-skipping way of slowing Olli down." who wrote the script with Mikko Myllylahti layers on scenes of everyday realism ��� two people skipping stones a man on a lonely walk ��� that build an intimate lived-in portrait. Shortly after ���The Happiest Day�� opens Olli and Raija set off for Helsinki where he��ll be training with Elis. It��s the first time that he will fight as a  featherweight a marker that takes on significance as he struggles to make weight. He and Raija have other issues having moved in with Elis his wife and kids a familial squall that (like the tots who pop up now and again) has a way of upstaging important adult matters. Life intrudes as children and the film��s abruptly edited transitions underscore." and if he had any rookie jitters you wouldn��t know it. It��s a bit of a narrative slow-boil ��� the story arrives in pieces in disconnected scenes and conversational fragments ��� but it grabs you right from the start. The most obvious reason is the dense luxuriant black-and-white cinematography which is very pleasurable in its own right. (I��d forgotten how much I missed seeing black-and-white in new movies.) Here the absence of color works like a time machine transporting you into the past yet because it��s now so uncommon it also feels paradoxically fresh not nostalgic."

John Ridley��s wrenchingly humane documentary ���Let It Fall: Los Angeles 1982-1992 �� reveals the Los Angeles riots as the almost inevitable culmination of a decade of heightening racial tensions." Mr. Ridley follows the rise of gang membership and drug use and the troubling evolution of the policing tactic known as ���pain compliance�� (an escalating series of actions designed to subdue a suspect). Neither blame nor absolution entices him as again and again (eased by Colin Rich��s masterly editing) he coaxes forth the perfect shining moment that speaks volumes." �� says Jung Hui Lee a Korean-American shopkeeper whose 18-year-old son Edward Jae Song Lee was mistaken for a looter and shot while trying to protect another business. His death like others in the film is indicative of a chaos that defies a simple black-and-white explanation." this multiethnic oral history allows politicians and the police victims and survivors who witnessed the events of April 29 and 30 1992 to expose a relentless accretion of official decisions and public resentments. We��re almost 90 minutes in before the uprising begins but not a second feels unnecessary: Rather some sections are so powerfully elucidated by the movie��s commitment to context and nuance that even too-familiar tragedies ��� like the agonizing beatings of Rodney King and Reginald Denny ��� arrive freighted with fresh insight."

He��s also no dummy. ���Free Fire�� is an action movie finely tuned to even the most potentially vicious audiences�� tolerances. It is filled with mayhem but avoids grisly violence ��� at least until the finale pulls out some gory and not inapt punch lines." Sharlto Copley and Babou Ceesay are among the idiosyncratic sleazebags doing the selling. The deal is going down in a grungy abandoned warehouse in Boston with Ms. Larson��s character Justine acting as broker. Before things can conclude amicably an unpleasant coincidence-among-lowlifes sets the gangs against each other. All hell breaks loose ebbs breaks loose again and so on." ���All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun �� but it has become a well-known adage anyway ��� because it��s true." �� directed by Ben Wheatley from a script he wrote with Amy Jump applies a more-is-more ethos to the formula: The ingredients here include a best actress Academy Award winner Brie Larson; dozens of firearms; and a slew of male characters of varying levels of smugness and idiocy to help out with the shooting. The film is a formal exercise in spectacle under constraint: An extended standoff in a contained space surprisingly full of hazards." the film also contains no shortage of profane verbal wit: From an impeccably delivered ���Ugh men �� from Ms. Larson to a one-bit gunman��s complaint about hating a certain type of ���freelance job�� that he describes with an expletive."

The ���haves�� are the wealthy Van Peteghems whose patriarch Andr� (Fabrice Luchini) a simpering hunchback presides (after a fashion) over an ominous stone manse on a hill overlooking the bay. The ���have-nots�� are the Bruforts whose own patriarch is nicknamed the Eternal. They run a ferry service in which the Eternal and his oldest son called Ma Loute (also the film��s French title) often hand-carry passengers over a marsh. Sometimes they use a boat. And on these trips they sometimes bludgeon their passengers to death take the bodies to their humble home and eat them." derby-wearing police officers who would look as at home in ���The Adventures of Tintin�� as they might in a Mack Sennett short. One is overweight and makes a lot of noise if he so much as crooks an elbow in his tightfitting suit. He also falls and rolls around a lot. Mr. Dumont is defiantly not above body-shaming humor. He probably has some philosophical rationale for it." the Bruforts are cannibals which among other things puts a crimp in a possible romance between Ma Loute (Brandon Lavieville jug-eared and bad-boy charming) and Billie (Raph who resembles a teenage Natalie Portman) an androgynous cousin of the Van Peteghem girls whose mother Aude (a very hopped-up Juliette Binoche) is also a summer visitor." the human body parts in the Brufort hut grow more numerous. This is a spirited and often gorgeous film (Guillaume Deffontaines the cinematographer makes the eyes of even the most ostensibly unattractive characters supernaturally beautiful) but it��s not an easy one. As it turns out modes of farce and fantasy enable Mr. Dumont to pull the rug out from under the viewer in a number of new and upsetting ways. Be prepared." or at least something like it. Mr. Dumont made his feature debut in 1997 with the striking ���The Life of Jesus �� which built on the unflinching confrontation of emotional extremes pioneered by the filmmaker Maurice Pialat. His subsequent works ��� including the harrowing ���Twentynine Palms �� the enigmatic war film ���Flanders�� and the gloss on Bressonian themes ���Hadewijch�� ��� are serious searing pictures replete with content and imagery that even the most adventurous viewer could find hard to stomach."

Here both the director (Denise Di Novi) and the writer (Christina Hodson) are women yet that doesn��t translate into a reimagining of the tired formula. Tessa and David have a young daughter (Isabella Kai Rice) who becomes a pawn in the deadly game and Julia is given a back story involving an abusive boyfriend but the tale still plays out the same way these yarns always do." because although this is a female-centered movie the women��s roles are not exactly empowering. The formula demands that one character be bonkers and that the other not be smart enough to realize how unhinged her adversary is until it��s too late.

(Mr. Flint is one of the talking heads; Mr. Caro is not.) For the movie��s first half-hour though contemporary interviewees repeatedly evoke the views of Moses and Le Corbusier advocates of a sterile modernism and contrast them with Jacobs��s advocacy of a more organic mode of urban growth. A long time goes by before any specific project is explored." warm and witty; Moses is cocksure occasionally truculent openly contemptuous of the people his big ideas are likely to displace. Defending a project that would have run Fifth Avenue through Washington Square Park he sneers at the ���cabarets and speakeasies�� he plans to raze. Also interesting (and too brief) is a section on the international legacy of Moses: ���China today is Moses on steroids �� the political economist Saskia Sassen notes. A scary thought." I had high hopes for this documentary about two visionaries with diametrically opposed views of how the city and its residents best live. ���Citizen Jane: Battle for the City �� directed by Matt Tyrnauer which chronicles the author and activist Jane Jacobs��s opposition to several ambitious potentially ruinous Robert Moses projects is only intermittently stimulating."

Maybe that��s just because pandas and even the elusive snow leopard have become overexposed with the abundance of nature documentaries these days; this film looks pretty much like any of the best material to be found on the National Geographic Channel PBS��s ���Nature�� and elsewhere." �� another animals-are-just-like-people film from the Disneynature brand has two of the natural world��s more adorable creatures in it pandas and kitties. But some scraggly looking antelopes provide the most impressive imagery in a film that otherwise doesn��t stand out photographically." the narrative read by John Krasinski is kid-friendly in a cloying sort of way and unpleasant realities like China��s pollution are not mentioned. So as an introduction for children to exotic creatures in picturesque landscapes the movie is harmless enough."

he has an old-fashioned belief in cinematic beauty in the charm and necessity of the perfectly lighted and framed face the hauntingly darkened room the grittily coarsened street. He��s a sensualist and in ���The Lost City of Z�� he turns the Amazon into a ravishment for the senses. (The cinematographer Darius Khondji who goes dark brilliantly shot Mr. Gray��s last film ���The Immigrant.��) As Fawcett presses on walking and sailing through dense shadow streaming light and canopies of variegated green the natural world comes fantastically alive with strange animal cries stirring trees roiling fog and frighteningly violent eddies." as does Mr. Gray who fills the screen with intimate reveries and overwhelming spectacle including a harrowing interlude during World War I. Until now Mr. Gray has tended to work on a somewhat modest scale often with art films that play with genre. Here he effortlessly expands his reach as he moves across time and continents and in the process turns the past into a singular life. There��s much to love in this film but what lingers are those lapidary details that often go missing in stories about great men as if they had built the world alone and no child had ever raced down a road waving goodbye as a father disappeared into history." the Age of Discovery is long gone and for the most part so are old-fashioned historical epics other than the occasional Chinese extravaganza or one of those international waxworks with clashing accents. Hollywood used to churn these out regularly but they��ve faded casualties of shifting industry logic audience taste cultural norms and other pressures. The romance of adventure has largely shifted from history to fantasy fiction an easier less contested playground for conquering white heroes." native peoples emerge from those trees by turns watchful threatening and welcoming. Much as he does throughout his Amazonian travels Fawcett is enlivened by his encounters with the Indians. He��s a natural somewhat surprisingly peaceful ambassador given his background and historical moment (even if his restraint also nicely suits Mr. Hunnam��s slow-burning charisma). When his expedition comes under siege at one point he orders his men not to fire and instead waves a kerchief while calling out ���Amigo!�� It��s a stratagem but Fawcett��s curiosity is boundless and he sees accomplishment and complexity in this world which sharply goes against bigoted orthodoxies back home." eventually becoming a kind of steadily devouring fever. He��s hailed as a hero after he returns from his first trip but by the time he��s home he has a new child whose birth he missed. This sets the template for his life as Fawcett increasingly gives himself over to the Amazon and neglects his family a familiar divide that Mr. Gray turns into the story��s axis point. In most movies of this type the great man kisses the little woman goodbye and sets off. Here partly because Fawcett repeatedly returns home Nina emerges as a substantial narrative force and not only a reminder of what he��s willing to sacrifice." �� the writer-director James Gray has set out to make a film in the colonial era that suggests the likes of David Lean��s ���Lawrence of Arabia �� but through a sensitive contemporary lens. It��s one that starts from the premise that while white men have long been the keepers of the historical record they didn��t make the past single-handedly. The story that Mr. Gray has chosen seems an unlikely candidate for such revisionism because it turns on Lieut. Col. Percy Harrison Fawcett who came to believe in the existence of a lost Amazonian civilization. He called it the lost city of Z; others called it El Dorado a European illusion that proved catastrophic for the New World." �� a lush melancholic story of discovery and mystery a mesmerizing Charlie Hunnam plays a British adventurer in the Amazon who is consumed by ���all the glories of exploration �� as Joseph Conrad once wrote of a different journey. Enveloped by the forest the explorer and his crew face snakes piranhas insects and that most terrifying of threats: other people who at times bombard the strangers with arrows. Undaunted he perseveres venturing more deeply into a world that first becomes a passion and then something of a private hallucination. It��s 1906 and while wonders like moving pictures are rapidly shrinking the world the dream of unknown lands endures." working from David Grann��s 2009 book ���The Lost City of Z �� glosses over Fawcett��s more noxious beliefs. Mr. Grann for one writes that Fawcett ���escaped virtually every kind of pathology in the jungle but he could not rid himself of the pernicious disease of race.�� It��s no surprise that the real Fawcett was as fascinatingly contradictory as you might expect of a Victorian-born British explorer. Mr. Gray doesn��t soften all of these uncomfortable edges ��� there is arrogance and tinges of cruelty in this portrait ��� but he��s far more interested in what seems to have distinguished Fawcett namely his passionate belief that Amazonian Indians were not the primitives the West insisted they were." Fawcett is anxious to change his fortunes and increase his social standing. Leaving behind rather too easily his loving wife Nina (Sienna Miller wonderful) and their young son (later played by Tom Holland) he sets off and is soon struggling through the Amazon with a small crew that includes an aide-de-camp Henry Costin (an excellent Robert Pattinson shaggy and almost unrecognizable). Deep in a jungle where each wonder is matched by terror Fawcett is ravaged ��� and then transformed ��� by his discoveries of both a new world and another self."

the reigning poet of the age.) ���A Quiet Passion�� refuses the obvious at every turn. The romantically disappointed recluse of ���The Belle of Amherst �� William Luce��s sturdy sentimental play has been replaced by a prickly funny freethinking intellectual whose life is less a chronicle of withdrawal from the world than a series of explosive engagements with the universe. The passion is not so quiet really. Dickinson muses and ponders yes but she also seethes scolds teases and bursts out laughing." symmetry and ornament ��� that also feels refreshingly plain. The smooth almost lyrical movement of the camera conveys lightness and gravity much in the way that some of Dickinson��s poems do. Like her voice it seems to have been set loose in time to rush forward or to linger as the meaning and the meter require to turn time itself into a series of riddles. The movie lasts for two hours or 37 years or the difference between now and forever or the span of an idea." Mr. Davies pays scrupulous attention to the milieu that fed it. Her formal education complete Dickinson returns to Amherst to live with her parents (Keith Carradine and Joanna Bacon); her brother Austin (Duncan Duff); and her sister Vinnie (Jennifer Ehle). On the way there is a trip to a concert with an uptight aunt who is disgusted by the spectacle of a woman singing and disdainful of music in general. What about hymns? her niece asks. ���Hymns are not music.��" overgrown with wild and exotic talents. That Emily Dickinson was among the most dazzling of these is not disputable but to say that she was obscure in her own time would exaggerate her celebrity. A handful of her poems appeared in print while she was alive (she died in 1886 at 55) but she preferred private rituals of publication carefully writing out her verses and sewing them into booklets." Dickinson was anything but an amateur scribbler approaching her craft with unstinting discipline and tackling mighty themes of death time and eternity. She remains a paradoxical writer: vividly present on the page but at the same time persistently elusive. The more familiar you are with her work the stranger she becomes." but she also naturally submits as her siblings do to their father��s will. When she wants to write late at night she asks his permission noting later that no husband would have granted it. She is submissive and rebellious in ways that defy easy summary. Like the other great American poet of her century Walt Whitman she contradicts herself." �� Terence Davies��s new movie about Dickinson��s life with trepidation. The literalness of film and the creaky conventions of the biopic threaten to dissolve that strangeness to domesticate genius into likable quirkiness. But Mr. Davies whose work often blends public history and private memory possesses a poetic sensibility perfectly suited to his subject and a deep idiosyncratic intuition about what might have made her tick." reciting stanzas instead of voice-over narration and cracking impish sometimes impious jokes with the marvelous Ms. Ehle. A novel of family life writes itself between the lines full of memorable characters and dramatic scenes. Parents grow old and die. Austin marries and then has an affair a transgression that enrages Emily. She and Vinnie seem to exist in precise kinetic counterpoint like the left and right hands of a piano �tude." but she still went.)" another odd duck plying the waters of Massachusetts ��� but so are social and familial ties. The first time we see young Emily (played by Emma Bell) she is about to be kicked out of Mount Holyoke College branded a ���no-hoper�� for her heterodox religious views. The description is wrong of course. (���Hope is the thing with feathers �� she would write.) Her skepticism about God was more personal than metaphysical. She didn��t doubt his existence so much as question his intentions." inward rather than expansive precise in word and gesture ��� it contains multitudes. It opens a window into an era whose political and moral legacies are still with us and illuminates with a practiced portraitist��s sureness of touch the mind of someone who lived completely in her time knowing all the while that she would eventually escape it."

To put it another way: This is a rare Jewish joke in which the punch line lives up to the delivery." Norman is a con artist a spinner of exaggerations half-truths and outright lies. This may be the source of Micha��s affection for him: This future prime minister can produce his share of seductive rhetorical vapor and the men also share an evident and endearing insecurity. They want to be liked to matter not just in public affairs but to the people around them too." captains of industry political big shots in Washington and Tel Aviv ��� might reckon things differently. A rising Israeli politician named Micha Eshel (Lior Ashkenazi) describes Norman to an aide as ���a warm Jew.�� It��s the nicest thing anyone can say.

In his eyes Norman is at best a minor annoyance; at worst a threat to his patron��s career." with the exception of Charlotte Gainsbourg an ethereal embodiment of ethical seriousness and geographical nomadism.)

The naturalistic sound design agrees sifting scrabbling stones and rushing water into the thrumming silence of snow and sand.

Instead he smartly stays focused on Gina Mack and Clark who in different ways are thrown out of their comfort zones by the reception they receive. Countless movies have examined what happens when a country mouse goes to the city; this one shows that leaving a gentrified urban oasis for a small-town world can be just as jolting." �� a mildly comic story about a biracial family that relocates to an exceedingly white town feels a bit out of phase but it��s delicately observed and does a nice job of staying within itself.

Gary Gray (���Straight Outta Compton��) this one opens in Havana where the young local beauties swirling around Dom and Letty move and dress more or less like the other young beauties in the series as if they were part of a continuing global house party this time with Che Guevara and prettily peeling buildings." the movie moves to a dependable blockbuster beat as a little exposition is followed by an action scene and more exposition is followed by a bigger noisier nuttier action scene. As the cars zig and the story line zags these sequences grow baroque defying reason and gravity which have progressively come under siege in this franchise. In New York cars swan-dive off buildings or cut corners like rampaging dogs or outfitted with Bond-like gizmos harpoon a bucking ride. There��s an odd Melville thing going on here: In a Bond-esque battle in Russia that typifies the franchise��s expanded reach a submarine breaches like Moby-Dick." the toys zoomier the stunts more delirious. Yet like every successful series this one delivers its sleek new bits and pieces in reassuringly familiar packaging. James Bond has queen and country. Vin Diesel��s Dominic Toretto ��� the monotonal ���Fast and Furious�� paterfamilias ��� has cars and camaraderie an ideal combo for movies about American outsiders whose home has always been one another."

Julia and her husband are trying to have a child and for a while this plot thread seems an odd way to solicit sympathy for a character who behaves monstrously more than 85 percent of the time. As it happens the filmmakers have something quite a bit more grim up their sleeves. The variable incongruities of ���Glory�� give it a queasy power uncommon in contemporary cinema.

and as confusion gives way to a realization of what��s happening they adjust. Mitsuha delighted to find herself sometimes living in Tokyo adapts surprisingly well to Taki��s body and especially his habit of visiting cafes (where she gorges on sweets spending his money). There are tricky moments too like her unexpected chaste flirtation with Taki��s female co-worker who warms to his new ���feminine�� side. Other than Taki��s borrowed breasts (which he continues to enjoy in vaguely onanistic fashion) he mostly goes with the flow when he��s in Mitsuha��s body sometimes with messy hair and manspreading." �� a wistfully lovely Japanese tale about fate and time that its two teenage characters meet. By that point Mitsuha (a girl yearning to leave her small town) and Taki (a boy in Tokyo) have come to know each other as well as two people can. For reasons they don��t understand each��s consciousness has been temporarily jumping into the other��s physical shell only to jump back. This happens at night which means that Mitsuha regularly wakes up in Taki��s body and he wakes up in hers a swap that he likes to confirm by fondling his (her) breasts." if Mr. Shinkai finally plays it safe about what it means for an adolescent boy and girl to trade bodies and lightly toy with gender he complicates the story in other ways. Gradually elements that at first seem like contextual details ��� a Shinto temple; a racing comet; and a traditional sake called kuchikamizake fermented with the spit of a virgin ��� shift from background to foreground becoming part of the body-switching story. It��s a narrative progression that at certain moments is echoed by the actual animation as when the smudged watercolorlike landscapes movingly overwhelm the cartoonish forms of Mitsuha and Taki." and why Mr. Shinkai has set another change in motion and ���Your Name�� has shifted from a comedy of confusion into a deeply moving meditation on nation history catastrophe and memory. It��s a touching soaring switcheroo one that Mr. Shinkai achieves with help from Masayoshi Tanaka who did the character design and Masashi Ando the animation director and a veteran of Studio Ghibli. ���Your Name�� is being released in the United States in Japanese ��� Ryunosuke Kamiki voices Taki; Mone Kamishiraishi voices Mitsuha ��� and in an English dub. If possible stick with the original." which is understandable given the trippy complications conceived by the film��s writer-director Makoto Shinkai. ���Your Name�� is a body switching story but it��s also about tradition and impermanence disasters and destinies. For Mitsuha and Taki there are other more immediate concerns like being profoundly alienated from the body each is actually inhabiting which of course is another way to describe adolescence (and other maladies). The story opens just as Mitsuha awakens ��� or rather her physical body does ��� and a shocked Taki realizes that he��s crossed over an inexplicable rainbow. Meanwhile back at his home in Tokyo a horrified Mitsuha now somehow in this boy��s body registers that he/she has to use the bathroom." it��s about as clean a scene as it gets partly because Taki is an anime character which means that there��s a cartoonish quality to how his enormous jewel-like eyes widen and how patches of red bloom on his smooth cheeks. He��s embarrassed and while you may laugh ��� in sympathy in recognition or just because it��s a funny setup ��� his familiar anime look his pert nose and pointy chin as well as some of his expressions put distance between you and him. The beauty of ���Your Name�� is that as in the best animated movies the thin black lines of the character design invariably dissolve and all that remains are Taki and Mitsuha thoroughly mixed-up teenagers." some malevolent and others benign and ranging from science-fiction freakouts to Disney staples like ���Freaky Friday �� about a girl and a mother swapping bodies and problems. A lot of these stories skew comic (body anxiety can be good for giggles) and they usually involve an outrageous exchange that turns into an exercise in radical empathy: Two people trade places and each is forced to experience what the other does and feels. In a sense this kind of swap even at its goofiest evokes the transporting process of the fictional experience as we ��� viewers readers and gamers ��� temporarily inhabit another being��s consciousness."

a father whose heavy investment in his daughter��s success seems both laudable and a little frightening. For Romeo a doctor in a provincial Romanian city Eliza (Maria Dragus) ��� his only child in her last year of high school ��� represents his only basket and all the eggs inside. He clings to the faith that his thwarted ambition his battered idealism and his dented self-esteem will all be vindicated if Eliza wins a competitive scholarship to study in England. He and his depressive wife Magda (Lia Bugnar) who lived in exile before their return to Romania after the end of Communism are not up to leaving again. Eliza��s escape would be an antidote to her father��s disappointment with the spiritually and morally desolate place his country has become." he ventures into the world of favor-trading and back-scratching that he had always disdained turning to a high-ranking police officer (Vlad Ivanov a guarantor of Romanian cinematic authenticity) and a local politician (Petre Ciubotaru) in an effort to rig Eliza��s test scores. He tries to convince himself (and his accomplices are happy to assure him) that it��s all no big deal just the way things are done." 3 Weeks and 2 Days��; a fatal exorcism in ���Beyond the Hills�� ��� the predicament of Romeo and his family might seem trivial. But Mr. Mungiu one of the crucial figures in the post-dictatorship flowering of Romanian cinema has a gift for infusing daily routines with an almost metaphysical sense of dread. Mr. Titieni a heavy serious presence with palpable kindness in his features makes us believe that nothing less than Romeo��s soul is at stake. And Ms. Dragus who slowly takes possession of the film��s moral center beautifully dramatizes the dilemma of a child who wants to be both obedient and independent. Romeo��s dreams for Eliza are rived with contradiction: He wants her to be free but never imagined that she would want to free herself from him." a rigorously naturalistic film that at times feels as claustrophobic and suspenseful as a horror movie. Like Mr. Mungiu��s other work it is a thriller of sorts built around an excruciating ethical problem. He is unstinting in his sympathy and unsparing in his judgment. Romeo is a decent man but his belief in his own decency is a toxic kind of vanity. His actions don��t so much make him a hypocrite as reveal him to be yet another of the clueless puffed-up patriarchs who afflict Romanian cinema (and not only that of course). And also for all his sins a pretty good dad." �� Cristian Mungiu��s nerve-racking and humane new film provides plenty of visual and narrative evidence in support of Romeo��s pessimism. Mr. Mungiu��s camera stalks Romeo through a drab landscape where ugly old buildings are falling down and ugly new ones are going up where gray and brown are the dominant colors and where nothing quite works. When Eliza is attacked ��� she injures her arm fighting off an attempted rape ��� her father��s worst intuitions are confirmed. But his plans are also threatened since the trauma of the assault threatens to affect her performance on a crucial exam. She is also seeing a boy Romeo doesn��t much like.

http://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/movies/their-finest-review.html
the movie tells a story of familiar British grit and resolve during World War II from an attractively different angle: that of an advertising copywriter Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton) who��s recruited by the government to join the film industry. Britain wants the United States to enter the war and has decided cinematic propaganda is the way it can persuade the movie-mad Yanks to sign up. The world is facing a historic catastrophe after all; but for this ambitious young woman it��s also a bittersweet opportunity." people also just lived their lives sometimes with laughter and unexpected new freedoms as in John Boorman��s 1987 autobiographical film ���Hope and Glory �� about childhood during the Blitz. The director of ���Their Finest �� Lone Scherfig is Danish (her breakthrough was ���Italian for Beginners��) but she has carved out a curious niche making British period stories most notably ���An Education.�� She has fine timing and wit ��� the behind-the-scenes filmmaking sections in ���Their Finest�� are delightful note-perfect sendups ��� and while her visuals tend to be overly buffed she��s more ambitious with her performers who retain their rough human edges." Catrin is paired with Tom Buckley (Sam Claflin) a dyspeptic screenwriter who nonetheless grasps her talent. With British men off fighting the Nazis the domestic film industry needs all the help it can get even if this means deviating from its entrenched sexism. For Catrin who��s shacked up in a bleak London flat with her husband Ellis (Jack Huston) the new career and its opportunities are as welcome as the pay. La vie boh��me doesn��t seem to be cutting it especially because Ellis ��� a struggling painter given to slashing cluttered canvases in shades of dung (the movie is clearly on the side of the popular arts) ��� insists on stirring up trouble." a few others muscle into the boys�� club including Phyl (Rachael Stirling) a dispenser of feminist truths in slacks. The character who most beautifully embodies the story��s ideals though is Sophie (Helen McCrory) who as a talent agent brings man and dog to heel in a few short barbed scenes. She��s the kind of no-nonsense woman you can imagine contributed to the real war effort including in the film industry. ���Their Finest�� is too understandably serious to be called a romp yet it has a buoyancy that lifts you and in Ms. McCrory a woman who does too." somewhat stolid presence Ms. Arterton nonetheless manages mostly through sheer screen time to create a character who can hold her own against these free-ranging peacocks none prouder and screechier than Buckley a romantic foil whose sourness Mr. Claflin keeps in check with glints of soul. It��s an alluring performance pitched between leathery guardedness and vulnerability and spiked with the genial self-abnegation that defined Hugh Grant��s early career. Mr. Claflin could have run off with ���Their Finest �� except that he��s just one in a gang of wily thieves who include Eddie Marsan Jeremy Irons Jake Lacy Richard E. Grant (king of the reaction shots) and that sly puss Bill Nighy as a faded star in permanent high dudgeon over his career." ���Their Finest�� settles into focus once Catrin and Buckley start working on a film intended to rally the United States to the cause. Initially assigned to writing ���the slop �� or women��s dialogue Catrin quickly rises to the occasion typing reams of dialogue while gracefully sometimes messily navigating a crowd of tetchy narcissists mostly male. Even with so many men away at war Catrin is outnumbered at work which makes sense given the film industry. Yet partly because ���Their Finest�� is so wonderfully cast both Ms. Arterton and her character often come close to being upstaged by their scene-stealing male cohort a somewhat perilous turn for a female-driven story about a woman finding herself and her voice."

(The heroine like the protagonist of Mr. Lean��s ���Lawrence of Arabia �� is shown in the Nafud Desert the site of ���the sun��s anvil�� in that great 1962 film.) T. E. Lawrence himself appears; he is played in a winking turn by Robert Pattinson who can be seen to even better effect ��� in the same period ��� in James Gray��s coming ���The Lost City of Z.��" and it��s tempting to knock ���Queen of the Desert�� for not being ���Aguirre the Wrath of God�� or ���Fitzcarraldo.�� The movie written and directed by Werner Herzog was largely dismissed when it played at the Berlin Film Festival in 2015 and is only now opening in the United States." which include attempts to make inroads with the Bedouins and the Druse and (eventually) advising the British on the carving up of the Middle East. Bell is embodied in a commanding and versatile performance by Nicole Kidman who supplies a gravitas and emotional complexity worthy of the woman she plays." the British adventurer archaeologist and linguist who has been labeled the female Lawrence of Arabia. (One of her less couth colleagues in the film calls her a ���chattering windbag of conceited gushing heavy-chested man-woman.��)" there are respects in which he improves on them. He has cast Arab actors in Arab roles a change from the practice in Mr. Lean��s era. And unlike Mr. Lean he doesn��t sentimentalize the landscape which is not to say that ���Queen of the Desert�� is an ugly film. Even the stodgiest biopic would be redeemed by Mr. Herzog��s eye. The shots that track Bell into her meetings with Arab leaders may have you catching your breath." surprisingly credible as a dashing Brit). In one of the few moments that smacks of true Herzogian weirdness Mr. Franco��s character takes Bell to the top of a tower where human remains have been left and asks to kiss her in front of a vulture. By the time Bell��s affections turn to a married miliary officer (Damian Lewis) the movie has abandoned most of its eccentricities." Mr. Herzog can seem as driven and half-mad as his characters.

Both play ingeniously against type but while she is an anti-princess from the start ��� with some of the thrilling unpleasantness that galvanized ���Rachel Getting Married�� ��� he takes his nice-guy persona and turns it inside out. His affable detachment which has made him a reliable if not always memorable performer slowly gives way to something darker stranger and more interesting." you might mistake ���Colossal�� for a certain kind of diffident funny-sad exasperating drama. The kind in which a youngish adult bruised by bad luck and bad decisions returns to a hometown awash in nostalgia and old friends. Romance and rue gray skies and dead leaves whispery song lyrics over sensitively strummed guitars on the soundtrack.

Inside each of us is a colossus with the power to smash everything to pieces." by no means all of it monster-related ��� from its blithely bizarre conceit." �� but it shares that movie��s interest in using horror movie tropes to unlock heavily defended areas of social unease. Starting out as the portrait of an irresponsible woman ���Colossal�� turns into a critique of male self-pity as Gloria��s problems collide with and are overwhelmed by Oscar��s sense of aggrieved entitlement." and they catch up at the attractively run-down bar he inherited. He gives her a job but mostly they hang out after closing time depleting the liquid inventory with the help of a couple of other familiar small-town indie-movie types: the bitter wiseacre (Tim Blake Nelson) and the sexy dimwit (Austin Stowell). Like I said: romance and rue with Life Lessons and Second Chances in the forecast." Nacho Vigalondo the writer and director of ���Colossal �� has a different kind of horror in store for us and for his train-wreck heroine an unemployed ���internet writer�� named Gloria. Played by Anne Hathaway with heavy bangs and a blunt disavowal of her own charm Gloria has a taste for alcohol and an aversion to honesty. When her fed-up British boyfriend (Dan Stevens) throws her out of the New York apartment they have been sharing she crawls back to the house of her (conveniently absent) parents in some generically semi-picturesque American place. Her pity party is interrupted by Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) who pulls up in his pickup truck and offers a ride down memory lane." I��m reluctant to say though the movie is to some extent spoiler-proofed by its loose make-it-up-as-we-go-along structure. A giant lizardlike creature ��� a kaiju if you insist ��� is terrorizing Seoul halfway around the world from wherever Oscar and Gloria are. Eventually it will battle a giant robot. What this has to do with two self-absorbed Americans is at first baffling then intriguing and finally obvious. Which doesn��t ruin anything.

Directed by Laurent Bouzereau ���Five Came Back�� will be shown theatrically in New York and Los Angeles starting Friday when it also begins streaming on Netflix." ���Five Came Back�� is an invitation to see more: It��s hard to watch it without wanting to visit (or revisit) Wyler��s ���Mrs. Miniver�� or Ford��s ���They Were Expendable.�� It��s further proof if any were needed that these men weren��t simply creating propaganda but art that would endure." the shots that might most catch your eye are Stevens��s extraordinary images of the liberated streets of France and of the horrors of the Dachau concentration camp. His subsequent film version of ���The Diary of Anne Frank�� (1959) sometimes ridiculed for its counterintuitive use of CinemaScope and the casting of the model Millie Perkins may be the movie that gains most in retroactive inflections." the 2014 book ���Five Came Back �� by the journalist Mark Harris is an extraordinarily detailed account of how the men brought the war home for viewers. Still it has a problem endemic to film books: It lacks clips." this chronological series takes the gambit of having each director��s story relayed by a contemporary counterpart.

Paul Greengrass no stranger to drama in the air (���United 93��) or on the sea (���Captain Phillips��) seems to understand Ford intuitively. Of Ford��s documentary ���The Battle of Midway�� (1942) he notes the dangerousness of the camera placement and moments when violence visibly distresses the image. Francis Ford Coppola defends John Huston��s use of staging in ���The Battle of San Pietro�� (1945) as potentially capturing the essence of the situation more completely than straight documenting might have." whose own movies share obvious affinities with those of Frank Capra and John Ford is the surrogate for William Wyler. Mr. Spielberg��s eye is one of the series�� strongest assets: He extols the aerial photography in ���The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress�� (1944) an account of a B-17 bomber��s mission and later notes how Wyler avoided camera motion until a crucial scene in ���The Best Years of Our Lives�� (1946) one of several postwar films held up as examples of how the directors�� experiences overseas transformed their movies." George Stevens whose story is told by Lawrence Kasdan arguably has the spottiest critical reputation and he vanishes for long stretches of ���Five Came Back�� until his teaming with John Ford to film the D-Day invasion."

���The Blackcoat��s Daughter�� bewitches with silky-smooth camera movements and a rolling reverberating musical score (by Elvis Perkins the director��s brother). Yes it��s a horror movie (the murder scenes suggest that the director has watched ���Psycho�� more than once) but even its most brutal acts pulse with inchoate sadness. Deceptively simple scenes ��� like a stunning slow-motion shot of Rose posing for her school photograph ��� insinuate a wealth of information but the movie doesn��t hanker to be understood. It just wants your surrender." Kat (Kiernan Shipka all grown up from her role as Sally Draper in ���Mad Men��) and Rose (Lucy Boynton) are left alone during midterm break. Neither set of parents for reasons not immediately clear has arrived to pick them up and their only company is two strange female teachers. In another location ��� and perhaps another timeline ��� a third girl (Emma Roberts) who may have escaped from a mental hospital is given a ride by a grieving couple (James Remar and Lauren Holly). All three narratives will converge but not before a great deal of blood has been spilled." ���The Blackcoat��s Daughter�� is a stealth weapon. Slow and seductive and deliberately vague this deeply unsettling tale of lost parents and troubled daughters exudes atmosphere while hoarding facts. Yet the movie is so perfectly acted and gorgeously filmed (the cinematographer is Julie Kirkwood) that we don��t mind its coyness; the twanging notes of trepidation make us almost grateful for the leisurely build."

He knew no other life save that of king. Mr. Serra��s depiction of the monarch��s final days shows a mostly bedridden Louis keeping to his dimly lit ornately appointed bedroom. Bedecked in elaborate clothing and ridiculously oversize hairpieces he is initially in a relatively content state. He gossips and indulges in what some might call mild locker-room talk with his doctors asking one whether a certain marquise is beautiful naked. This state doesn��t last. He has night sweats; he calls for water; when water is brought to him he demands that it be served in a particular piece of crystal. It was perhaps once good to be the king; now it��s confusing. And it will get worse before he gives up the ghost." who has been a star of French cinema for most of his life (at 13 he created the character of Antoine Doinel in Fran�_ois Truffaut��s 1959 classic ���The 400 Blows��) clearly knows something about living in a kind of box and he plays Louis as a tired but majestic wreck.

The new ���Ghost in the Shell�� was directed by Rupert Sanders who has made commercials and one other feature ���Snow White and the Huntsman.�� He likes a dark palette and is good with actors but there��s little here that feels personal and he mostly functions as a blockbuster traffic cop managing all the busily moving conspicuously pricey parts." of course is Ms. Johansson whose mysterioso cyborg Major effortlessly slides right into this scene with her preternaturally still face ��� often as blank as a mask ��� and the ports in the back of her neck that she uses to jack into cables and other characters. These artificial orifices are pleasingly mysterious and highly suggestive at once creating a sense of human vulnerability and raising the possibility of the posthuman. Major occasionally stuffs goo in her ports and also uses them to plug into others. About the only part of her that��s human is her soul or ���ghost�� in the story��s poetic parlance. The rest of Major is a bendable mendable shell which makes her well suited for hard-core tactical work with a police outfit known as Section 9." inventive images in this visually cluttered yet often disappointingly drab movie. A live-action version of a famed Japanese manga by Shirow Masamune ���Ghost in the Shell�� is one of those future-shock stories that edges around the dystopian without going full-bore apocalyptic. To that end it is set in a possible future world that looks distant enough to seem exotic and familiar enough to seem plausible.

Some of this tickles the eye like the semi-translucent pony-size koi fish that float through the air seemingly just because they look cool. The koi don��t seem to be selling anything other than the movie��s production values and visual concept; elsewhere enormous spectral human figures loom over buildings like embodied billboards nicely evoking rampaging movie monsters of the past." presumably because they��re beyond mere language and in any event they sometimes communicate telepathically. At first the fact that they can speak to one another comes across as an inventive flourish but like so much in ���Ghost in the Shell�� ��� the toddling geishas the Asian extras ��� it helps to reduce an entire culture to a decorative detail. The movie has been widely criticized for casting Ms. Johansson in a role that was of course originally Japanese a decision that isn��t offset by an absurd narrative twist that seems to have been created to forestall criticism but will only provoke further ire. This isn��t just appropriation; it��s obliteration." especially because the original ���Ghost in the Shell�� is such a delightful philosophical plaything with pleasures that simultaneously bewitch the eye and enchant the mind. This version by contrast ditches the original��s big human all-too-human questions but keeps all the firing guns and car chases the action clich�s and intentional genre stereotypes. Stripped of its deeper-dish musings the story turns into a perfectly watchable somewhat bland action movie tricked out with sharp details some fine actors and one slumming legend the director-actor Takeshi Kitano who plays Aramaki Major��s boss. He only speaks in Japanese; Major and almost everyone else speak in English." Scarlett Johansson rises above it all. In the thrill-free science-fiction thriller ���Ghost in the Shell �� her character comes at you in pieces emerging first during the opening credits in the form of a metallic skeleton. It��s a good look ��� it evokes the original Terminator ��� but soon the skeleton is being dipped like a chip in whitish goo.

but Mr. Malick��s visual choices also give the film a commercial luster that can rob that beauty of its power. That��s partly because the advertising world and mainstream cinema have long pilfered his aesthetic turning it into a sales pitch. Mr. Malick is enraptured with beauty as an expression of God and as a path to God. But in ���Song to Song�� both the familiarity of his aesthetic and the inability of some of his actors to summon an inner light create immaculately photographed surfaces rather than immanence. You see the poses not the divine." joyful moments shared by Faye Cook and BV; by the final section Faye is stepping once more into a natural pool of water challenging Heraclitus��s observation that you cannot step into the same river twice (life changes). Throughout Mr. Malick inserts shots and short scenes that seem more like shards of memory like those flashes from the past that suddenly materialize in the temporal slipstream. Faye and Cook gaze at each other warily; Faye and BV embrace; Faye and Cook embrace; at one point all three fly off in a private plane to Mexico where they cavort on a beach wander around and get drunk amid a relay of looks." even if there��s also much here that��s exhilarating including the film��s ambitions and its seriousness. Seriousness in cinema is often viewed with suspicion and that��s as true now as it was when say Antonioni shook up the art. The difference is that now seriousness (and beauty and grace) is rarely part of a wider discussion because that conversation is dominated by corporate cinema where there��s often little to argue over and get excited by. There is by contrast much to admire in ���Song to Song�� and much to argue with including its ideas about pleasure and women. So go fall into its embrace resist its charms argue. This may not be a film to love but it is a film to see." the kind of astonishing inner truth ��� call it a fever or call it grace passion or holiness ��� effortlessly expressed by Ms. Smith and manifest in Leonardo��s Madonna. Mr. Malick��s filmmaking with its storytelling ellipses and visual fragments places a heavy burden on his performers who need to build their characters primarily through individual voice-overs and in onscreen silence or near-silence in gestures and movement. Mr. Fassbender does this brilliantly; too often Ms. Mara and Mr. Gosling seem to be running through different acting exercises." including the film��s narrative fragmentation which requires you to go with the flow as you also puzzle together the story��s parts themes and circling characters: Faye (Rooney Mara) a musician trying to find her way in Austin Tex.; Cook (Michael Fassbender) a music producer and Faye��s sometime lover; and BV (Ryan Gosling) a musician and Faye��s other lover. A few other lovelies float in as well including Rhonda (a moving Natalie Portman) a waitress who marries Cook; Amanda (Cate Blanchett) who has an affair with BV; and Zoey (B�r�nice Marlohe) who has an affair with Faye. Holly Hunter Iggy Pop Johnny Rotten and Val Kilmer also drop in." a sentiment that Mr. Malick seems to share. It��s a beautiful seductive show an endless carnival (with little actual work or sweat) filled with jostling occasionally colliding bodies that ��� whether playing onstage thrashing in a mosh pit or seductively grinding on the floor ��� seem to be reaching reaching always reaching for something beyond these earthly fleeting sensual delights. As in Mr. Malick��s 2016 film ���Knight of Cups�� (about a screenwriter) sex and especially sex without love inevitably proves to be a crucial false promise a temptation that leads to suffering cascading tears and sometimes catastrophic even fatal falls." �� the latest from Terrence Malick is of ripples expanding across a small pool of water echoes of a woman��s quick step. Mr. Malick one of cinema��s philosopher kings embraces fluidity as a visual principle and his films are filled with life��s ebb and flow ��� its swirling waters swooping birds stirring trees billowing curtains and gliding people and cameras. He loves silence and stillness and the image of sunlight caressing a woman��s motionless face. But he is a searcher and that searching informs his visual style with its restless moving pictures." play turns into a rehearsal for a possible future that��s telegraphed by a baby whom BV holds in one scene and by a tiny elderly woman trembling alone in another scene. Cook also speaks in muted voice-over about Faye and BV as if telling himself a story. ���They have a beauty in their life �� he murmurs ���that makes me ugly.�� You have to take his word for it because there��s very little here that��s intentionally ugly in ���Song to Song.�� Ugliness hovers like a threat but is often only inadvertently conveyed as when the film reduces Mexicans to touristic props. Cook by contrast just seems like a rich bored henhouse fox who throws parties where women wait to be chosen and where one lies on a table like a centerpiece food covering her naked body." employing three or four acts story beats and character arcs that are so standard you almost intuitively know when something will happen if not what. There will be a crisis; there will be a tidying up. ���Song to Song�� has distinct sections but Mr. Malick frames them his own way. They move the narrative forward but inside these sections time can seem to stutter like a song on repeat. Many scenes are so short that they don��t seem to be overtly driving the story forward but instead pile up and nearly swirl like leaves caught in a gust." from love (always love) to fidelity betrayal identity art freedom captivity forgiveness and mercy. God is there too in nature and in the glowing streaming sunlight but also in a Madonna painted on the side of a building and in a Leonardo drawing of the Virgin Mary. The Leonardo shows up in a scene with Patti Smith who plays herself (St. Patti) and compares Mary��s face to Faye��s. Ms. Smith tears a hole in the film because she��s so thrillingly present so alive; playing against Ms. Smith Ms. Mara seems lost and she just disappears poof like a snuffed-out candle."

Mr. Boyle wisely doesn��t try to surpass or even repeat the mad frenetic rhythms of the original. Gone is the druggy propulsiveness the ecstasy of the high that injected such improbable joy into those wretched long-ago lives.

His rant is hilarious the patter rapid and twisted and defiantly exuberantly Scots. (The script is once again by John Hodge drawing from the novels of Irvine Welsh.)

Kyoko seems befuddled by her own resentments and prospects for the future.

At crucial moments this mostly black-and-white film breaks into color. The first blush occurs when Adrien mentions Frantz��s favorite canvas a Manet painting of a man with his head thrown back. When that work is finally shown it depicts a young man��s suicide. By the time Adrien returns to Paris he and Anna have developed a deep unvoiced attraction." ���Frantz�� is low-key. It doesn��t rub your face in gore or stir your adrenaline; there are no battle scenes and only fleeting images of ruined cities and wounded soldiers; and a mood of bitterness despair and exhaustion prevails. The movie even goes out of its way to evoke the cultural similarity of two warring nations geographical neighbors who appreciated the same music and art. Parallel scenes show Germans and Frenchmen bellowing patriotic anthems even after the Armistice." �� with Anna assuming center stage and the movie taking on the tone of an Alfred Hitchcock mystery. After one of her letters to Adrien is returned without a forwarding address she boards a train to Paris hoping to find him. As if shedding a skin the film shucks off its elegiac white-gloved manners to explore a slippery realm of secrets lies and moral uncertainty that eventually leads her to consult a priest for advice on how to proceed. The scene poses profound questions about honesty and the possibility for redemption if the truth is withheld." ���Humankind cannot bear very much reality.�� That might be amended substituting ���the truth�� for reality." but Hans resists accepting him. ���Every Frenchman is my son��s murderer �� he declares then softens when Adrien tells him about his and Frantz��s long walks and museum visits their shared pacifism and tastes in music and poetry.

(This is the best career Mr. Khaitan could dream up for his heroine?) Badrinath turns up in Singapore too and it��s on this non-Indian ground that the movie hammers home its point: A real man is one who respects women or in his case learns to.

Maureen a young American woman living in France belongs to a relatively privileged slice of the international nomad class. The old-fashioned term ���jet set �� with its connotations of glamorous indolence doesn��t quite fit.

All of these seem far away from the life he has come to live as a tidy proper and emotionally detached camera shop owner mostly in the company of his ex-wife (Harriet Walter) and daughter (Michelle Dockery).

Directed by Ritesh Batra from a screenplay by Nick Payne the film maintains intrigue and emotional magnetism as its mystery unfolds. Unfortunately it goes wobbly in the last quarter as Tony��s refusal to face up to his past actions begins to look less willful and more stupid. The film then totters into a redemptive sentimentality that wouldn��t even play if it were made to seem more earned." ���The Sense of an Ending�� initially honors its source material by taking clever inventive cinematic liberties with it. The book a first-person account of its aged protagonist Tony Webster has a bifurcated structure: ���how I remembered these events�� and ���what really happened.�� Flashbacks arrive in blink-and-you-miss-them bursts that then expand to explain the significance of a look or a gesture; memory becomes a form of time travel putting Tony (Jim Broadbent) inside his own recollections taking the place of his young self."

or so it has been repeatedly claimed. In 1933 it was Fay Wray��s scantily clad beauty who took the rap for bringing Kong down off the top of the Empire State Building. (Fighter planes with machines guns helped.) By 1976 the beauty-beast relationship had grown rather more complicated and Jessica Lange was weepily begging Kong to hold onto her. In the 2005 redo it was Naomi Watts��s turn to shed tears for him. In ���Kong: Skull Island �� the big guy has a new look and a new gal pal Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) who��s somewhat feistier and certainly more sensibly dressed than her predecessors. She points and she shoots and not just her camera." Kong will be slugging it out with Godzilla soon enough. That doubtless excites studio executives and some fans but the promise of a return engagement drains much of the pathos from Kong. In many ways ���Skull Island�� looks and plays like its antecedents despite the cosmetic tweaks digital effects and attempts at inclusive casting. Like those earlier films it too asks the critical question in many such tales ��� ���Mirror mirror on the wall who��s the most monstrous of them all?�� ��� through an ape who because he��s a close relative turns our gaze back on ourselves. Kong is the beast we know the beast we deny the beast we fear the beast we kill." though Kong is no longer the beast we love the tragic captor-swain who if he didn��t always win the affections of his prisoners achieved immortality by seducing viewers. ���Skull Island�� is adept at goosing you; it deploys action-movie feints and horror-film frights capably amid its clich�s and deaths. Every so often it also pauses and allows Kong and Mason to move you. As each recognizes the other they bridge the divide but perhaps because their relationship is more empathetic than romantic these encounters don��t have the resonance they should. Alas beauty no longer has her beast the beast no longer has his beauty and this darkness has no heart even if it will have a sequel." the adventurers include a group of government-backed scientists run by Bill Randa (John Goodman) who has his glinting eyes on a mysterious seemingly unexplored island. Mysteries were made for solving and this island Randa reasons may contain all manner of wonders or perhaps something beyond human imagining. So with a military unit led by Lt. Col. Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) the scientists ship out accompanied by Mason a no-nonsense war photographer who��s soon trading barbs and looks with the world��s prettiest mercenary James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston)." critics have pushed and pulled at ���King Kong �� denouncing its representation of the islanders (played by black actors in the 1933 film) and reading it metaphorically through black masculinity and white femininity. Later Kong movies have tried to sidestep criticism by changing the representation of the islanders while leaving beauty and the beast intact. Yet even as ���Skull Island�� avoids some stereotypes it embraces others partly through a struggle that pits a pathological black character against a pair of white saviors. Kong meanwhile at times feels sidelined brought out every so often to wreak havoc and briefly exchange soulful looks with Mason." polish and behemoths that slither and thunder. The sets and creature designs are often beautifully filigreed but the larger picture remains murky. Backed by government and guns the scientists prove to be colonialists by another name an idea that the filmmakers bat around a bit including in allusions to Joseph Conrad��s novella ���Heart of Darkness.�� These references pad ���Skull Island �� giving audiences (and critics) something to chew on and help explain the repeated near-fetishistic nods to ���Apocalypse Now �� Francis Ford Coppola��s 1979 Vietnam-era retelling of the Conrad novel: the fireball sun the military helicopters in formation and even a napalm attack." including real locations and the fog of war: The story takes place in 1973 and the movie was primarily shot in Vietnam. (It was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts from a script by Dan Gilroy Max Borenstein and Derek Connolly.) If the sweat bantering grunts and teeming bars feel borrowed from innumerable other movies they are also mostly on hand to get the story up and the characters running which happens once the travelers pierce the thick clouds surrounding Skull Island. There they meet the enemy and the enemy is ��� surprise ��� us although there are plenty of digital terrors red in tooth and claw." especially in Hollywood. After years in storage the mighty ape with the big teeth and the thing for pale blondes has been dusted off and digitally turbocharged for ���Kong: Skull Island.�� Once again a lot of the noise and action involve guns monsters and crashing jungle chases but the most promising moments involve King Kong and the really little lady he unexpectedly meets. In the past their brief encounter made for some strange moments none weirder than in the original 1933 film when Kong pauses while undressing his human doll to smell his fingers." there��s also a Dennis Hopper-like character right out of ���Apocalypse Now �� a loopy grizzled survivor named Hank Marlow who is played by John C. Reilly in charming crazy mode (the narrator in ���Heart of Darkness is also a Marlow). Marlow pops up after Kong makes his star entrance swatting down helicopters and scattering survivors. Far larger than his forebears Kong looks as big as a mountain here. Supersizing is a default mode of the contemporary blockbuster but in this case a pumped-up Kong may have something to do with his role in an evolving studio franchise featuring monsters (a.k.a. MonsterVerse) that kicked off with the 2014 ���Godzilla.��"

Entranced Kostis takes to the island��s nude beaches to find the woman Anna (Elli Tringou) and once he does tries to ingratiate himself into her hedonistic band which adopts him as both a quasi-mascot and an emotional punching bag." the director Argyris Papadimitropoulos (who wrote the screenplay with Syllas Tzoumerkas) chronicles these misadventures with an effective detachment that��s not entirely neutral. ���Suntan�� has an undertone of resigned misanthropy but mostly this isn��t a movie about what the filmmaker thinks of the characters and their milieu. Replete with sometimes startling imagery (the removal of sand from an eye) ���Suntan�� captures a set of specific feelings: the exhilaration and embarrassment of falling followed by the desperate denial that one has landed in a very bad place." regardless of age size or shape Kostis has pretty much no chill.

both live action and animated rigorously places spectacle in the service of plot. The audience needs to be by turns reassured and surprised guided through startling and suspenseful events toward a never-in-doubt conclusion. The new ���Beauty and the Beast �� written by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos smoothly modernizes ��� and to some degree sanitizes ��� a story with a potentially thorny psychosexual subtext a tale of male animality and female captivity. He��s a beast and a prince. She��s his prisoner and his therapist.

The awkward business about imprisonment turning into true love is handled smoothly. If you want a hot and haunting ���Beauty and the Beast �� check out Jean Cocteau��s version or the fan-fiction-inspiring television show from the 1980s. This one is chaste and charming." whose Mrs. Potts is joined by other household objects with the voices (and briefly the faces) of movie stars. Stanley Tucci and Audra McDonald are the excitable harpsichord and the operatic wardrobe; Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen are the suave candelabra and the anxious clock.

Their singing and banter is so vivid and so natural that you almost take for granted that they appear to be mechanical objects clicking and whirling in physical space sharing the frame with human characters." �� ���there may be something there that wasn��t there before.�� The familiar elements are all in place of course. It��s ���Beauty and the Beast �� for goodness�� sake: a tale as old as time a song as old as rhyme and all that. And there are inspired flights of nostalgia as well visual evocations of the predigital glory of Busby Berkeley Ray Harryhausen and other masters of fantastical craft." as old archetypes are shocked to life and arrayed in garish synthetic modern effects. That might easily have happened here. Look (I mean: don��t look) at the horrors that have been visited in recent years on Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz.

What singing teapot would dare to challenge Angela Lansbury?" and you��re aware of the cold presence of lines of code behind the images. Most of the time though you are happily fooled.

He goes from annoying to evil when he stirs up the anti-intellectualism and xenophobia of a populist mob to serve his own egomaniacal ends. The residents of the castle fight back because their humanity is at stake. It��s just a fairy tale." directed by Bill Condon and starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in the title roles is more than a flesh-and-blood (and prosthetic fur-and-horns) revival of the 26-year-old cartoon and more than a dutiful trip back to the pop-culture fairy-tale well.

with Logan et al. forced on the run while pursued by the corporate concern. There are detours and kind strangers open skies and endless miles carnage and politics. En route Mr. Mangold occasionally resorts to clich� but many of his choices feel fresh paradoxically because he has the heart of a classicist. He has watched his share of Clint Eastwood and old Hollywood too. He��s also a sentimentalist as his nod to the 1953 western ���Shane�� suggests. (���A gun is a tool �� that film��s gunslinger says ���as good or as bad as the man using it.��) The romance of the righteous kill remains a cinematic article of faith." and features striking special-effects scenes in which the world shudders to a near standstill. Here though the pyrotechnics serve the story and are of a piece with a scaled-down realism that acknowledges ��� in its scars viscera and flood of parentless children ��� the cost of the endless fight. It loves that fight of course: That��s entertainment. But as it intimately tethers you to Logan and Laura at times uncomfortably (their claws were made for impaling) it reminds you that these mutants are never less than human." efficiently staged casually sadistic and near-ritualistic in how it conforms to the genre playbook. Logan is napping in his parked car not far from the United States-Mexico border when he is awakened by a gang trying to steal his tires. It��s an archetypal poke-the-bear scene the sort in which the hero announces his bona fides by eradicating villains too stupid to know what they are up against. Logan calls out to them as if giving them fair warning. It��s pointless. Like most generic bad guys these exist purely to wind the hero up ��� they��re the action-movie equivalent of foreplay ��� and soon Logan is slicing and dicing spearing bodies like kebabs." it plays looks and sounds like a movie ��� an old-school meets new-school pulp filled with intimations of mortality and raw ugly violence. Once again Hugh Jackman has saddled up to play the Wolverine a mutant who also goes by Logan and has always been the most satisfying character in the series. Mr. Jackman��s charm can lighten the glummest dirge but for comic-book agnostics the real appeal is Logan��s reluctance to get involved an ambivalence that can feel familiar to viewers exhausted by the same fight." and while the character��s claws are intact the movie is a major narrative and stylistic shift in its franchise universe. It was directed by James Mangold who shares script credit with Scott Frank and Michael Green and has the clarity and directness of a classic genre picture. It��s part western part neo-noir the kind of movie in which a stranger steps from the shadows and shakes off his isolation and existential burden long enough to right whatever wrong needs righting. You know him: He��s the man with the tight smile and split lip the one whose hard talk never fully obscures his wounded soul." but Logan is as much a hero as an outlier and can��t descend into nihilism. He needs a cause a banner to hoist. So the movie complicates its bloodletting including through a story line about corporate violence run amok in a near-lawless future. Enter the rogue geneticist (played with restrained flair by Richard E. Grant) with a venal aide-de-camp (a charismatic Boyd Holbrook) and an army of paramilitary cyborgs. These in turn connect to Laura (a terrific newcomer Dafne Keen) a watchful feral child who is fleeing across borders." Logan is playing the resistant head of a household that includes Laura as the ultimate in uncontrollable spawn and a sickly Professor X (Patrick Stewart) as their noble paterfamilias. Mr. Stewart using a rasp that suggests decay is working its way out from the inside does some beautiful work especially with Mr. Jackman. Pushing and pulling at each other they create a shared vulnerability that��s expressed both in physical degradations ��� the movie is filled with ravaged traumatized bodies ��� and in the contrapuntal play between Logan��s gruff tenderness and Professor X��s floundering. (He��s Gramps by way of King Lear.)"

The concerts ��� on two consecutive evenings at Barclays Center in Brooklyn ��� took place in June 2015. ���Contemporary Color �� directed by the brothers Bill and Turner Ross and co-produced by Mr. Byrne records not just the concerts but also the emotional backstage buzz of young performers working on a scale and in a context they have never encountered before. Many of these teenagers are also on the brink of separating from their colleagues after graduation.

Color guards meld elements of marching band and pep squad into a dance-oriented amalgam and perform during sporting events halftimes and in intramural competitions." but the ���Contemporary Color�� directors largely decline to follow them nervously cutting to backstage action when a hook eludes them. When a color guard truly connects with a magnetic musical performer (as is the case with St. Vincent��s collaboration with the color guard Field of View from West Chester Pa.) or the combination of music and choreography guides the filmmakers to an impressionistic approach (as with Devont� Hynes and the color guard the Black Watch from Mount Laurel N.J.) the application of cinema to live performance yields exceptional results. But over all this movie is less ���you are there�� than ���you had to be there.��" and that��s not even taking into account the performers of note enlisted for the event.

There��s relief when the offscreen world recedes just then. Yet part of what makes ���Get Out�� both exciting and genuinely unsettling is how real life keeps asserting itself scene after scene.

and wholly silent it was made in 1974 by the French director Philippe Garrel and is receiving its belated New York theatrical release at the Metrograph. Experimental by design though perhaps a bit by accident it mostly consists of images of the American actress Jean Seberg who after her debut as a celluloid saint in ���Saint Joan �� went off to peddle papers and make love to Jean-Paul Belmondo in Jean-Luc Godard��s ���Breathless.�� By the time Seberg made ���Les Hautes Solitudes �� her most famous roles were behind her; five years later she was dead from an apparent suicide." �� principally the American actress Tina Aumont a feral stunner with slashing cheekbones whose dark mane creates a sharply chromatic contrast with Seberg��s blondness. Here and there are also shots of the French actor Laurent Terzieff who appears Narcissus-like gazing at his reflection. Mostly the camera looks at Seberg who looks right back at it though sometimes away from it too glancing up or down or sideways. Occasionally the close-ups are tight enough that her face looms; at other times she is framed in a head-and-shoulders shot much like a classical Greek bust. Every so often she lies in bed or crouches in a corner." encouraging you to infer meaning and jump to conclusions as one image gives way to the next. You fill in the gaps between them a process similar to how viewers create meaning through montage shot by shot. The images in ���Les Hautes Solitudes �� though seem more casually strung together than assembled for specific meanings. That makes sense. In 2011 Mr. Garrel told the French magazine Les Inrocks that the idea ���was to make a film out of the outtakes of a film that never existed in the first place.�� One of the pleasures of ���Les Hautes Solitudes�� is that it encourages you to take up filmmaking as you write that nonexistent movie in your head." they disclose nothing beneath the surface. All that we know is what we see onscreen and that Seberg��s face is delicate and lightly creased. She��s rarely shown smiling although there are instances when she laughs emphatically moments that feel uncomfortable and artificial as if she were trying out an emotion she had forgotten. We know the texture of her skin; the patterns on the walls; the depth of field; the quality of the light; the contrast of the black-and-white film; the level of grain; the dowdiness of her clothes. She��s partial to granny dresses or maybe they��re nightgowns and when she stands in front of a window the sunlight glows softly creating a kind of ravishing halo effect: Saint Jean." Seberg makes love only to the camera though she often seems averse to or exasperated by its attentions. Or is she despairing or depressed? It��s impossible to know and neither she nor the film says. ���Les Hautes Solitudes�� isn��t only silent (no audible dialogue no music) it also has no explanatory text of any kind (subtitles included) or opening and closing credits. Instead there are faces most female beautiful and on the young side. The first belongs to the German singer Nico Mr. Garrel��s onetime companion who��s best known for chanteusing with the Velvet Underground.

Perhaps because ���My Life as a Zucchini �� directed by Claude Barras and based on a book by Gilles Paris comes from France (and Switzerland) the orphanage is a place of kindness rather than terror. The French republican imagination assumes that institutions are benevolent. Wickedness resides in individuals in this case the parents whose failures and outright crimes have damaged the innocence of Zucchini and his new friends." in any case is not horror but healing. It��s a bittersweet celebration of friendship and empathy as Zucchini makes peace with a bully named Simon and develops a crush on a newcomer named Camille. There is an enchanting ski trip a smattering of pranks and misunderstandings and a touch of suspense all rendered in expressive and imaginative visual detail. The animation technique is in some ways cruder than the digital dazzle that kids see all the time but also more soulful. The round wide-eyed faces of the orphans are not as perfectly detailed as those of their counterparts in some of this movie��s Oscar rivals but they are enigmatic and individual in ways that are hard to forget." a bit of caution may be in order for parents. While nothing shown onscreen is graphic or disturbing the movie is frank about the way the characters have been treated and also about their natural curiosity regarding the adult world.

Asylum is more likely to be granted if their histories involved genocide genital mutilation or a dictatorship." during which she learns which student has the best chance of receiving asylum. ���They could teach me about reality.��" whose frightened mother (Chinasa Ogbuagu) brought the family from Guinea to the United States to live with a man who subsequently abandoned them. Now the family is behind in the rent and facing eviction." cynical Sophie (Octavia Chavez-Richmond) is from the Dominican Republic and lives with an uncle who treats her as a household slave in an extended family where he resents her presence (another mouth to feed). Because his beer-drinking buddies make surreptitious passes at her when they come over to watch sports she trusts no one and her rage threatens to boil over. Her defensive hauteur leads her fellow students to think she is crazy." Mr. Newton declares that he didn��t set out to make a political film. But recent government actions lend a painful urgency to these interwoven stories. With the fear of deportation hanging over their heads these adolescents are forced to weigh major life decisions at an age when their American-born peers are fretting about the already stressful challenges of dating and getting into college." and the uncertain future of a student who chooses to leave the country gives the film an underlying sadness. Their ordeal feels cruel unnecessary and infuriatingly real." and at a post-prom party that threatens to erupt into a brawl.

Scenes of Sarah and Jessie gently roughhousing capture the blissful mother-daughter bond with a poignant intensity wrapping the viewer in the blanket of their intimacy." tugs of longing and desire after their lengthy separation are as palpable as ever. The two steal time to be alone together as the final preparations are being made for a wedding filled with raucous off-color humor." shy performance is as compelling as her chilling portrayal of a high-end escort in the Starz series ���The Girlfriend Experience �� but completely opposite in tone.

The big fight takes place against a background of layoffs and budget cuts. The teachers are harassed by the students and undermined by the administration yet they persist in the work of education.

We know that Campbell has a young daughter (Alexa Nisenson) and a pregnant wife (JoAnna Garcia Swisher). We learn nothing at all about Strickland except that he is the subject of wild legends among the student body. His job in the movie is to teach Campbell some hard lessons about being a man." directed by Richie Keen from a script by Van Robichaux and Evan Susser breaks no new ground.

There��s a grouchy principal (Dean Norris) a horny guidance counselor (Jillian Bell) a dweeby security guard (Kumail Nanjiani) a nutty football coach (Tracy Morgan) and a femme fatale French instructor (Christina Hendricks). They provide a Greek chorus of goofiness behind the main conflict which is between Mr. Campbell (Charlie Day) an anxious English teacher and his profoundly irritable colleague Mr. Strickland (Ice Cube) whose subject is history." and the seniors are pulling pranks ��� involving a horse paintball guns and a lot of penis graffiti ��� at the Atlanta high school where the two adversaries work. This provides an extra dollop of slapstick chaos but the kids are peripheral to the movie��s main interest which is in the mismatch and implicit bromance between Ice Cube and Mr. Day.

Set once upon a time the movie spins a legend that never was: Every 60 years slavering creatures emerge from beyond to sharpen their teeth on human bones and stuff their bellies on meat. The whole thing plays out as if it had been thought up by someone who while watching ���Game of Thrones�� and smoking a bowl started riffing on walls China and production money." bodies are abstracted into larger geometric shapes and people transform into a collective mass ornament. This transformation obviously takes on sinister meaning when such formations are adapted for say Nazi propaganda as demonstrated in the film ��� Triumph of the Will.��" William (Mr. Damon) who��s trying to find what he calls ���black powder �� a.k.a. gunpowder.

Willem Dafoe the whites of his eyes shining is there too slinking around as Ballard a Western prisoner who long ago also sought the black powder." wearing hair extensions and employing an on-and-off Irish accent looks uncharacteristically ill at ease during much of this. He may be the headliner but he��s also just one of this movie��s many many whirring parts. ���The Great Wall�� flirts with romance and bleats out a little propagandistic blather about the benefits of bilateral action but the focus throughout remains on multitudes of shifting surging bodies ��� human and beast digital and not ��� that as they ebb and flow resemble a Chinese military pageant and a lavish Busby Berkeley number. At times the effect brings to mind the German theorist  Siegfried Kracauer��s ideas about Berkeley-like revues or as he wrote in 1927 ���indissoluble girl clusters whose movements are demonstrations of mathematics.��" plus striking locations (the Rainbow Mountains) digital wizardry and battles between hordes of critters (called Tao Tei) and legions of soldiers. These are distinguished by skill and hue like the blue-clad Crane Corp who bungee-jump off the wall with spears. Outside of the bromantic quipping between William and Tovar the dialogue is aggressively simple (no frills no poetry) and skews along the lines of ���Release the Kraken�� or in this case bring out the flaming balls of death and so forth. This seems to suit the director Zhang Yimou (���Hero��) who lavishes much of his attention on the wall which amusingly suggests a giant Swiss Army knife scissors included." �� though the bodies are divided into two distinct oppositional configurations: the raw and the cooked.

Anyone who has even a slight acquaintance with Freudian theory or Japanese erotica will grasp the psychosexual significance of those eels who live in the aquifer underneath an Alpine spa and occasionally make their way into the plumbing and beyond. My questions are of a more basic nature: How did they get down there in the first place? Are they an invasive species or part of the native ecosystem? What evolutionary process might account for their curiously symbiotic relationship with the spa��s human residents?" as a dogged young man (Dane DeHaan) makes his way through an asylum-like complex of buildings in search of answers only to become ever more deeply ensnared in the place��s sinister mysteries.

Mr. Verbinski doesn��t so much observe shiny surfaces and opulent furnishings as caress them sending a frisson of visual delight through his camera as it glides down corridors and soars over wooded glades." I don��t usually spend much time thinking about eels but ���A Cure for Wellness�� gave me no choice. Ever since the screening I��ve been wondering about those slithery creatures which you may have noticed in the trailers and the posters where a bunch of them share a bathtub with Mia Goth one of the movie��s stars." really though two and a half hours may be more of this kind of fun than a body can stand. You might feel like you��re in the company of a manic cinephile friend breathlessly recounting his favorite movie scenes in no particular order. You admire his devotion his taste and his scholarship but in the end the experience is probably more satisfying for him than it is for you." Gore Verbinski or the screenwriter Justin Haythe for declining to provide a thorough explanation. ���A Cure for Wellness�� defiantly and splendidly flouts the tenets of plausibility and coherence which have never interested Mr. Verbinski very much. His r�sum� after all includes ���The Lone Ranger�� (also written by Mr. Haythe) ���Rango�� and most notably the first three ���Pirates of the Caribbean�� movies.

There are clues and false leads shocking discoveries and bouts of talking-bad-guy exposition narrow escapes and fights to the death. And those eels of course.

it is easy to guess who the dominant player was in ���Fifty Shades Darker �� and it probably wasn��t the new director James Foley. He��s a professional with real credits so I assume that he��s not finally responsible for the ineptitude of ���Fifty Shades Darker �� which ranges from continuity issues to unsurprisingly risible writing. There are also abrupt swings in tone dead-end detours and flatline performances including from Ms. Johnson. The sex is strained and certainly seems to burn serious calories (Christian flips Anastasia like a pancake) but finally pales next to the commodity fetishism. The use of Ben and Jerry��s vanilla ice cream however made for great product placement." turning dominance submission and toys into an acceptable spectacle. But it apparently took a writer as terrible as E L James the author of the ���Fifty Shades�� series to really hit the commercial sweet spot. The result is a clutch of best sellers a hit movie (based on the first book ���Fifty Shades of Grey��) and now a sequel ���Fifty Shades Darker �� that��s almost bad enough to recommend." not quite though it��s always instructive to watch how many different ways one movie can go wrong and to guess what happened between a first feature and a second. For all its flaws ���Fifty Shades of Grey�� had a competent director Sam Taylor-Johnson who mostly wrung a watchable movie out of the material partly by letting lightness and laughter in. It also had a natural star in Dakota Johnson one of those unforced charmers who can deliver bad lines so gracefully that after a while you don��t much care about their quality. With low-key charisma she drew you toward her so that your attention and hopes fell on her instead of the nonsense surrounding her. She was a stealth weapon." �� so presumably knew better.

Once again the story involves the on-and-off tie-her-up tie-her-down romance between Anastasia Steele (Ms. Johnson) and her billionaire boyfriend Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) a guy with sculptured muscles expensive playthings and dreary issues. Stuff and kink happens: A gun is fired a would-be rapist is punished and Anastasia is bound hand and foot.

But because its primary function outside of making bank is to extend two brands ��� Lego and Batman ��� it can��t help but disappoint. One reason that the first ���Lego�� movie worked as well as it did is that its novelty and trippier moments conveyed a sense of play and unboundedness which is part of the appeal of Legos themselves. (It��s the better movie and ad.) The Batman story by contrast proves to be a prison one its creators never escape. They toss around the superstuff and giggle at the legend but they��re finally confined by the superhero story and its corporate sanctity. It��s a bottom-line bummer." ���The Lego Batman Movie�� is pretty irresistible. It��s silly without being truly strange or crossing over into absurdity. Along the way it pulls off a nifty balancing act: It gives the PG audience its own Batman movie (it��s a superhero starter kit) and takes swipes at the subgenre mostly by gently mocking the seriousness that has become a deadening Warner Bros. default. ���The Lego Batman Movie�� can��t atone for a movie as grindingly bad as the studio��s ���Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice �� which stars Ben Affleck as the Gotham City brooder but at least someone on that lot gets the joke." mind you just enough to keep the jokes pinging and zinging at least until the story amps up. Most of that involves the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) who��s not the transgressive opposition but a whining smiler desperately yearning for Batman��s attention. This isn��t as funny or engaging as the filmmakers seem to think partly because a child-friendly Joker can��t have the scariness or anarchic threat that distinguishes this character��s better iterations. (He can��t compete partly because he��s nowhere near as loopy as this Batman.) Mostly the Joker is the master of ceremonies for the rest of the villainous horde a motley crew of creatures that includes Harley Quinn (Jenny Slate) who��s mostly a trauma trigger for ���Suicide Squad �� another supersplat." a portal into childhood. That makes resistance fairly futile or at least tough especially when the crew ushering you into the past is up to the task as is the case here. Chris McKay directed this one working from a jammed script by Seth Grahame-Smith Chris McKenna Erik Sommers Jared Stern and John Whittington. (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who directed ���The Lego Movie �� helped produce ���The Lego Batman Movie.��) The whole vibe is as the first ���Lego�� movie insisted with its deliriously catchy anthem awesome so relax enjoy the show go with the flow. I mean who hates Legos? Isn��t that like hating childhood?" filling in its 104-minute running time with loads of busy action deadpan humor visual comedy reflexive bits and an overfamiliar story line. It features the usual cavalcade of marquee-ready talent (Rosario Dawson Conan O��Brien Mariah Carey) the comic and less so but owes much of its pleasure and juice to Will Arnett who voices Batman. The movie puts a goofy spin on the Batman saga but it squeezes its brightest most sustained comedy from Mr. Arnett��s hypnotically sepulchral voice which conveys the entire bat ethos ��� the Sturm und Drang the darkness and aloneness the resoluteness and echoiness ��� in vocal terms. It��s blissfully self-serious near-Wagnerian and demented." ���The Lego Batman Movie�� looks as good as its predecessor ���The Lego Movie.�� This one is similarly shiny and bright though sometimes as teasingly dark as Batman. Even when the story drags which it does as the action grows frenetic the shiny and bright bits catch the eye. As in the first movie the character design does much of the most meaningful work because it conveys part of what��s enjoyable about Legos including their smooth-to-the-touch plastic surfaces and knobby bits (studs in Lego lingo) which you can almost feel in your hands as you watch. One of the satisfactions of Legos is their touch sensation a sense memory that��s imprinted on brains too." of course not though that gets to what��s frustrating about these movies which are so insistently good-natured and relentlessly hyped that it feels almost churlishly old-school raising even modest objections to the fact that ��� in addition to being you know fun ��� they��re also commercials. It��s not new or news that movies have long sold stuff including studio tie-ins and toys as Walt Disney explained by example decades ago though like Pixar he was also in the business of storytelling and not merely corporate-brand storytelling and building. Certainly there are worse things in life and definitely worse movies including the ���Transformers�� blockbusters which sell both toys and war."

The initial spectacle of mediocrity condescending to genius is painful but the subsequent triumph of self-taught brilliance over credentialed ignorance is thrilling to witness." an uncanny and thrilling communion between the filmmaker ��� whose previous work includes both a documentary and a narrative feature about the Congolese anti-colonialist leader Patrice Lumumba ��� and his subject. The voice-over narration (read by Samuel L. Jackson) is entirely drawn from Baldwin��s work. Much of it comes from notes and letters written in the mid-1970s when Baldwin was somewhat reluctantly sketching out a book never to be completed about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr." �� he wrote early in his career in the introductory note to his first collection of essays ���Notes of a Native Son.�� The disarming intimate candor of that statement characterized much of what would follow as would a reckoning with the difficulties of living up to such apparently straightforward aspirations. Without sliding into confessional bathos his voice was always personal and frank creating in the reader a feeling of complicity of shared knowledge and knowing humor." a remedial course in American history and an advanced seminar in racial politics ��� a concise roughly 90-minute movie with the scope and impact of a 10-hour mini-series or a literary doorstop. It is not an easy or a consoling movie but it is the opposite of bitter or despairing. ���I can��t be a pessimist because I��m alive �� Baldwin said. ���I��m forced to be an optimist.��" notably ���The Devil Finds Work �� Baldwin��s 1976 meditation on race Hollywood and the mythology of white innocence. His published and unpublished words ��� some of the most powerful and penetrating ever assembled on the tortured subject of American identity ��� accompany images from old talk shows and news reports from classic movies and from our own decidedly non-post-racial present." about the presidency of Barack Obama and the recrudescence of white nationalism in its wake but in a sense he explained it all in advance. He understood the deep contradictory patterns of our history and articulated with a passion and clarity that few others have matched the psychological dimensions of racial conflict: the suppression of black humanity under slavery and Jim Crow and the insistence on it in African-American politics and art; the dialectic of guilt and rage forgiveness and denial that distorts relations between black and white citizens in the North as well as the South; the lengths that white people will go to wash themselves clean of their complicity in oppression." as in a speech for an audience of British university students you are aware of Baldwin��s profound weariness. He must explain himself ��� and also his country ��� again and again with what must have been sorely tested patience. When the students erupt in a standing ovation at the end of his remarks Baldwin looks surprised even flustered. You glimpse an aspect of his personality that was often evident in his writing: the vulnerable bright ambitious man thrust into a public role that was not always comfortable." ���I Am Not Your Negro.�� Let me do so now for that reader (if he��s still interested) and for everybody else too. Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called ���race relations�� ��� white supremacy and the resistance to it in plainer English ��� this movie will make you think again and may even change your mind. Though its principal figure the novelist playwright and essayist James Baldwin is a man who has been dead for nearly 30 years you would be hard-pressed to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history." or hold him up as a figure to be admired from a distance. You feel entirely in his presence hanging on his every word following the implications of his ideas as they travel from his experience to yours. At the end of the movie you are convinced that you know him. And more important that he knows you. To read Baldwin is to be read by him to feel the glow of his affection the sting of his scorn the weight of his disappointment the gift of his trust." in reaction to something we had written about blackness and whiteness in recent movies my colleague Manohla Dargis and I received a note from a reader. ���Since when is everything about race?�� he wanted to know. Perhaps it was a rhetorical question." where he reported on the civil rights movement and the murderous white response to it Baldwin modestly described himself as a witness a watchful presence on the sidelines of tragedy and heroism an outsider by virtue of his Northern origins his sexuality and his alienation from the Christianity of his childhood. But he was also a prophet able to see the truths revealed by the contingent complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict. This is not to say that he transcended the struggle or detached himself from it. On the contrary he demonstrated that writing well and thinking clearly are manifestations of commitment and that irony skepticism and a ruthless critical spirit are necessary tools for effective moral and political action."

The meeting is a wash (it plays like a metaphor for Hollywood) but is soon forgotten down at the soup kitchen where Jackie is doing community service." but mostly the filmmakers rack up the miles and Jackie wears through shoe leather moving from here to there. At the soup kitchen he finds a sympathetic (and hostage) audience in the homeless clientele and a counterweight to the cable executive in Harmony (Leslie Mann) who��s also doing community service. Ms. Mann giggles and laughs too much which fits Harmony��s role as a prop. She exists to humanize Jackie hoot at his groaners and in one scene gaze adoringly at him while at his feet. She beds him because she has daddy issues; their age difference suggests that the filmmakers share those issues. Mr. De Niro��s old pal Harvey Keitel plays papa." Taylor Hackford never makes any of this pop which isn��t a surprise given the material. He also doesn��t give you much to look at other than street scenery and Mr. De Niro��s mug which the actor bunches up while cycling through soft sour moods (aggravated exasperated) occasionally dropping a smile that might as well be a frown.

It��s not exactly a Choose Your Own Adventure but you can opt either for the pleasure of surprise at the end or for the satisfaction of working out the puzzle as you go along." for his part revels in the chance to use his sensitivity for evil and to showboat his way through a series of appropriately overwrought characterizations.

Dr. Fletcher��s primary function is to explain the movie to the audience foreshadowing the climax with her heterodox pseudo-scholarly theories about her many-sided patient but Ms. Buckley also provides a dimension of warmth and wit that ���Split�� would be much duller and uglier without." and sometimes more than a little icky in its prurient maudlin interest in the abuse of children. It��s also absorbing and sometimes slyly funny. Some years back ��� it��s startling to contemplate just how long ago it was ��� Mr. Shyamalan was puffed up into a cinematic visionary hailed on the cover of Newsweek as ���The Next Spielberg.�� That hype (and his own self-aggrandizing tendencies) placed a disproportionate burden of significance on a filmmaker who has always been at heart a superior genre hack." inevitably deflationary revelations for as long as possible minimizing the obligatory third-act flurry of chasing fighting and bloodletting. And he sneaks in a few self-referential winks including an allusion to his last really good movie that feels at once like a promise of better mischief to come and an implicit apology for all the disappointment in between." spooky misfit named Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) ��� is singled out for special attention from the camera (though not at least initially from Dennis and his colleagues). Her fellow abductees Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) alternate between panic and defiance but Casey counsels patience and watchfulness. Flashbacks to a hunting trip she took as a 5-year-old (Izzie Leigh Coffey) in the company of her father (Sebastian Arcelus) and uncle (Brad William Henke) seem to explain the source of her survival skills though it turns out that those memories have another darker meaning as well." Mr. Shyamalan stands as a pioneer of spoiler-centric cinema. Like those movies and like his later lesser entertainments (���The Village��; ���The Happening��) ���Split�� is all plot an ingenious (and also ridiculous) conceit spun into an elegant ribbon of suspense. The less said about that plot therefore the better." and he sounds weirdly like John Turturro for a guy supposedly from Philly. In fact Dennis is played by the soft-eyed shape-shifting British actor James McAvoy as are the other 23 personalities residing in the body of a guy who shares the surname of a famous (and famously odd) Philadelphia-born artist." a brand associated with unpretentious clever neo-traditionalist scare-pictures like ���Insidious �� ���Paranormal Activity�� and ���The Purge.�� That seems like the right company for Mr. Shyamalan and the January pre-Oscar doldrums may be the perfect moment to appreciate his skills. He is a master of mood pace and limited perspective moving the camera so that the thing you most desperately want to see ��� and are most afraid of seeing ��� remains teasingly out of sight." some female at least one is a child (named Hedwig) and another (named Barry) is a gay stereotype.

plump raindrops and churning ocean depths with gaudy trade-show flash. ���The Red Turtle �� a feature by the Dutch animator Michael Dudok de Wit hews to a quieter proudly analog (or at least analog-evoking) approach. The waves that toss the nameless protagonist a presumably shipwrecked fellow with black-dot eyes and an inky beard are proudly two-dimensional and look as if they had been rendered with a pen and a brush rather than a mouse and a software application." an enigmatic and beautifully drawn creature that seems to have some kind of grudge against our hero shows up just when you start to wonder if it will. Every time the man tries to leave the island the turtle smashes his raft and knocks him back over the sandbar onto the beach. This leads to a confrontation that nudges the story all the way into the realm of fable. I won��t say exactly what happens except to note that it��s both enchanting and a little queasy-making. But new characters do appear fleshing out the drama and the imagery. Events take place that allow Mr. Dudok de Wit to make the most of his subdued palette and his spare lyrical draftsmanship." gentle magic. It wants you to smile and say ���Ahh �� rather than gasp and say ���Wow.�� But somehow the understatement can feel a bit overdone as if the film were hovering over you awaiting an expression of admiration. And it is hard not to admire the earnest artistry on display even though it may also be hard to be as moved or enraptured as you suspect you should." a French-Belgian-Japanese co-production made under the auspices of Studio Ghibli  (home of the great Hayao Miyazaki) in Tokyo is also notable at least in contrast to most American commercial animation for the absence of celebrity voices or indeed of any human speech at all. The score by Laurent Perez del Mar does include some wordless choral vocalizing but the story like the visual style is simple and elemental like a picture book that needs no words." mutedly whimsical charm with a light washing of eco-mysticism.

lysergic acid diethylamide was where it really everything was at. Both were in their 20s when they first experimented with psychedelics an experience they say in the movie indelibly changed each for good and some might say bad. A California native Mr. Scully had been studying at Berkeley before coming under the influence of Owsley Stanley an intimate of the Grateful Dead and fervent advocate for acid. The more voluble Mr. Sand a Brooklynite entered the scene through Millbrook ��� the estate in upstate New York where Timothy Leary and friends partied for years ��� eventually going west. (In the early 1960s Leary helped oversee the Harvard Psilocybin Project researching LSD.)" these crates promised a ray of sun in each juicy bite. In 1970 Florida anointed itself the Sunshine State but this documentary suggests that way out West where much of this acid was produced was where the sun shone the brightest." Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully seemed to be operating on a similar wavelength and the movie gets a lot of mileage from their sometimes excellent at times hair-raising occasionally puckishly funny and altogether wild adventures. At least according to ���The Sunshine Makers �� theirs is the story of two young men who found and (arguably) lost their way in the ��60s a tale that has resonance for the bigger sociopolitical picture. Both Mr. Scully and Mr. Sand saw themselves as missionaries of a type spreading transcendence one hit at a time. Mr. Sand says that during one early enlightened moment a voice told him ���Your job on this planet is to make psychedelics and turn on the world.�� He obeyed that voice unconditionally." Cosmo Feilding Mellen fluidly knits together a lot of information people and places sights and sounds including some faded pretty far-out archival footage of Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully making acid in labs back in the day. (The editor Nick Packer deserves credit as well.) As Mr. Mellen plaits together these individual histories he incessantly toggles between past and present. Some of the flashbacks to the ��60s are as familiar as hippie chicks and the corner of Haight and Ashbury but Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully are true individuals with delightful quirks and weird tales that keep the material from genericism. (There are several scenes of Mr. Sand practicing yoga in the nude a lifelong habit that he��s continued into his 70s.)" but Mr. Mellen��s sympathies are transparently with his subjects even if he does check in (humorously and a touch condescendingly) with some of the cops who once chased down Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully. At times it all seems a bit too well sunny especially given what happened after Mr. Sand and Mr. Scully��s production increased and their stacks of cash grew. (Another documentary ���Orange Sunshine �� focuses on the Brotherhood of Eternal Love which distributed their acid.) Still even if you never shake the feeling that there��s more to this story more darkness and scares there��s no question that hanging out with Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn on acid has its appeal."

as business-school students and more than a few fast-food consumers might know is the entrepreneur who put the big numbers on the McDonald��s sign. In the 1950s that number was a lowly one million but has since been replaced by the unfathomable somewhat terrifying ���billions and billions.�� Kroc liked to call himself the founder of McDonald��s. His memoir ���Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald��s �� promises that it is ���The personal story behind founder Ray Kroc��s amazing success!�� Some of that sentence is true; the success part is at any rate. Certainly it was a McGreat success though one larded with McFibs." he also grows more self-interested adapting a purely instrumental approach to other people that seeps into his home life. One truism about great-man movies is that you can��t have one without a nagging or a loving wife. Ray has both. Laura Dern plays Ethel the nag the starter wife who enters frown first. Ms. Dern does what she can with bad lighting drab surroundings and an underconceived character. As Joan Ray��s third wife Linda Cardellini fares better. For one thing she gets to smile (she lights up the room and Ray) wears pretty clothes and enjoys the fruits of his achievements. (The second Mrs. Kroc Jane Dobbins Green remains M.I.A.)" John Lee Hancock keeps things overly neat and tidy (it all shines or gleams) but he also keeps the story humming even when business talk threatens to slow it down. Like Ray he seems lifted by the McDonalds and there��s real heart and pleasure in a flashback  in which they figure out their system��s choreography moving young confused workers around like chess pieces. The McDonalds�� introduction of Fordism to their business turned employees into factory workers and changed the restaurant industry though the movie elides the global stakes. Mostly it sticks to milestones and showdowns up until the handshake deal that changed everything." overshooting and overcutting when he should let the camera run. (I lost count of all the angles he uses to show Ray reading a map.) That��s too bad because some of the movie��s best moments involve Ray alone including a scene in which ��� in boxer shorts a bottle nearby ��� he drops the needle on a motivational record. As an actor Mr. Keaton often comes across as jittery as a thoroughbred at the gate so when he goes still it feels as if something important is happening. Ray remains an unanswered not especially compelling question but Mr. Keaton comes close to making you believe there��s soul to go with the fries and freneticism." but the customers aren��t buying. His fortunes change when he comes across a bustling burger joint in San Bernardino Calif. called McDonald��s where crowds of smiling customers sail through fast-moving lines. He��s impressed by the turnout but he��s more taken with the seamless efficiency of the McDonalds�� Speedee Service System. The brothers bring Ray into their business showing him how it��s done not realizing that they��ve invited a snake into their garden. Mr. Keaton nearly levitates off the floor in moments like this creating a contact high." ���The Founder�� tells an old-fashioned sweet-and-sour fable of good American capitalism versus bad and how Ray Kroc built his fortune by steamrolling Mac and Dick McDonald ��� the brothers who built the first McDonald��s ��� before going in for the corporate kill. History has at times portrayed these brothers as na�ve almost as patsies. ���The Founder �� by contrast suggests that the McDonalds weren��t remotely rapacious enough to fend him off. They��re proud and satisfied by what they��ve built and the warm mournful performances of Nick Offerman as Dick and the invaluable John Carroll Lynch as Mac are arguments for decency. (That��s nice but this is still all about Ray.)" the whirling center of ���The Founder �� doesn��t come across as a meat-and-potatoes man ��� much less a mogul destined to peddle burgers and fries. As played by Michael Keaton an actor who generates terrific centrifugal force Ray seems more like a guy who fuels up on 10 cups of coffee before calling it a night with a bottle of Scotch. ���The Founder�� never figures out what makes him spin and run and keep on running but it does give you Mr. Keaton zinging around like the Road Runner. His kinetic performance doesn��t enhance the movie; it is the movie." underscoring his weaknesses and vices boozing and philandering. Even with a few pins stuck in him the great man remains great and very much the charismatic triumphant individual. That��s true of Ray too who for all his bad deeds never comes across as a true heavy. Mr. Keaton is good company for one and villainy just doesn��t work in entertainments like this which can��t risk turning us off. Happily there are always lawyers in this case Harry J. Sonneborn (B. J. Novak) who slithers up to Ray to explain where the money is. All Ray does is follow it."

He brought his earnest voice and moody guitar into the 1960s counterculture when he was in his early 30s and he made a substantial impact musically well into the 1970s. In that time he was a cult artist on a very large scale so to speak.

Ms. Robinson and Ms. Howell have kitted out their movie handsomely but there��s not enough story here or enough anything else namely a persuasive psychological portrait of Claire to make up for that lack. The filmmakers make good use of their locations and the creeping camera movements and on occasion they brighten the gloom with daubs of color ��� with Connor��s knitting a gaudily painted car the forest green ��� that add vibrancy to a tale that��s mutely almost reluctantly told." deliberate slow boil ���Claire in Motion�� is thicker with atmosphere than plot. It was written and directed by Lisa Robinson and Annie J. Howell (they also wrote and directed ���Small Beautifully Moving Parts��) who have a nice way of unsettling a mood destabilizing a scene and creating a sense of vague threat. When the movie opens everything seems ordinary banal: There��s a woman in bed and a man fussing elsewhere in the room.

Paul (Chris Beetem) is a professor of ornithology. Together with their son Connor (Zev Haworth) they live in a nice house in the town of Athens which appears almost as depopulated as a nuclear test site. The pervasive quiet reinforces Claire��s isolation (her next-door neighbors seem to be her only friends) which seems a bit odd especially after Paul goes missing. Where are the concerned friends the worried relatives? (The absence of people here like some of the rough technical edges has an unfortunate way of taking you out of the movie.)" the search is dropped. It makes sense (small police department limited resources no clues) but leaves Claire without answers. It also ends up stranding the filmmakers who cook up a narrative diversion in the figure of an arty grad student Allison (Anna Margaret Hollyman). Paul liked to go off for some kind of extreme solo outdoors adventuring heading into the deep forest for instance with little more than a backpack. As Allison explains to Claire over a succession of dead-end encounters Paul was also cultivating an entirely separate life from his wife one involving dubious art confessional hugs and ukuleles." the title character in ���Claire in Motion�� takes sensible action. She reports his absence to the police puts up missing-person leaflets and comforts their child. She also begins exploring the murkier corners of her husband��s life the places that he��s never invited her into and that turn up a couple of mild surprises. Repeatedly she returns to the dark ominous forest where he apparently disappeared like some fairy-tale casualty; at times she dreams of him and his caresses.

Gamblers become starving indentured servants and the Straw Hats liberate them in escalating battles rendered with a crude line and an often well golden palette. If you��re a boy between say 8 and 12 and wired to the hilt on Coca-Cola the shrill exhausting ���Gold�� might be for you. But only if." �� we are fleetingly introduced to these youthful buccaneers seemingly plucked from disparate movie genres: Zoro is a swordsman; Chopper a cute cartoony reindeer evoking a Pok�mon; Sanji a ladies�� man; Franky a cyborg; Usopp a sniper; Brook a skeleton. Their volatile leader Luffy can stretch and enlarge his body like Plastic Man; his sentences almost always end in multiple exclamation points. The female members ��� Nami a cat burglar and Robin an archaeologist ��� are eye-roll-inducingly buxom." �� based on Eiichiro Oda��s manga you��ll be completely lost at its 13th cinematic entry ���One Piece Film: Gold.�� The movie directed by Hiroaki Miyamoto doesn��t provide a back story for its abundant characters. All you need to know is that the heroes the Straw Hat pirates are seagoing adventurers on a planet dominated by a world government. The pirates don��t loot vessels; they simply seek lost treasure. (The series title comes from the name of a trove in the first installment.)"

���Underworld: Blood Wars�� introduces new dangers (self-propelled bullets and nightshade ��� fatal for some vampires but only painful and paralyzing for Selene) and backdrops including a vampire outpost in the frozen north and what must be history��s dullest vampire soiree. (After so many years undead who could party?)" called Lycans use guns and swords to settle a centuries-old feud ��� showed signs of growing more playful with its fourth installment ���Underworld: Awakening�� (2012) which moved away from the series��s labored mythology and threw in Stephen Rea as a mad scientist." but here it seems like a taunt ��� a guarantee of visual monotony to complement the anemic entertainment value." in her full leather get-up is Selene (Kate Beckinsale somehow still invested) a vampire ���death dealer�� wanted by both sides. Apparently her blood and the blood of her daughter (who has gone into hiding since the last movie) can confer special powers on those infused with it ��� a property that has made the strains sought after by the vampire council member Semira (Lara Pulver) and a Lycan leader Marius (Tobias Menzies)." Anna Foerster and the screenwriter Cory Goodman had set out to complete a dissertation instead of a sequel."

speaking to Faith Morris of the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis poses a knotty question about how far his cause of eliminating race hate has yet to go. Her reply: ���How long is this documentary going to be?��" a journeyman who has played backup for Chuck Berry has an unusual hobby. He cultivates cordial relationships with prominent racists ��� Ku Klux Klan leaders front men for neo-Nazi groups and so on ��� and through a form of friendly persuasion tries to steer them from their bigotry." Race & America �� directed by Matt Ornstein begins by showing Mr. Davis tooling around the D.C. area where he lives. He speaks with friends and neighbors some African-American some not. One of his stops is Ben��s Chili Bowl where he interviews the owner Virginia Ali a friend about progress and setbacks in race relations." where he delivers a lecture. He tells his audience ���Always keep the lines of communication with your antagonist open �� because ���if you��re talking you��re not fighting.�� Then we see him patiently talking with white men and women who hold the most repellent views imaginable. When Mr. Davis tries to share his philosophy with Black Lives Matter activists however the discussion gets very heated ��� on both sides." a white political operative and ally of President-elect Donald J. Trump equated the first lady Michelle Obama to a gorilla then said in a follow-up interview that his remarks were ���not racist.��"

the actors have a beautifully balanced rapport that prevents one from dominating the other. Mr. Feldman��s pleading eyes and indecisive body language lend Henry an endearing immaturity and Ms. Thirlby��s gentle confidence makes Dianne��s hurt all the more heartbreaking. As the couple try out romantic alternatives ��� he with an orgy-loving musician (Analeigh Tipton) and she with a married performance artist (Adam Goldberg) ��� the director holds the focus on the movie��s essential question: What do you do when the life you want is incompatible with the love you have?" ���Between Us�� makes a familiar situation feel remarkably fresh." a young Los Angeles couple celebrating six years together the search for a new apartment opens an unexpected rift in their relationship. She wants to purchase a modern spacious home in an upscale neighborhood; he wants to continue a bohemian downtown lifestyle ��� a vision he thought they shared. A stalled filmmaker in his 30s Henry must confront not only his financial inadequacies but also something much more nebulous: his self-image." but here the writer and director Rafael Palacio Illingworth injects small subtleties that enrich and complicate the emotional landscape. The couple��s devotion is never in question but Henry who fetishizes the infatuation phase of a relationship is constantly mourning something he may never have again. And Dianne chooses to ignore how her comfortable background might contribute to Henry��s insecurities."

but he does have a strong sense of place and a brisk gritty directing style. Even though in retrospect ���The Ardennes�� feels a little obvious and secondhand it unfolds with enough speed and wit to hold your attention. Keep your eye out for ostriches." with a slick of dark hair down the middle of his head and a Kirk Douglas dimple in the center of his chin is the wilder sibling eager to fight and possessing a certain thuggish charm. Dave (Jeroen Perceval) bald and slight is comparatively quiet and sensitive. Sylvie (Veerle Baetens) who works in a nightclub and goes to recovery meetings seems tougher and more levelheaded than either brother though you have to wonder a bit about her taste in men. And you might also wonder where the boys�� mother (Viviane de Muynck) went wrong." ���The Ardennes �� directed by Robin Pront takes an effective (if not terribly original) pulp premise and executes it with a decent measure of soul and skill. The film��s title refers to the densely forested part of Belgium where the  Battle of the Bulge was fought in World War II and the plot swerves from the unspecified Flemish city where Dave Kenny and Sylvie live toward that savage sylvan landscape. The brothers (and the audience) find a few surprises there a handful of colorful secondary characters and some arresting nonnative fauna." in her meetings and in conversations with Dave talks about taking control and making choices but Kenny��s return threatens to make a cruel joke of their optimism. The rules of this genre dictate that people can��t change that those who try to pull themselves out are dragged back in and that blood loyalty and bloodshed are never very far apart." �� Dave Kenny and Sylvie participate in a botched crime for which Kenny ��� Dave��s brother and Sylvie��s boyfriend ��� takes the fall. By the time he��s out of prison four years (which is to say a few seconds) later Sylvie and Dave have sobered up and conceived a child. This makes for an awkward Christmastime homecoming."

but then the film was abandoned an apparent casualty of changing political priorities and a shift from renunciation to reconstruction. Simply put the Allies needed Germans to rebuild their country. (According to one scholarly account Mr. Bernstein was informed that ���policy at the moment in Germany is entirely in the direction of encouraging stimulating and interesting the Germans out of their apathy.��) An incomplete version of the film titled ���Memory of the Camps �� was released in 1984; some of the material was used in another documentary ���A Painful Reminder�� (1985)." though because this is not like most films. In contrast to many movies about atrocities including some documentaries there is nothing reassuring about ���German Concentration Camps Factual Survey.�� There are no hollow claims about the ���triumph�� of the human spirit no third-act heroics or narrative balms. The few smiles here are desperate. Mostly there are starving survivors milling about the camps and staring into the camera with hollow eyes. Some lie on the floor too frail to move; others drift about on stick legs. In most camps the survivors appear outnumbered by the dead with corpses scattered like refuse or in piles and in pits." the British producer Sidney Bernstein contacted his good friend Alfred Hitchcock for help on a horrific project. Mr. Bernstein the chief of the film section of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force had been present at the Nazi extermination camp Bergen-Belsen in April that year soon after its liberation. The film he was preparing would serve as irrefutable evidence of Nazi atrocities and be shown to Germans and to the world. Mr. Bernstein wanted it to ���be in the form of a prosecuting counsel stating his case.�� Hitchcock��s contribution seems to have been advisory; he suggested for instance that the film use long takes to affirm the material��s authenticity." the film builds its case rapidly and unblinkingly. It looks back at 1933 and the rise of National Socialism ��� using images of Hitler among the masses from the propaganda film ���Triumph of the Will�� ��� then skips forward to a number of recently liberated extermination camps. Some of this imagery will likely be familiar and not just to those who have watched other Holocaust documentaries. One of the eerie truths of this film is that however difficult it is to watch it can seem shocking but not surprising simply because such imagery has been so thoroughly incorporated into pop culture either through direct citation or by inference." it has been at last completed and restored and is now receiving a commercial release under the exacting straightforward title ���German Concentration Camps Factual Survey.�� The title��s blandness is appropriate given the bluntness of the prosecutorial narration (read by an actor Jasper Britton) and the unsparingly graphic evidentiary visuals. Most of the film consists of material shot inside and near several extermination camps including Dachau and Auschwitz; much of the imagery is heart-crushing and extremely tough to watch consisting of newly freed skeletal men women and children and thousands of corpses." in Britain where the original elements had been kept. Its history is long and tangled. It began as an Allied endeavor and according to the historian Toby Haggith the director of the restoration was meant to include concluding statements from President Harry S. Truman Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. (Dr. Haggith has written a useful concise history of the documentary that is available on the British Film Institute��s website.) The Americans however opted to produce their own film ���Death Mills�� (1946) directed by Billy Wilder. Mr. Bernstein continued working on the original project; Hitchcock Mr. Haggith writes may have contributed to the script." including a brief introduction that offers critical viewing context. Just as crucial though is a longer postscript that includes interviews with some of the principals involved in the Imperial War Museums�� restoration. They contribute more on the film��s complex history but they also talk about how hard this material is to watch offering a much-needed humanizing coda. One man suggests that you may at times need to close your eyes; mostly though you need to watch."

�� his name is the biggest hook on which the movie hangs. Playing Eddie a Mississippi crime boss he hides beneath impenetrable shades a dead-beaver wig and a joke shop nose-and-mustache combo ��� a disguise that reprises the one he wore as another Eddie in the 1993 thriller ���Deadfall.�� This time it frees him to indulge a character distinguished mainly by flying-spittle rages which the cinematographer Brandon Cox captures with undeserving and wobbly reverence." much like the movies around them have bordered on cartoonish. An intelligent occasionally eccentric actor Mr. Cage has offbeat skills that have been best showcased by directors ��� like Martin Scorsese Norman Jewison and Andrew Niccol ��� who know when to rein him in and when to let him fly." Miss. grow up to embrace very different lives. While the younger sweats honestly in his own construction company the elder is a small-time hood who owes Eddie a debt he can��t repay. At least not without putting Family above family." ���Arsenal�� is hobbled mainly by its director��s histrionic tendencies. Every bludgeoning needs an invisible gospel choir; every pummeling seems rendered in leering slow-motion. Come for the grungy Biloxi setting; stay for the stun grenade."

and there are no succinct summations of the timeline or the issues as in a traditional documentary a decision that costs the film some urgency. The speakers meander and the film seems unfocused. But perhaps that��s the point. A recurring theme of the speakers is that they are resigned to having their concerns disregarded; it is they say just another example in a long history of cavalier treatment of American Indians and their heritage. Certainly at this point the oil work is not going to be stopped. Mr. Brook and Ms. Wells are in a sense not documenting a controversy at all; they are capturing an endemic heartbreaking defeatism." having the odd effect of making the issues seem less urgent than they are but at least it lets opponents of the drilling be heard at longer than sound-bite length." Hidatsa and Arikara Nation have caused all sorts of upheaval and have left residents divided over whether the oil revenue is a good or a bad thing. The filmmakers Simon Brook (writer and director) and Jane Wells (writer and producer) basically allow a handful of opponents to talk at length about their concerns. (The pro-oil faction gets only a brief hearing.) The worries cover a broad range: environmental degradation disruption of ancestral lands and traditions demographic changes uneven distribution of the oil revenue and more."
