���Railroad Tigers ��� directed by Ding Sheng is kind of a mess. It opens as if it were a kid���s film then applies a light slapstick touch to a ���let���s take out the railroad bridge��� scenario that gets harder to maintain as the casualties mount. The movie���s contempt for its Japanese characters reaches a peculiar culmination in a scene in which ritual suicide is played for laughs. It���s heartening to see Mr. Chan who plays the avuncular leader of the guerrillas demonstrating that he���s still game but you wish his energy were being expended in more consistently enjoyable pictures." argumentative but largely cheerful batch of Chinese guerrillas intent on sabotaging the Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War ��� strategize over meals or regroup in a cave after an attack are pleasantly reminiscent of this genre���s offerings from Asia in the 1970s and early ���80s period pieces or not. And of course there���s Jackie Chan the performer who���s the sound era���s heir to Buster Keaton." Mr. Chan doesn���t mount the kind of jaw-dropping death-defying stunt work that he used to do (nor should he be expected to). He nevertheless remains an impressive physical performer. Clever and resourceful he���s found a new way into the action: Instead of driving it he now dazzles us by sidestepping it. In a fight scene atop a moving train Mr. Chan lets younger stuntmen jump and fly and punch while the star himself finds elegant methods of getting out of their way."

who are either bitter about the loss of a loved one to the opioid painkillers he once liberally prescribed ��� in one case about 90 000 pills over a two-year period ��� or mourning the removal of their pipeline to chronic-pain relief. Interviewing both camps Ms. Marson (who also had a hand in writing the film) nudges the narrative neither one way nor the other preferring to step back and let her interviewees speak for themselves." Dr. Hurwitz the self-described product of a liberal household appears a complacent and well-fed advocate for a no-dose-is-too-high philosophy. His forthright ex-wife Nilse Quercia likens him to Isaac Bashevis Singer���s hapless literary hero Gimpel the Fool a man who has faith in sometimes undeserving people. Viewers might not be quite so charitable." Dr. William Hurwitz the subject of Eve Marson���s catchily titled and infuriatingly vague documentary ���Dr. Feelgood: Dealer or Healer? ��� faces the camera with a benign smile. For someone who has endured two criminal trials for narcotics distribution and served almost five years in prison he seems remarkably at peace." Ms. Marson nevertheless contributes to the film���s general fuzziness by failing to clarify the legal and moral guidelines that govern these kinds of prescriptions. No medical ethicist is called to support or rebut Dr. Hurwitz���s belief that it was not his job to police patients ��� or to withhold treatment because they were selling the drugs." this laissez-faire approach results in competing personal stories ��� unfussily captured in direct-to-camera setups ��� that yank our sympathies both toward Dr. Hurwitz and away from him. Was he a compassionate godsend to those whose agony had been played down or discounted by previous physicians? Or was he a gullible perhaps criminal accomplice to patients who were conning him to feed an addiction or resell their prescriptions?" though is the realization that the two charges are not mutually exclusive. Presenting evidence for both Ms. Marson includes law enforcement officials who investigated Dr. Hurwitz as part of a long-term effort to control a rising painkiller epidemic. As a result blame ricochets from patient to doctor to Big Pharma (whose representatives declined to appear in the film) without sticking to anyone."

titled ���Love Poem ��� opens with a simple direct declaration about a humble household object matches: ���Currently our favorite brand is Ohio Blue Tip.��� At first the writing is precise concrete and pictorial and includes descriptions of both the boxes with their ���dark and light blue and white labels ��� and of the matches with their ���one-and-a-half-inch soft pine stem.��� With a flourish (like that of a lighted match) the language veers into the metaphoric (the match heads are ���sober and furious���) only to end with soaring lyricism and a love note: ���I become the cigarette and you the match.���" dancing squiggles and twinned images ��� fill ���Paterson ��� creating a vibrant visual punctuation to the otherwise relaxed storytelling. Mr. Jarmusch likes to take it nice and easy and this movie is fairly low-key even by his fairly chill standards. Paterson���s work demands consistency routine punctuation and safety (no speedy action-flick escapades here) which create a kind of meditative flow. Passengers come and go embarking and disembarking and talking or kidding about this and that. Paterson cocks an ear to listen to this human babble bobbing in and out of its stream before heading over to the city���s magnificent Great Falls to eat lunch." Paterson spends time with Laura his stay-at-home partner (she shares her name with Petrarch���s love) who nurtures her passions mostly by adorning every surface ��� walls curtains and even clothes ��� with patterns. Laura is the movie���s one minor letdown partly because she seems more frivolous than Paterson with pursuits that are more hobbies than they are brow-furrowing art. He writes poems and reads deeply; she bakes cupcakes (she���s a whiz with a pastry bag) and buys a guitar off YouTube announcing her unlikely dream of becoming a country singer. She���s an appealing lightly comic figure whose main job is to be Paterson���s helpmate ��� his chef cheerleader and of course muse." ��� Jim Jarmusch���s wonderful new dispatch from Jarmusch-land. Sometimes they appear over water too surfacing word by word on images of the Great Falls along the Passaic River in Paterson N.J. No pen or pencil directly spells out these words no clattering keyboard or banging typewriter. Instead the words ��� in a neat cramped hand ��� appear onscreen as they are read aloud by their author Paterson (Adam Driver) a soulful bus driver and basement poet. It���s as if he were beaming his heart-song straight from his head into yours." and borrowed its name for his multipart epic poem which he wrote involves ���the resemblance between the mind of modern man and a city.��� He opens the first of its volumes by declaring ���Rigor of beauty is the quest ��� only to ask ���But how will you find beauty when it is locked in the mind past all remonstrance?���" of course but it���s a strangely old-fashioned his-and-her configuration for a director like Mr. Jarmusch whose work otherwise evades creaky norms. It���s a minor complaint in a movie that is otherwise pretty flawless which takes thinking creating and beauty seriously but also includes a delectably funny slow-building sight gag and plenty of shameless doggy reaction shots courtesy of Marvin (Nellie a scene stealer) the couple���s bulldog and Paterson���s nemesis. There���s also some low-burning comedy in the local bar where each evening Paterson ties Marvin outside and drops in for some conversation with the bartender Doc (Barry Shabaka Henley) whose nickname is likely a nod to another doc William Carlos Williams." creation and how images become words (and vice versa) ���Paterson��� seems deceptively simple. Its hero Paterson works in (where else?) Paterson. Every weekday he rises early kisses his beloved Laura (Golshifteh Farahani) and heads off to work where he turns the ignition on a big city bus and rumbles into the bright world. Some of that world comes to him clambering onboard in a blur of ages hues and conversational interests. Mostly Paterson looks out through the bus���s windows views that turn life into discretely framed images." its rhythms determined by labor and the old Monday through Friday routine. Like most people���s workweeks his story opens on a Monday that word stamped on the screen. Dividing stories into units of time into hours and days is a familiar structuring device sometimes used for suspense or to create a countdown. Stanley Kubrick inserted days on title cards in ���The Shining ��� jumping from ���Tuesday��� to ���Thursday ��� a gap that suggests that something is amiss with time itself and that amps the unease. In ���Paterson ��� by contrast the march of days announces both the regimentation of Paterson���s punch-clock obligations and the story���s structure its pattern." out of particulars and make them general ��� adding that all we know is our ���own complexities.��� As Paterson writes Mr. Jarmusch sometimes fills the screen with particulars ��� Laura���s face the crashing falls ��� superimposing them as if to suggest ideas swirling into words patterns and poetry." the material to the transcendent ��� happens in ���Paterson��� as days pass details accumulate and words turn into poetry one line at a time. Things happen to Paterson ��� he has a rough Friday and Saturday though a better Sunday ��� but Mr. Jarmusch doesn���t turn problems into drama. Life is enough. Instead with visual precision and emotional restraint ��� and aided by Mr. Driver���s tamped-down sober and gently endearing performance ��� Mr. Jarmusch creates that rarest portrait of the artist: the one who���s happy being hard at work."

who smokes like a Frenchwoman and reads Judy Blume shares battle stories and wounds from the sexual front. Abbie gives Jamie records and books including ���Our Bodies Ourselves ��� that liberatory classic about women���s health and sexuality. It���s as eye-opening for Jamie as ���Sisterhood Is Powerful ��� the radical feminist anthology that he first opens with almost spiritual reverence ��� or is it trepidation? (Later when he explains the female orgasm to an acquaintance one of those playground braggarts the other guy pummels him.) Jamie���s sentimental education is also a kind of encounter session." as second-wave feminists liked to say and so it is in ���20th Century Women.��� The politics sneak up on you filtered through the intimate lives of its electrically alive characters. Jamie is the story���s hub the center from which everything and everyone ostensibly radiates but Dorothea is its reason for being. She sets the pieces into place and motion; she���s the inspiration and guiding spirit the story���s balm and soul. She���s also the one who after Jamie lands in the hospital after a heart-leaping foolish stunt enlists Abbie and Julie to help raise Jamie. Dorothea���s a with-it mom from tousled hair to Birkenstocked toe but she���s also unsettled by the world." which deepens the movie. People are mysterious and parents are too partly because you never really catch up to them. So you take stock stare at family photographs and sift through mementos. Mr. Mills does something similar narratively as he samples the era���s music signposts and shards all while circling Dorothea. Fittingly given the title in ���20th Century Women ��� he also situates her in history. (The character is named after the photographer Dorothea Lange.) ���My mom was born in 1924 ��� Jamie says in voice-over early as the screen fills with black-and-white footage of period despair. Those ghostly images stick with you even after the story lightens. Mr. Mills has worked in graphic design and as a music-video director and while setting up the story he folds in snapshot-like scenes from Jamie and Dorothea���s origin stories from a ravishing oceanic opening shot to her Depression roots him as a grasping newborn infant and Gerald Ford stumbling. There���s a kind of restlessness in the way these images pile up to the movie���s accumulation of album covers its books snatches of jazz and glimpses of Humphrey Bogart making love to Ingrid Bergman. It���s as if Mr. Mills were riffling through an encyclopedia searching for the perfect entry which he���s creating before your eyes." Mr. Mills is uncommonly generous. Abbie Julie and William who sexily floats around the periphery (Mr. Crudup is superb at not quite stealing his scenes) are so persuasively detailed that all three could spin off into a separate movie; each has both sting and tenderness nearing grace. Yet these three and even Jamie pale next to Dorothea who���s satisfyingly complex especially for a movie mother. Dorothea is at once laid back and uptight which Ms. Bening conveys with moments of shambling gestural looseness and sudden emotional spikiness. She floods the screen with warmth threatens to burn the joint down and with Mr. Mills turns contradictions into character." the teenage Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann in a heartbreakingly sincere turn). Mother and child live in Santa Barbara that drowsy well-heeled coastal city north of Los Angeles. There Dorothea is raising Jamie in a roomy stately 1905 fixer-upper that she���s renovating with the help of a boarder William (Billy Crudup). Another lodger an artist Abbie (Greta Gerwig) helps keep their communal life jumping as does Jamie���s friend Julie (Elle Fanning) who likes to cuddle platonically with him at night sharing secrets as he tries to keep his hormones and body from betraying him." ���Beginners ��� was a lightly comic fictionalized weepie about his father who came out of the closet in his mid-70s when his son was an adult. Now Mr. Mills has turned to his mother in another fictionalized story moistened with tears that draws on his life. This time though he has turned back the clock for a portrait of his mother as she was when he was a teenager and didn���t yet entirely grasp her extraordinariness. Whether she was as remarkable as the woman onscreen seems entirely beside the point ��� ���20th Century Women��� is a memory movie one in which people are conjured up to bump against the larger world exuberantly and uneasily." complete with skateboarding dancing loving and lived-in talk. A lot of that chatter is humorous ��� often gentle and wry on rare occasion uproarious ��� but there���s also a powerful undertow of loss running through the movie. There are sorrows and tragedies one involving a story thread that allows Ms. Gerwig to root around in grief and a scene in which she uncomfortably hilariously clears the room. For her part Ms. Fanning drifts in and out like a dream (Jamie���s and Mr. Mills���s) a magnificent emissary from that seductive land called Young and Beautiful. You simultaneously see the girl Julie is and the girl that she���s on the verge of leaving behind." ��� a funny emotionally piercing story about a teenager and the women who raise him. It opens in 1979 when cool kids danced to Talking Heads (���This ain���t no party this ain���t no disco���) and President Carter bummed everyone out talking about our ���crisis of confidence.��� There���s something in the air ��� or so it seems although the California light here tends to blot out the shadows. When a car bursts into flames soon after the movie opens it looks about as threatening as an art installation. Apocalypse later man."

She goes without food to feed her children is caught shoplifting groceries and in a moment of desperation at a food bank tears the lid off a can of beans and pours the syrup into her mouth." a 59-year-old widowed carpenter recovering from a heart attack waits to connect with a government representative in the first of many infuriating phone calls.

��� written and directed by Maren Ade is its own kind of rebellion a thrilling act of defiance against the toxicity of doing what is expected on film at work and out in the world. It is named for its improbable hero the outrageous alter ego Winfried impersonates during his visit to Bucharest. Accessorizing those awful teeth with a stringy black wig a baggy sharkskin suit and the kind of two-toned dress shirts favored by insecure business-class big shots Erdmann shows up wherever he is likely to cause Ines the most embarrassment variously claiming to be the German ambassador and a freelance management coach. Ines isn���t fooled by the costume of course and it���s not always clear whether her colleagues believe Erdmann���s nonsense or are playing along with a joke they don���t quite get. Nor are Winfried���s intentions entirely legible at least at first. Is he trying to humiliate his daughter or to save her soul?" she has rebelled by joining the establishment. Everything about her ��� her omnipresent cellphone her crisply tailored blazers her trim physique and curt manner ��� can seem like a calculated rebuke to her anarchic dad. She dares him to judge her and when he does she strikes back dismissing his na��ve pious criticisms of her turbo-capitalist lifestyle. Navigating deals and presentations managing difficult clients and sexist colleagues she is living in the real world and fighting for a place in it." skeptical spirit is in any case more diagnostic than prescriptive. Like its hero it wants to shake its audience at least for the moment out of habits of complacency and compromise to alter our perceptions and renew our sense of what is possible. There are things you will look at differently after seeing ���Toni Erdmann.��� A short list might include petits fours cheese graters team-building exercises and a certain song immortalized by Whitney Houston. Also German comedies Bulgarian costumes Romanian hotels fatherhood and the anxious absurd state of the human race in the 21st century." conducted in a sterile modern office building in Bucharest about the meaning of the English word ���performance.��� For Anca (Ingrid Bisu) a young Romanian employed by a global consulting firm it refers to the way she does her job and more than that her ability to obey the norms and protocols of the corporate workplace. Her boss she explains gives her ���a lot of feedback ��� which is clearly a euphemism." a fearsomely serious executive named Ines (Sandra H�_ller) happens to be the daughter of Winfried the man Anca is talking with. It is already clear that Winfried (Peter Simonischek) a shambling unshaven music teacher with a mop of gray hair and a prankish sense of humor has ideas about public and professional behavior that would raise alarms in any human resources department. He carries a set of joke-shop fake teeth in his shirt pocket and has a habit of disrupting the routines of everyday life with absurd and outrageous improvisations. If for Anca and Ines performance is a synonym for conformity for Winfried it���s the opposite. To perform ��� to act out to pretend to take on a new and unexpected personality ��� is above all to lodge an existential protest against the standardization of life." most simply but also most elusively a sweet and thorny tale of father-daughter bonding with a finely honed edge of generational conflict propelled by two extraordinarily natural utterly fearless performances. Winfried a shaggy baby boomer has had the luxury of conflating irresponsibility with idealism. Amicably divorced from Ines���s mother devoted to his own mother and his aging dog he has settled into a permanent pleasant state of not-quite-adulthood in which he reserves the right not to take anything too seriously." who at 40 is closer to being Ines���s peer than Winfried���s is sympathetic to both of them but not exactly neutral. ���Toni Erdmann ��� her third feature may look like farce ��� and it does achieve heights of pure giddy silliness of a kind rarely seen on the big screen these days ��� but it is driven by a savage satirical energy a thoroughgoing critique of the way things are.

Erdmann may be able to save Ines but it���s not clear who will save Romania." ��� he sighs at one point still in disguise when Ines is out of earshot.

��� Ben Affleck plays one of those romanticized antiheroes that movie stars love to suit up for sometimes with a fedora. Over the decades these types have changed their looks and histories but there���s a sameness to how they escape the law and the routine hum of everyday life; how they use guns ruthlessly or reluctantly; skip out on church yet live by their own moral code; and inevitably rise to become masters of their worlds as well as of the most beautiful women in the room. They���re fantasies of power partly because no matter how hard this type falls his power never truly corrupts." unfocused movie about ambition lost ideals corrupt men and a thief whose idea of life on his own terms means pulling the trigger. It has Tommy guns and Model T���s luxuriously polished surfaces some fine squealing-tire action and a handful of solid performances including one from Sienna Miller who tramps around as a 10-cents-a-dance cynic. But what���s most striking about the movie is its earnestness. Mr. Affleck isn���t playing with genre for kicks or as a knowing reflexive exercise but trying to pour new wine into a bullet-riddled vessel." ��� a gangster movie set in the 1920s. He plays Joe Coughlin a World War I veteran who���s returned from the war with a mouth full of tough-guy talk that basically boils down to ���I went away a soldier I came home an outlaw.��� Mr. Affleck recites this line with a gravelly hush as if he were spilling a secret but whatever Joe has learned in the bloody fields of Europe remains mostly obscured; what speaks loudly is his proficiency with a gun and the easy way in which he shoots at a man in a uniform even if that man wears a badge." ��� making its heaviness ponderous. At the same time there���s something appealing in how Mr. Affleck comes at the gangster genre and how this story departs from the tribal affiliations of films like ���The Departed��� toward a more pluralistic vision in tune with both today���s and yesterday���s United States. In ���Live by Night ��� Joe ends up thriving in a mixed neighborhood and rubbing elbows with people of different hues yet this is scarcely an advertisement for so-called political correctness. If anything he���s just another regular Joe robbing killing and swaggering his way to the American dream one bullet at a time." ���Live by Night��� tracks Joe from his early Boston crime sprees and Oedipal issues to his escalating involvement in a crime syndicate. (Brendan Gleeson pops up early on as Joe���s policeman father.) Joe eventually lands in Tampa Fla. where he builds a Prohibition empire tangles with the sheriff (Chris Cooper) and falls in love with a local attraction (Zoe Saldana) who changes his ideas about life. There are complications involving the sheriff���s daughter (Elle Fanning) other gangsters and the Ku Klux Klan all of which are crammed amid intrigues locations cinematic homages and too many self-flattering scenes for Mr. Affleck." especially if ��� as Mr. Affleck does here ��� you���re trying to say something important about homegrown myths involving progress and exceptionalism. One hurdle is that our gangster movies are almost by definition about the dark side of the American dream one that sexes up the Horatio Alger fairy tale with sin and violence only to then sometimes toss Horatio and his dream in the gutter. James Cagney machine-gunned his way to that dream in ���The Public Enemy��� in 1931. Decades later an aggrieved father opened ���The Godfather��� with his own singular pledge of allegiance: ���I believe in America.���" but his biggest problem is that he���s fallen for his leading man. He gave himself a good role in ���Argo ��� one of the earlier movies he directed (in the first ���Gone Baby Gone ��� he stayed off camera). But in ���Argo ��� he was also embedded in that movie���s enjoyably loony complications and upstaged by a couple of world-class scene-stealers in Alan Arkin and John Goodman. In ���Live by Night ��� by contrast Mr. Affleck grabs the center and doesn���t let go partly it seems because he���s invested in being a movie star. (Certainly that���s the only rational explanation for ���Batman v Superman ��� other than the paycheck.)" uglier and more brutal but Mr. Affleck has never been an actor who can persuasively go for the jugular and he can���t help but smooth the rough edges. This softening undercuts some of Mr. Affleck���s big moments as when Joe faces down a Ku Klux Klan grand wizard a scene that ends up feeling more about affirming Joe���s superiority than advancing the story. At that moment and elsewhere Joe scarcely seems the complex conflicted man who lives by night even as he���s increasingly drawn into the day. He comes off like a different fantasy one that���s a shotgun wedding between 20th-century pulp clich��s and 21st-century elevated political consciousness."

a belief in absolutes that will be tested. His resoluteness even seems answered by the calm camerawork (no jitters here) which early on is dramatically punctuated by a ravishing overhead shot of the three Jesuit priests gliding down a flight of stony bleach-white stairs as if they were being looked down on from high above." he agonizes with no self-awareness does God not answer prayers and alleviate suffering a question which proves too heavy a load for Mr. Garfield���s talents. When he plays against the other actors he can seem as decorative as a plaster saint (his luxuriously styled hair is right out of a 1950s biblical epic) which makes the other performers and their characters look stronger and works for the story. Rodrigues is weak. But it���s weakness without depth or the burning belief that would make his errors shattering. When he carries on alone speaking to God questioning and suffering at great monotonous length his weakness becomes tedious as does the film." notably Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who as gaunt and tormented as any martyred Caravaggio saint watches in gaping horror as guards ladle water from hot springs on shrieking Christians. Rodrigues learns about this hellish scene from Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds) who also relates that Ferreira has renounced his religion and is living as ���a Japanese.��� Rodrigues having studied with Ferreira refuses to accept that the older priest���s belief has been shattered and departs for Japan accompanied by another priest Father Garupe (a fine underused Adam Driver) and a Japanese guide Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka excellent)." Rodrigues and Garupe make contact with a village of hidden Christians who live in fear of the authorities and a cobralike smiler known as the Inquisitor Inoue (Issey Ogata in one of the film���s strongest performances). By day the priests hide in a small cramped hut near the village; by night they lead their new flock in dimly lighted rooms delivering sermons in Latin baptizing children and taking confession. Mr. Scorsese draws some modest uneasy comedy from the linguistic and cultural differences between the priests and their congregation as when a grabby highly agitated woman begs the rather startled Garupe to hear her confession." it is very much the point of view of the movie���s own creator. This overhead shot and others suggest that there���s a divine aspect to the priests��� mission an idea that Mr. Scorsese visually and narratively underlines in the Lazarus-like cave in which Rodrigues and Garupe first take shelter in Japan; in Rodrigues���s self-aggrandizing identification with Jesus; and crucially through the figure of Judas. As in Mr. Scorsese���s 1988 film ���The Last Temptation of Christ ��� his messy excitingly alive adaptation of that Nikos Kazantzakis novel Judas must play a part in ���Silence��� because without him there can be no Jesus." as did John Updike; for years Mr. Scorsese tried to turn it into a film. (He wrote the foreword for a recent edition.) Filled with reams of religious dialogue the novel fictionalizes history ��� the 17th-century purging of Christianity in Japan ��� as a means to explore religious faith and cultural difference. What preoccupies Endo is whether Western Christianity can take root in what the Inquisitor describes as ���this swamp of Japan ��� which seems inhospitable to outside forces. It���s a story of God nation and myth." more trembling more surrealism; maybe as in ���The Last Temptation of Christ ��� a talking lion to go along with its trippy lizard. ���Silence��� is as visually striking as you might expect but also overly tidy clean and decorous despite its tortured flesh its mud and its blood. There���s a crushing lack of urgency to this story and its telling perhaps because it took Mr. Scorsese who wrote the script with Jay Cocks so long to make ���Silence.��� It���s disappointing because few directors can engage doubt and belief as powerfully as Mr. Scorsese can but also because doubt and belief have again set the world on fire." from the religious guilt that afflicts Harvey Keitel���s thug in ���Mean Streets��� (���You don���t make up for your sins in the church.���) through that circle of hell known as ���The Wolf of Wall Street.��� In ���Silence��� the struggle begins in a mist-wreathed landscape where severed human heads rest on a crude shelf like trophies of some ghastly victory. Today decapitations in the name of religion are a gruesome hallmark of Islamist extremists but here they introduce a dispute involving the Japanese authorities who intent on maintaining the country���s power and isolation are set on eradicating Christianity its proselytizers and converts." Father Rodrigues who in 1643 heads into the dark heart of Japan where Christians are being persecuted ��� boiled alive immolated and crucified. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) sets out to help keep the church alive in Japan a mission that perhaps inevitably leads to God. The film���s solemnity is seductive ��� as is Mr. Scorsese���s art ��� especially in light of the triviality and primitiveness of many movies even if its moments of greatness also make its failures seem more pronounced." the exchange feels forced and comes across as a bid to lighten the gloom; if anything it turns a feverish plea for absolution into a bit of vaudeville. There���s something uncomfortably and literally childlike about this child of God who like the other villagers with their pleading eyes and hands seems like a relic from a white-savior myth. Kichijiro who enters grunting and twitching as if in homage to Toshiro Mifune and grovels at the priest���s feet also seems on hand as much for comic relief as for guidance. Yet even as the film seems to share the outsider perspectives of Rodrigues and Garupe instructively it is the village elders ��� brilliantly played by Yoshi Oida and Shinya Tsukamoto ��� who give these scenes flesh bone and pain." black vestments and narrative prominence he is no more a Hollywood hero than most of Mr. Scorsese���s falling and fallen men with their arrogance and vanity. Rodrigues cowers in fear recoils from his flock and assures himself of the goodness that the church ��� and he by extension ��� has brought. (He pities the worshipers but is proud of his ministering.) His faith including in himself sustains Rodrigues but even as he tends to the souls of the hidden Christians he fails to ease their earthly suffering. God is silent; in a way so is this most ardent missionary." but its messenger is too pallid. This is less the fault of Mr. Garfield than of Mr. Scorsese���s conception of Rodrigues as the story���s fulcrum instead of its void. Mr. Scorsese fills the film with haunting tableaus and performances ��� including from Tadanobu Asano as the Interpreter ��� that tug from the edges pulling attention away from its center. In the end nothing that Rodrigues says resonates as deeply as Inoue���s terrifying teasing whine which conveys the larger cultural and political stakes; nothing imparts the mystery of creation as potently as the flicker of a darting emerald lizard or an eerie parade of cats prowling through a spookily deserted village."

The racism they face does not depend on the viciousness or virtue of individual white people and for the most part the white characters are not treated as heroes for deciding at long last to behave decently. Two of them however are singled out for commendation: John Glenn portrayed by Glen Powell as a natural democrat with no time for racial hierarchies; and Al Harrison the head of Katherine���s group for whom the success of the mission is more important than color." who plays Al is an actor almost uniquely capable of upstaging through understatement. He is also one of the great gum-chewers in American cinema a habit that along with the flattop haircut and heavy-framed glasses gives Al an aura of midcentury no-nonsense masculine competence. He desegregates the NASA bathrooms with a sledgehammer and stands up for Katherine in quieter but no less emphatic ways when her qualifications are challenged." when racial segregation and workplace sexism were widely accepted facts of life and the word ���computer��� referred to a person not a machine.

She receives a cold welcome ��� particularly from an engineer named Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) ��� and is not spared the indignities facing a black woman in a racially segregated gender-stratified workplace. The only bathroom she is allowed to use is in a distant building and she horrifies her new co-workers when she helps herself to a cup of coffee." maybe but Mr. Costner as usual does what he can to give the white men of America a good name. The movie meanwhile expands the schoolbook chronicle of the conquest of space beyond the usual heroes restoring some of its idealism and grandeur in the process. It also embeds that history in daily life departing from the televised spectacle of liftoffs and landings and the public drama of the civil rights movement to spend time with its heroines and their families at home and in church. The sweetest subplot involves the romance between Katherine a widow with three daughters and a handsome military officer played by Mahershala Ali." ��� Jeff Nichols���s film about the Virginia couple who challenged their state���s law against interracial marriage which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1967. The two movies take place in the same state in the same era and focus on the quiet dramas that move history forward. They introduce you to real people you might wish you had known more about earlier. They can fill you with outrage at the persistence of injustice and gratitude toward those who had the grit to stand up against it." whose previous film was the heart-tugging borderline-treacly Bill Murray vehicle ���St. Vincent ��� knows how to push our emotional buttons without too heavy a hand. He trusts his own skill the intrinsic interest of the material and ��� above all ��� the talent and dedication of the cast. From one scene to the next you may know more or less what is coming but it is never less than delightful to watch these actors at work." the film directed by Theodore Melfi (who wrote the script with Allison Schroeder) turns the entwined careers of Katherine Goble (later Johnson) Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan into a rousing celebration of merit rewarded and perseverance repaid. Like many movies about the overcoming of racism it offers belated acknowledgment of bravery and talent and an overdue reckoning with the sins of the past. And like most movies about real-world breakthroughs ���Hidden Figures��� is content to stay within established conventions. The story may be new to most viewers but the manner in which it���s told will be familiar to all but the youngest." who is in charge of several dozen computers is repeatedly denied promotion to supervisor and treated with condescension by her immediate boss (Kirsten Dunst).

Julieta���s experiences ��� love marriage motherhood small-town life ��� are drawn from a trilogy of linked short stories by the Canadian writer (and Nobel laureate) Alice Munro.

They raise a daughter Antia amid ocean breezes and under the watchful eye of a busybody (the Almod�_var fixture Rossy de Palma).

But the cramming of information into an average-length feature film only undermines it in this adaptation." but the filmmakers are really pushing it here. (The Assassin���s Creed video game series is much admired for the accuracy of its historical detail.) In any event the movie then shows the opponents of the Templars the Assassins carrying out rituals before battle and professing the titular creed before engaging in blade-wielding violence.

Solitary confinement even amid opulence is solitary torture." this creepy premise haunts your imagination. And the contrast between the chilly impersonality of the Avalon and the anguish of its human cargo lends the first half of the movie a desperate poignancy. Were I in Jim���s shoes I would also drown my sorrows nightly the way he does at the well-stocked bar tended by a friendly android Arthur (an amusing Michael Sheen)." ��� and its name is Jennifer Lawrence.

Buster Moon (voiced by Matthew McConaughey) a koala of some winsomeness and no small enthusiasm decides to revive his fortunes with a singing competition.

���Patriots Day��� is at its best as a vivid re-creation of the measures and resources needed to conduct investigations of such catastrophic crimes. The police get their backs up slightly when the F.B.I. team led by Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) shows up and the film is frank in its depiction of what can fall through the cracks as well as what can be accomplished when multiple agencies try to collaborate." the brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; Tamerlan���s wife Katherine Russell (Melissa Benoist); and Tamerlan and Katherine���s toddler daughter Zahira. Their little household is shown squabbling over milk for the baby on the morning of the bombing. This is about as humanizing as the depiction of the terrorists gets." particularly when they���re made so soon after the actual events. As it happens ���Patriots Day��� works so well on a dramatic level that my qualms were silenced almost entirely from the start." but those in the roles of law enforcement parties ��� Mr. Wahlberg Mr. Bacon John Goodman J. K. Simmons and Jake Picking among them ��� are particularly convincing. The movie also provides especially in a firefight scene between the brothers and the police a simultaneously bracing and dispiriting account of just how much havoc a pair of heavily armed moral weaklings can wreak when they are so determined. The film also has a longer-than-usual coda featuring interviews with the real figures fictionalized in the movie which is commendable. My reservations about such pictures in general were not put to rest by ���Patriots Day ��� but this film���s real merits are not easily dismissed either." ���Lone Survivor��� from 2013 chronicled an unsuccessful 2005 Navy SEAL mission to kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan. This year���s ���Deepwater Horizon��� was about a fatal 2010 disaster involving an oil rig collapse off the Louisiana coast. Now comes ���Patriots Day ��� about the Boston Marathon bombing of April 15 2013." which Mr. Berg wrote with Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer (Eric Johnson and Paul Tamasy contributed to the story) divides the movie into several story lines focusing on specific individuals. Although Mr. Wahlberg���s character a police detective who���s working off a suspension by doing uniformed duty at the marathon is a fictionalized composite almost all of the other characters ��� from Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to the newlyweds played by Rachel Brosnahan and Christopher O���Shea ��� are based on real people." while Dzhokhar (Alex Wolff) is repellently trivial-minded in his sense of entitlement. When the brothers hijacked a terrified young man���s S.U.V. which they are considering driving to New York to plant more bombs Dzhokhar���s almost immediate concern is whether it has an iPod dock. The movie���s attitude toward Ms. Russell who has not been accused or charged in connection with the bombings is very aggressive and her portrayal by Ms. Benoist is ice-cold and angry. (This is likely to prove controversial most specifically with Ms. Russell���s lawyers.)" in an aside between F.B.I. agents and local law enforcement it strongly suggests that Tamerlan���s motivations were largely personal. Instead the movie focuses on the community that the bombings intended to tear apart and how Boston and its surrounding towns came together imperfectly but with a steely determination to apprehend the culprits."

Once he���s landed the movie ��� written by Adam Mansbach and directed by Vikram Gandhi ��� follows Barry as he shifts between Columbia where he studies political science and his life off campus where he plays street ball and at times unwinds in a cloud of pot smoke. It���s a somewhat familiar if rather elevated sentimental education with in-class discussions about the ancient Greeks and democracy and an outside world that seems largely defined by its stark black-and-white truths." and why? These questions swirl around him though they���re usually conveyed through dramatic situations rather than in dialogue. That makes sense given this movie isn���t about Barack but a kid named Barry who���s unsettled and doesn���t know where he belongs. He���s divided existentially and every which way living in Harlem and rooming with Will (Ellar Coltrane) a pleasantly innocuous white guy." a kind of third way that is an alternative to both the mostly white world of Columbia and the black world that Barry eagerly tentatively seeks out. This sounds more schematic than it plays. The movie���s lived-in realism puts Barry on the ground rather than in the air where he experiences the usual coming-of-age agonies and joys. Here he also endures and enjoys with winces and tenderness a visit from his mother Ann (a lovely Ashley Judd) and absorbs lessons on the basketball court including from a black friend PJ (Jason Mitchell). Every so often Barry takes out a letter from his father. The future beckons but for now he���s here." including in the Ivy League Barry pals around with white acquaintances and soon has a white girlfriend Charlotte (Anya Taylor-Joy) who���s in one of his classes. They connect kind of cute at a party where Barry flinches at the frat-boy scene and quickly settle into adorably geeky coupledom. On an early date they eagerly tune into the mayoral debate ��� Ed Koch���s head looms on the small television ��� before pulling each other���s clothes off perhaps the first time that mayor ever played an aphrodisiac role. Charlotte seems entirely comfortable with Barry as well as with Harlem where she takes him to Sylvia���s and buys him a James Baldwin paperback." this white girl buying this particular black guy a Baldwin book. Mr. Gandhi puts the scene across though largely by not blowing it up into something self-consciously meaningful or telegraphing. (Mr. Terrell does his share too letting unease gently wash over Barry and enter his voice and body.) For the most part Mr. Gandhi keeps the scenes small compact and quiet leaving most of the explosions to Barry���s friend Saleem (Avi Nash) who���s self-consciously slumming it in a hovel while he figures out what to do with his life. In some of the stronger moments Barry and Saleem simply hang out and the air feels thick with inchoate yearning rather than history."

When in 1947 Jackie Robinson broke the major-league color line it was too late for Troy and his bitterness infects his relationship with Cory who is being scouted for college football scholarships. Troy���s other son Lyons (Russell Hornsby) is a musician and the dynamic among the three of them is one of the ways ���Fences��� echoes ���Death of a Salesman.��� Troy���s betrayal of Rose is another." and helps the audience to see it. As incarnated by Ms. Davis she is more than a foil and a helpmate. Her relative reticence makes her not just the film���s conscience but also its central mystery. It falls to Rose to solve the problems her husband has created to smooth over his relationships with his sons and his brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson) a brain-damaged veteran of World War II. She also struggles with a challenge analogous to the one Troy faces one made more complicated by his role in maintaining it." ��� we will have learned a lot about Troy Maxson ��� about his hard Southern childhood his time in prison and the Negro Leagues his work ethic his sexual appetites and his parenting philosophy ��� but the first and most important thing we know about the man is that he is one of the world���s great talkers. He enters the screen on a tide of verbiage jawing with his friend Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and bantering with his wife Rose (Viola Davis). The audience quickly grasps what Rose and Bono have known for years. Troy is by turns funny provocative inspiring and hurtful but one thing he will never be as long as he draws breath is silent." Troy���s redemption is possible because he never had any illusions to begin with. His rigid ideas about work responsibility and manhood constitute not a demand for attention but an assertion of dignity. His cruelty selfishness and shortsightedness are somehow inseparable from his loyalty his steadfastness and his existential courage." mostly ��� to give them a bit more room to move and the audience a little more to look at. Confinement however is a theme implied in the play���s title and opening it up too much would risk diluting the power of watching large personalities colliding in a narrow place." as well as flecks of profanity and poetry. He tells tales and busts chops with unflagging energy at times testing the patience of Rose Bono and his other friends and relations. But mostly Troy who makes no secret of his illiteracy uses language as a tool of analysis a way of explaining what���s on his mind and figuring out the shape of the world he must inhabit."

Their popularity and Neruda���s easygoing populism are a rebuke to the arrogance of the ruling class and the Chilean state. And Mr. Larra�_n���s eye for the rugged beauty of Chile���s protean landscapes implies a similar argument. The poet is open to nature and humanity. The policeman is consumed by rules tactics and procedures." which feels more swashbuckling than desperate. But the film casts a shadow forward in time into the darkness of Chile���s later bloodier period of military rule and beyond that into the political uncertainties of the present in Latin America and elsewhere. Mr. Larra�_n invites us to believe that history is on the side of the poets and the humanists and that art will make fools of politicians and policemen. But he is also aware as Pablo Neruda was that history sometimes has other plans." richer colors and a more buoyant spirit. It is less abrasive than Mr. Larra�_n���s Chilean trilogy and less intensely focused than ���Jackie ��� his new English-language film about Jacqueline Kennedy in the aftermath of her husband���s assassination. But like that unorthodox foray into history this one approaches political issues from an oblique angle looking for the idiosyncrasies and ironies that humanize the pursuit of ideals and the exercise of power." ��� ���No��� (which also starred Mr. Bernal) and ���The Club��� ��� are interested in collaboration as well as resistance in the inner lives of the corrupt as well as the actions of the virtuous. Those movies in particular ���Tony Manero ��� set during the military dictatorship in the 1970s and ���The Club ��� about a group of disgraced priests are studies in claustrophobia with cloudy cinematography and grubby behavior." a creature conjured from crime fiction and touched with philosophical melancholy as well as ruthlessness. Whippet-thin and strait-laced he stands in dour contrast to Neruda a plump sensualist with a robust sense of mischief and an inexhaustible appetite for pleasure. With and without Delia the poet manages to stay one step ahead of his nemesis executing a series of escapes that seem equally inspired by Hitchcock and those old Peter Sellers ���Pink Panther��� movies." but not an entirely unsympathetic character. Neruda is a heroic figure ��� comic and Dionysian brilliant and naughty ��� but his personal Javert is in some ways the film���s protagonist. Neruda is annoyed and sometimes amused by the detective���s doggedness but Peluchonneau is haunted by the poet���s mystique and by a growing sense of his own incompleteness. A curious symbiosis develops between them a dynamic more complex and strange than the simple conflict of good and evil." ��� Pablo Larra�_n���s semifantastical biopic is a warmhearted film about a hot-blooded man that is nonetheless troubled by a subtle perceptible chill. Blending fact with invention it tells the story of a confrontation between an artist (the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda) and an emerging dictatorship and more generally illuminates the endless struggle between political authority and the creative imagination. For anyone who believes that poetry and democracy spring from the same source and provoke the same enemies this movie provides both encouragement and warning." cameras whirling and swooping in 1948 with Neruda (Luis Gnecco) a prominent leftist politician as well as a literary celebrity in a rhetorical war with Chile���s president Gabriel Gonz��lez Videla an erstwhile ally in the process of moving from left to right. When Videla bans the Communist Party Neruda ��� who represents that party in the Chilean Senate ��� goes from opposition figure to outlaw. Much of ���Neruda��� is a shaggy-dog cat-and-mouse game as Neruda and his wife Delia (Mercedes Mor��n) are pursued by Oscar Peluchonneau (Gael Garc�_a Bernal) a preening police inspector who stakes his professional honor on his ability to track down the country���s most famous fugitive."

The four chapters that track the changing seasons are a sly joke about the weather which is always perfect. The magic hour ��� that purple-and-orange twilight cherished by generations of cineastes ��� seems to last for weeks on end. The Griffith Observatory might as well be heaven itself." we might prefer not to choose and in this case we don���t really have to. ���La La Land��� succeeds both as a fizzy fantasy and a hard-headed fable a romantic comedy and a showbiz melodrama a work of sublime artifice and touching authenticity. The artifice lies in the gorgeous colors the suave camera movements and the elegant wide-screen compositions. In the songs and choreography too of course though it has to be said that with one or two exceptions these are more competent than dazzling. You���re more likely to remember what you saw than what you heard." Keith is played by the real-life R&B star John Legend whose affable participation presents an interesting challenge to Seb���s dogmatic traditionalism. It seems doubtful that Mr. Legend would have shown up to perform music that he thought was bad and Keith���s unapologetic commercialism is less a strawman for Seb���s high-mindedness than a plausible counterargument. The difference between selling out and breaking through is not always clear and ���La La Land��� is not so hypocritical as to pretend otherwise." one of a bouquet of compositions written for the movie by Justin Hurwitz with lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul is called ���Another Day of Sun ��� and it is the movie���s way of auditioning for the audience testing our tolerance for a bold blend of nostalgia and novelty. Can a generation raised on ���Glee��� and the ���High School Musical��� franchise and besotted by newfangled stage musicals like ���Book of Mormon��� and ���Hamilton��� find room in its heart for a movie that unabashedly evokes ���The Young Girls of Rochefort��� and ���An American in Paris���?" Mia and Seb (as he���s sometimes called) have a long way to go. They are still swimming in a teeming pool of strivers and seekers. Every car from Glendale to Santa Monica holds an aspiring artist or performer of some kind or other. If they shared their rides the commute might be easier and the smog less heavy but of course part of the point is that each one makes the trip alone." sung by a chipper young woman in a yellow dress is a kind of overture hinting at the theme of the bittersweet fairy tale to follow. She recalls leaving her hometown boyfriend behind to pursue fame and fortune here in La La Land a quaint old nickname for Los Angeles that is also the name of Damien Chazelle���s charming new movie." Seb is a proud purist perpetually oppressed and affronted by the prospect of compromise. To pay the rent he is obliged to take what he regards as demeaning gigs: tickling out Christmas carols and show tunes at a restaurant (the manager is J. K. Simmons the fearsome Oscar-winner from ���Whiplash���); doing ���80s pop hits with a knowingly cheesy cover band; touring with a combo fronted by an old friend who has made it big." which is concerned with the entwined romantic and creative doings of an actress named Mia (who is behind the wheel of a Prius) and a jazz pianist named Sebastian (who is pushing a shiny crimson beater). The kicky opening sequence serves as an audition piece a mini-���Chorus Line��� acquainting us with the crowd from which these two gorgeous faces will emerge. Mia���s face belongs to Emma Stone Sebastian���s to Ryan Gosling so you know what I���m talking about." able to express emotion in nonmusical scenes with candor and conviction but a little stiff-limbed and wobbly-voiced when the moment arrives for hoofing and chirping. In this they���re pretty much the opposite of those earlier performers who were vaudevillian troupers before they were thespians." and perhaps the most up-to-date thing about it is the way it explores that ancient conflict. A cynical but not inaccurate way to put this would be to describe it as a careerist movie about careerism. But that would be to slight Mr. Chazelle���s real and uncomfortable insight which is that the drive for professional success is for young people at the present time both more realistic and more romantic than the pursuit of boy-meets-girl happily-ever-after. Love is contingent. Art is commitment." whose previous features (���Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench��� and ���Whiplash���) were full of music and brash youthful energy is a natural showman and a canny craftsman. He wears his influences on his sleeve but he wears them lightly. For all its echoes and allusions ���La La Land��� is too lively and too earnest for mere pastiche. It doesn���t so much look back longingly at past masters like Vincente Minnelli Nicholas Ray Stanley Donen and Jacques Demy (to name a few) as tap into their mojo insisting on their modernity and its own classicism in the same gesture." in any case an entirely plausible millennial affectation. His vintage car has a cassette deck in the dashboard and he lives in a shabby apartment amid stacks of vinyl records and old concert posters. His prized possession is a piano stool that supposedly once belonged to Hoagy Carmichael and he���s upset when his unsentimental sister (the great all-too-briefly seen Rosemarie DeWitt) sits on it." followed by a swirl of rapturous heart-tugging music and ballet ��� effectively cashes the check the rest of the movie has written. On first viewing for the first 90 minutes or so you may find your delight shadowed by skepticism. Where is this going? Can this guy pull it off? Are these kids going to make it? Should we care? By the end those questions vanish under a spell of enchantment." dashing off to audition for small roles in dubious films and television shows. But of course the line between art and junk is also blurry partly because to qualify for the junk you must be absolutely dedicated to your art. Which Mia is in a way that magnifies Ms. Stone���s extraordinary discipline poise and naturalness." a sweltering ribbon of frustration on a Los Angeles freeway. All of a sudden a melody emerges from the squalling of horns and the cacophony of competing radio stations the commuters leap from their cars and a big brazenly sincere movie-musical song-and-dance number is underway." Mr. Chazelle knows how to structure a set to slacken the pace at times in order to build toward a big finish.

The best thing about ���All We Had��� is Ms. Holmes���s stormy portrayal of a desperate foolishly trusting woman who rushes from man to man seeking security only to find herself used and betrayed while her daughter looks on with increasing dismay." which changes as Ruthie who narrates the story observes Rita making the same mistakes again and again.

these two have lent their names and heartache to a couple of films. (The movie shares its title with a Jimmy Buffett song.) They���re back in shadow form in ���Frank & Lola ��� this time with an unpersuasively paired Michael Shannon and Imogen Poots as Las Vegas souls who after tumbling into bed fall for each other. Soon Frank and Lola learn that love still hurts especially when tendrils of jealously start twisting through the story and he confuses abandon with possession." but he hasn���t given Frank enough of an inner life to make the character���s transformation from a besotted lover into a distrustful one plausible. Instead Frank stares at Lola broods occasionally explodes but all too often registers as an uninteresting jerk. Lola meanwhile weeps and explains and rapidly fades. Paradoxically one of the strongest scenes happens early when a newly acquainted Frank and Lola explore each other���s bodies as the jeweled Vegas skyline glows behind them. They fumble sexily and it works." even if the two leads never make sense together. Still that is the way their characters were written and so Frank (Mr. Shannon) fixes his sights on Lola (Ms. Poots) and doesn���t let go. A chef he wines and dines her and even meets her mother (a funny Rosanna Arquette livening up the table). There are bumps including those created by Frank who switches into bad-boyfriend mode when he sees Lola talking with a stranger (Justin Long). He not only spies on Lola he also pulls a Joe Pesci on her asking ���Who was the mook?��� Then Lola sleeps with someone else which she blames on a past trauma." making his feature debut succeeds best when he���s digging little tunnels away from his unhappy couple. He has an eye for locations and can thicken the atmosphere nicely particularly when he leaves things unsaid. The Paris scenes involving Frank���s audition for a fancy chef���s job are unusual enough to be intriguing convincing enough to draw you in. You believe the kitchen even when you don���t necessarily buy the knife skills. But when Frank begins stalking a man (Michael Nyqvist) from Lola���s past the movie soon wildly overheats with a waving blade grappling bodies popping eyes and sinister French people who seem to have slunk in from another movie." partly because the writer-director Matthew Ross doesn���t have a full handle on it or his actors. Mr. Shannon is an imposing screen presence and it���s easy for him to dominate his scenes which happens too often here. It���s tough to see him and Ms. Poots as anything other than a match made in casting especially as complications and feelings pile up. When Frank expresses his hurt he doesn���t seem just wounded; he also comes off as a menace. And while Lola may like it like that the appealing Ms. Poots never persuades you. Only when Emmanuelle Devos shows up in a Paris detour does Mr. Shannon find some ballast."

It is also of course what actors do all the time but almost never with Ms. Huppert���s combination of unbridled instinct and absolute control. Nathalie reinvents herself before our eyes and we believe what we see because Ms. Huppert is doing it too." and the future she imagines is in some measure her own. Middle age is a landscape that is especially difficult for young people to picture and one that they often ignore. It looks so sad so boring so scary and the people who live there tend to be so weird and self-conscious. Ms. Hansen-Love surveys the territory with clear eyes but also with an unmistakable shading of pity and with ideas in particular about Nathalie���s sexuality and the political compromises of her generation that seem more like assumptions than insights." it���s because of Ms. Huppert whose best performances often feel like dialogues ��� or outright arguments ��� with her directors. In a recent article in The New Republic the critic Miriam Bale has described the way Ms. Huppert in Paul Verhoeven���s ���Elle��� ��� a film about a Parisian woman of a certain age that is as lurid and aggressive as this one is calm and thoughtful ��� assumes control over the character and her story. ���Her performance is a clear case of actress as auteur ��� Ms. Bale writes an observation that strikes me as at least partly true in the case of ���Things to Come.���" with English subtitles.

Nathalie loses her mother (�_dith Scob) and her husband Heinz (Andr�� Marcon) a fellow philosopher who has fallen in love with someone else. There are troubles on the professional front as well including some awful meetings with the dynamic and innovative crew of young cretins who seem to have taken over the operations of Nathalie���s longtime publisher." with its echo of Aristotle might be of interest to Nathalie Ms. Huppert���s character in ���Things to Come ��� Mia Hansen-Love���s new movie. Nathalie is a philosophy professor and the script bristles with casual allusions to famous and obscure philosophers. (Plot points include a misplaced copy of Schopenhauer and a learned text on Max Horkheimer.) She may not have everything figured out ��� a true intellectual she is too circumspect for certainty ��� but it seems safe to say that she has arrived at midlife with a measure of wisdom and a solid foundation of comfort." and Nathalie is too stoical too analytical and too much of an ironist to engage in self-pity. She has mostly warm relationships with her grown children ��� and a new grandchild in the picture ��� and an intriguing unsettling friendship with a talented former student named Fabien (Roman Kolinka). The possibility of romance hovers in the air between them like a theoretical construct trying to break into reality." like a husband���s suicide (in ���Father of My Children���) or a painful breakup (in ���Goodbye First Love���). But she is temperamentally allergic to melodrama and far less interested in the easy shocks and tidy consolations of plot than in the meandering almost random texture of lived experience. The French title of ���Things to Come��� (it���s also the name of an old British science-fiction movie) is ���L���Avenir ��� which more literally means ���the future��� and which more accurately conveys the film���s open-ended exploratory structure." if you need distraction from all the other arguments going on right now. Isabelle Huppert: great actress or world���s greatest actress? Once that is settled (in favor of the second option of course) we can turn to more advanced Huppertiana.

The intensity of the resistance to the idea of black citizenship ��� the terror and violence that white authorities unleashed against it ��� shocked many whites and helped make civil rights a national cause. The simultaneous rediscovery of an African-American musical form that had suffered neglect and condescension had a similar effect and artistic innovators like Skip James and Son House belatedly received the recognition (and at least some of the money) that had long been their due." many of whom risked comfort and safety in the cause of black equality.

Like many blues lyrics this one is open to endless interpretation but in the context of this movie ��� the past it evokes and the moment at which it arrives ��� it sounds like both an affirmation and a warning. Human history may bend toward the light but it also passes through long periods of darkness. Hard-won rights can be taken away. Progress can be rolled back. Long-forgotten songs can be remembered but the opposite can also happen. This captivating movie like the blues itself is at once a recognition of those somber truths and a gesture of protest against them." Mr. Pollard explores how idealism horrific brutality and artistic genius converged in a single historical moment. Interviews with survivors eyewitnesses scholars and musicians are complemented with archival material animation (which is fast becoming a staple of modern documentary filmmaking) and the retrospective thoughts of critics journalists and musicians. Some of these are a little distracting. It���s nice to hear Lucinda Williams Gary Clark Jr. and others testify to (and demonstrate) the enduring influence of James and House but it���s infinitely more valuable to hear the men themselves." ��� Sam Pollard���s compact resonant documentary ��� part essay film part road picture part musical anthology ��� is built around an astonishing historical coincidence. On June 21 1964 two lost giants of the Delta blues Skip James and Son House were found by separate crews of obsessed music fans after weeks of amateur sleuthing along the back roads of Mississippi.

There���s the dancing Jackie the clapping Jackie. Jackie the mother Jackie the wife. There���s also the steely Jackie who insists on an elaborate public funeral procession with bagpipes and visiting witnesses to her bereavement. To help put across these Jackies Mr. Larra�_n reconstructs some historical images of Mrs. Kennedy and at times blends in these re-creations with original footage." bloody gun violence. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes." it takes her personhood for granted which may be why Mr. Larra�_n shows all the snot tears and blood all the desperate bodily mess. In ���Jackie ��� Kennedy���s body ��� the object of obsessive inquiries ��� is replaced by hers in a kind of symbolic transfiguration as she assumes the role of his dignified representative the guardian of a shining legacy. The assassination was a national and personal tragedy one which she answered with a myth which was an act of radical will and sovereignty. She married John F. Kennedy; she also helped invent him." flashing his big teeth (he���s played by an uncanny look-alike Caspar Phillipson) but as the film���s title announces it���s all about her. Jackie (Natalie Portman perfect) first appears at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port Mass.

If its large windows suggest transparency her tight face and coiled body relay that she has other plans for the unnamed journalist (Billy Crudup) who���s come to write about how she feels and what it means. In some roles Ms. Portman stiffens up and never seems to get out of her head; in ���Jackie��� this works as a character trait." scrutiny that in turn emphasizes just how much of a performance each really is. Repeatedly Mr. Larra�_n shows Jackie looking in mirrors and through windows a strategy that doubles her image and underscores her multiple roles. Some of the burdens of such performances are less explored than inferred as when she startlingly compares Jack to Jesus with a reference to temptations and the desert. In this telling at least her restoration of the White House becomes a preview of the gut renovation of the Kennedy legacy that she initiates a redesign that also positions Jack as a latter-day Lincoln." unsympathetic fictional gloss on the writer Theodore H. White. On Nov. 29 1963 one week after cradling her dying husband���s head in her lap Mrs. Kennedy gave an interview to White that he said lasted about four hours. Originally titled ���For President Kennedy: An Epilogue ��� White���s article  ran in Life magazine and was an exemplar of impressively marketable mythmaking ��� it inaugurated the Camelot fairy tale. White knew Kennedy having written ���The Making of the President 1960 ��� an account of his presidential campaign. But the Widow was another matter entirely and in his interview notes White scrawled the words ���What does a woman think?���" the film has a bookend structure with opening scenes echoing those at the conclusion. It���s a familiar design one that briefly gives the film a ���once upon a time��� flavor as Jackie tells her story moving often briskly among the present near past and distant past. Fragmented narratives with hopscotching time aren���t uncommon even if they often come across as efforts to jazz up a dull story. In this case these shifts help blur time ��� the past remains horrifyingly present ��� and underline the magnitude of her trauma. And while some of the flashbacks are suitably glamorous others expose the raw horror that Jackie���s veil conceals and announces." teleporting Jackie for instance onto Air Force One where ��� with her back to the camera ��� she primps in a mirror while practicing an apparent speech in Spanish for the imminent Dallas trip. Dressed in her pink Chanel suit she puts on her pillbox hat as if ready for her entrance. The suit���s bright color gives the film a visual jolt much like the deep-red roses that someone places in Jackie���s arms after she and Jack deplane. Some of the most famous photos from that day like those of Lyndon B. Johnson being sworn in on Air Force One are in black and white so it���s easy to miss that the smudges that later appeared on the pink suit were splatters of blood." the film ���Jackie��� is a reminder that for a time she was bigger than any star bigger than Marilyn or Liz. She was the Widow ��� an embodiment of grief symbol of strength tower of dignity and crucially architect of brilliant political theater. Hers was also a spectacularly reproducible image. It���s no wonder that shortly after President John F. Kennedy died Andy Warhol started on more than 300 portraits of the Widow juxtaposing photographs of her taken before and after the assassination. She smiles in a few in others she looks frozen (or is it stoic?); the ones that pop are tight close-ups. They look like frames for an unfinished motion picture." but with a shift in emphasis asking instead: ���What does this specific human being think?��� The Chilean director Pablo Larra�_n making his first English-language feature takes this query and his title subject seriously but without deadening self-importance. The film has the requisite surface fidelity the meticulous re-creations period trim and historical figures sympathetically played by the likes of Peter Sarsgaard and a bouffanted Greta Gerwig. But it also has moments of lightness and strangeness as well as kinks and sour notes which strengthen the sense that these are people not figurines in a dutiful paint-by-numbers biopic." the film mostly avoids presidential politics and policies as well as the grim scandals sex parties and popped pills. Instead it explores the fantasy that becomes that scandalous house���s own double: Camelot as Mrs. Kennedy christened it. The idea of the Kennedy years as Camelot became an enduring trope and for some a maddening lie. In a 2011 essay in Vanity Fair Christopher Hitchens took a whack at Jacqueline Kennedy arguing that her ���winsome innocence ��� as he put it was ���a soft cover for a specific sort of knowingness and calculation.��� This knowingness seemed to repulse him; it galvanizes ���Jackie.���" 1963 three days after becoming the world���s most famous widow Jacqueline Kennedy slipped on a mourning veil. A diaphanous shroud reaching to her waist it moved lightly as she walked behind her husband���s coffin in the cortege that traveled from the White House to St. Matthew���s Cathedral. The veil was transparent enough to reveal her pale face though not entirely ensuring that she was at once visible and obscured. ���I don���t like to hear people say that I am poised and maintaining a good appearance ��� she later said. ���I am not a movie actress.���"

Not well enough to redeem the movie however." Pyotr Fyodorov sometimes resembles a young sleek Colin Farrell. Mr. Fyodorov���s stolid bearing serves him reasonably well as his character���s back story has him enduring extreme pain in the manner of ���The Revenant��� or a ���90s Mel Gibson movie. ���You lived among the Aleuts ��� one character observes of the sharpshooter. ���They know no mercy.���"

Death by Audio was a quasi-communal art music and small-scale-manufacturing space that was forced to close after its building was taken over by the ostensibly renegade media company Vice. The movie is not boring as such but because it is a chronicle told almost entirely by the people behind the space (Mr. Conboy being one of them) it is relentlessly personal ��� there���s no genuine cultural critique. For all the talk from the founders about creativity and newness nobody seems to notice that the artists occupying the space were for the most part coloring in the lines of thoroughly codified forms. The musician Dan Deacon says ���I���m worried about anarchist temples for expression and community being eliminated from our lifestyle.��� The final phrase there nails a particular perspective on cultural production." like talks about how much better things were ���in their day ��Ȋ�� Matt Conboy this movie���s director and one of its subjects says in a bluff tone while driving around Williamsburg Brooklyn. Such talk and such people Mr. Conboy says are ���really boring.���" ��� the opening title card reads in homage to Martin Scorsese���s concert movie ���The Last Waltz.��� But the good music here from bands like Deerhoof and Protomartyr is heard in frustratingly short snippets.

For another whereas ���Casablanca��� put forth a spine-stiffening anti-fascist call to arms ���Allied��� offers the comforts of elegant escapism. Its moral complexities and political ambiguities are intriguing rather than troubling its ethical and emotional agonies a diversion from rather than a reflection of our own." bureaucratic entanglement and everyday pleasures ��� is evoked in fine detail. Mr. Zemeckis and the screenwriter Steven Knight plant almost imperceptible clues that blossom into sinister and scary possibilities in a way that is both shocking and satisfying. You have an itchy premonition that something terrible is going to happen and when it does the itch is scratched." Max is introduced to Marianne Beaus��jour a French resistance fighter who is his partner on a dangerous mission. Their orders are to pretend that they are married and they end up giving themselves wholeheartedly to the performance and to each other. Marianne explains that part of her method is to make sure that whatever the details of the imposture the feeling is real. That assertion will haunt the second half of the movie which follows the couple to London." ��� a plausible portrait of a midcentury marriage that is also a fantastical piece of trompe-l���oeil storytelling. Ms. Cotillard in a remarkable series of frocks hats coats and trouser suits is the key to the film���s spell. Is Marianne a stylized studio-era feminine ideal or a film noir femme fatale ��� or something else entirely a modern woman decked out in Hollywood hand-me-downs?" among other things a marvel of structure a perfectly bifurcated story that manages a drastic shift in tone with exquisite aplomb. Max and Marianne set up house in Hampstead; she gives birth to a daughter during an air raid; he commutes to a mostly deskbound job and the audience is free to appreciate the work of a superb supporting cast that includes Jared Harris Lizzy Caplan and Simon McBurney." of course. Mr. Pitt playing a Canadian wing commander in the Royal Air Force has apparently drawn inspiration from the trees in the great forests of the North. He is handsome trim and efficient but the same might be said of a wooden canoe and his character���s stoical reserve often feels more like an empty space than a deep pool of untapped feeling. This changes toward the end but the final minutes of ���Allied��� also provide some grounds for complaint. They are puffy and sentimental the cinematic equivalent of a cloying dessert following an otherwise well-prepared meal." ��� Robert Zemeckis���s deft and diverting World War II romantic thriller operates a bit like ���Casablanca��� in reverse." and supplement it with a different comparison: ���Allied ��� while neither haute cuisine or haute couture is like an expertly tailored suit or a properly cooked classic dish. It���s not so much a work of art as a triumph of craft and therefore a reminder of the deep pleasures of old-fashioned technique and long experience." played by Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard much in the way that Paris does for Ilsa and Rick. It���s the scene of their first bliss the place they���ll always have when things get complicated elsewhere." more dazzling films ��� as a dogmatic anti-Gumpian my list of favorites would include ���Back to the Future ��� ���Who Framed Roger Rabbit��� and ���Cast Away��� ��� but this one may be the purest and most relaxed demonstration of his mastery." ��� it infuses a venerable genre and a familiar period with new interest. The first shot of Mr. Pitt���s character Max Vatan parachuting into the Moroccan desert is hypnotically beautiful and strange. Your eye keeps recalibrating the perspective anticipating Max���s touchdown when he is still far above the ground and then blinking in surprise when he finally lands. The rest of the film produces a similar effect teasing your expectations and concealing cards in its impeccable sleeves." sex and smoking going on in this establishment. Running time: 1 hour 56 minutes." the sexuality too frank the politics too cloudy. But you might nonetheless feel like an older kind of moviegoer while you���re watching it: an adult for one thing whose intelligence is respected by an intricate thematically thorny plot even as your thirst for visceral excitement is slaked by clean and breathless action sequences. You also get to look at beautiful people in (and half out of) beautiful clothes. The fundamental things apply."

���Bulworth ��� Mr. Beatty reinvented himself as a truth-spouting politician disseminating his liberal message in the language of rap: a vocabulary that as wielded by Mr. Beatty rang as simultaneously ridiculous and pointedly articulate. And in the smart hugely entertaining ���Rules Don���t Apply ��� Mr. Beatty expands his absurdist vision of politics and show business to take in Hollywood where he has reigned as an enigmatic glamour boy turned statesman with serious talent for nearly 60 years." 79 arriving at a moment when he may realize that he has little left to protect and is free to portray the hypercompetitive Hollywood game as a nonsensical joke." secrecy and beautiful women are qualities reflected in Mr. Beatty���s past behavior. Probably no one in Hollywood is the repository of so much gossip. Does anyone else know more about how the intersection of show business power brokers and politicians actually operates? How could someone with so much knowledge gleaned over decades not come to regard the circus with an amused cynicism? Mr. Beatty���s Hughes has his moments of monstrous egotism but conveys a sly self-awareness even when Hughes���s battiest behavior leaves those around him visibly cringing." everything seems intentional. He has always been a stickler for details right down to the new film���s witty opening disclaimer: ���Never check an interesting fact ��� a quotation ascribed to Hughes." brief strong language and drug references. Running time: 2 hours 6 minutes." peering anxiously from behind a curtain he is already in the throes of paranoia and a worsening obsessive-compulsive disorder. He repeats the same phrase over and over secretly records his conversations and in the funniest bit demands a huge delivery of his favorite ice cream banana-nut then forgets about it." Nadine and Matthew Broderick playing Hughes���s chief driver and Frank���s boss Levar Mathis as a flunky who when not rolling his eyes wears a glazed deer-in-the-headlights expression." the same melancholy theme heard in Luchino Visconti���s ���Death in Venice.��� Though wildly overused in ���Rules Don���t Apply ��� the Adagietto feels like an aging Hollywood monarch���s nostalgic lament for a place that no longer exists." an aspiring starlet under contract to Hughes and her strict Baptist mother Lucy (Annette Bening). The mouthy and aggressive Marla expects to be screen-tested but to her frustration finds herself one of 26 young women in a pool of impatient hopefuls all waiting for a turn." Frank Forbes (Alden Ehrenreich from ���Hail Caesar!���) and their attraction is instantaneous. Mr. Beatty is old enough to remember the suffocating puritanical atmosphere of the ���50s and this movie���s portrayal of bygone courtship rituals is dryly comedic. Marla refers to herself as ���the virgin Baptist.��� A comic high point of the movie is a messy sexual accident played for farce." which Mr. Beatty wrote and directed from a story he wrote with Bo Goldman is that it is so good-humored. Fools and idiots abound but demonic systemic evil does not. Mr. Beatty obviously loves Hollywood which has been good to him. The movie���s shots of Los Angeles thoroughfares in the ���50s and ���60s exert a nostalgic tug. That the actress playing Marla Lily Collins is a virtual look-alike of the teenage Elizabeth Taylor is no accident." then in his late 50s was growing increasingly eccentric." ���Rules Don���t Apply ��� as a screwball ���Citizen Kane.��� But that���s what it feels like. From another perspective this serio-comic portrait of Hughes the aeronautics mogul movie producer and marathon womanizer might also be a satirical cartoon that emphasizes his similarities to Donald J. Trump. Why else would Mr. Beatty name a fictional aspiring singer and actress who comes into Hughes���s orbit Marla Mabrey?" the ordinary rules of human behavior can be flouted? It���s almost a law of celebrity that given such stimulation egos tend to inflate to gargantuan size. Hollywood teems with pompous self-appointed kings ruling their fiefs as they see fit."

into which the filmmakers insert a handful of visual and musical showstoppers. The best of these is probably a glam-rock pastiche called ���Shiny ��� performed by Jemaine Clement in the guise of a greedy giant crab. Mr. Miranda���s motor-mouthed synthesis of hip-hop and show-tune traditions provides jolts of energy and wit matched by some clever bits of animation. Maui���s tattoos come to life making his body an inky comic strip within the film���s splashy colorful cartoon world." she must overcome her own doubts (and Maui���s skepticism) and prove herself through a series of ordeals. Unlike ���Frozen ��� which spiked the formula with genuine surprise ���Moana��� unfolds more or less as expected. Which is just fine really. Archetypes are there for a reason: to provide reassurance and encouragement amid the squall and uncertainty of life." the in-house influence of Pixar has reinvigorated the animation (though some of us may still pine for the classic painterly Disney visual aesthetic) and the rejuvenation of American musical theater has provided a fresh pool of songwriting talent. ���Moana ��� directed by Ron Clements and John Musker from a screenplay by Jared Bush includes a few infectious numbers by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a heart-tugging orchestral pop score by the Disney stalwart Mark Mancina. Buoyant songs by the Polynesian singer and composer Opetaia Foa���i (performed with his band Te Vaka) anchor the film���s cheery globalism in a specific South Pacific milieu." as these things go a pretty good brand. The Disney princess tradition has held onto its charm as it has changed with the times widening its cultural frame of reference and allowing its heroines to travel down paths other than the one leading straight to matrimony. Moana bantering with Maui (Dwayne Johnson) like a rival sibling and borne on her journey by the spirits of the ocean and her grandmother (Rachel House) has no need of a prince." a m��lange of updated folklore contemporary eco-spiritualism and tried-and-true Disney-Pixar formula. Heihei who beats out an adorable pig for the job of cute animal sidekick on the voyage itself is a lot like Becky the addled loon in ���Finding Dory.��� And the first part of the story in which Moana���s anxious protective father tries to keep his daughter from venturing beyond the reef that encircles their island is a ringing echo of ���Finding Nemo.���" as usual you succumb to an enjoyable experience that splits the difference between mythology and merchandising. Moana is an inspiring heroine a smart brave and decent young woman whose individual aspirations align perfectly with a larger world-saving mission. She is also an exuberant and appealing self-marketer whose likeness will proliferate on school bags and under Christmas trees for a long time to come." a little scary. Running time: 1 hour 43 minutes." but she���s furious when Maui a tattooed muscle-bound demigod calls her a princess. Moana (MWAH-nah) is not only part of a dynastic line but also a girl off on an adventure in the company of a cute animal sidekick (a dimwitted chicken named Heihei). So not just any princess in other words: a Disney princess. She may be on a quest to save her island and restore ecological balance to the planet but Moana (voiced by Auli���i Cravalho) is also upholding a brand."

(Shots of the city may be entirely stock footage as if the movie crew knew tagging along might be a bad idea.)" between wax works of W. C.

Only Mr. Thornton could have played the role." ���Bad Santa 2 ��� directed by Mark Waters (already a connoisseur of bad behavior from ���Mean Girls���) whose pitch meeting seems to have proceeded from two unnecessary questions: What if bad Santa weren���t as bad as all that? And what if he had an estranged mother whose conduct is at least as foul as his?" it���s the spectacle of Kathy Bates as Willie���s mom whom Willie resents. (He offhandedly mentions having taken the fall for her at age 11.) Her remarks about her careless parenting (���Hell I didn���t even know I���d given birth until I���d tripped over him���) constitute the movie���s best effort at a running joke and while Ms. Bates can be a nimble scene stealer decking her out in tattoos and punk jewelry is not enough to spark an uninspired script." who pockets most of the revenue.

Running time: 1 hour 57 minutes." generally likable mook ��� a bit of a bad boy but over all an emblem of the integrity of the working-class athlete. After the accident the portrayal deepens and delivers substantial emotional dividends without yielding to facile sentimentality. As his trainer Mr. Eckhart is similarly committed. Mr. Younger���s direction is focused and sometimes disarming ��� scenes that at first seem like slice-of-life digressions such as a postaccident surprise birthday party for the protagonist lead to unexpected mini-epiphanies." the Pazmanian Devil as Mr. Pazienza is known begins working with a hard-drinking trainer Kevin Rooney (Aaron Eckhart) also washed up by conventional wisdom. The two defy expectations handily taking a title belt two weight classes above which the boxer had previously fought. All���s well that ends well ��� except the movie is not even halfway over." Mr. Younger Mr. Teller and the rest of the cast make ���Bleed for This��� more than an inspiring version of Mr. Pazienza���s story; they make it a genuinely interesting one." ���Bleed for This ��� the ���based on a true story��� boxing picture directed by Ben Younger and starring Miles Teller follows the sports-movie-comeback-narrative playbook with extreme fidelity. It would be tiresome were it not for the casual energy of the filmmaking. Mr. Teller plays Vinny Pazienza the Rhode Island-born-and-bred boxer who as the film opens in 1988 seems a bit feckless. Staying up too late in Las Vegas the night before a big fight he goes on to lose that match. His third in a row. His own manager announces in a televised interview that the fighter should hang up the towel." ���Bleed for This ��� which Mr. Younger wrote from a story credited to Pippa Bianco and Angelo Pizzo plays with the factual record a bit. For one the film makes it look as if his first fight with Mr. Dur��n was his first after recovering from his injury which required him to wear a metal halo ring and neck brace for six months. (Among the delightful features of the halo are the four screws that go directly into the patient���s skull.) That time line is off but the change certainly heightens the drama. (Earlier this year the far inferior boxing movie ���Hands of Stone��� told Mr. Dur��n���s story but it did not include his encounters with Mr. Pazienza.)" Mr. Younger���s affectionate depiction of close-knit Italian-American life in Rhode Island is not surprising but his devotion to the conscientious portrayal of the fundamentals of the so-called sweet science is refreshing. This is a boxing movie that actually gets boxing." the movie���s title is the most unfortunate element of the enterprise: It is not only a little off-putting but it���s also inaccurate particularly in its masochistic implications. The movie makes it clear that Mr. Pazienza doesn���t box to suffer he suffers to box: The story is about moving past the pain even the excruciating pain the fiercely anti-drink-and-drugs boxer endures when he insists on having his halo brace removed without anesthesia." and he���s in danger of never walking again. Given that Mr. Pazienza went on to among other things fight and beat Roberto Dur��n twice after his recovery the comeback narrative certainly gains in dimension here."

Before long he his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter India (Ellie Bamber) are driving in the pitch-black West Texas evening seemingly alone on a two-lane highway.

Susan is so upset that she stops reading shifting the point of view back to her." ���Nocturnal Animals��� resembles a hall of mirrors one doomed to shatter. There are moments of low-key pleasure in this fun house especially in the scenes of Susan���s world an absurd at times amusing cartoon filled with lavish excesses baroque shocks (a Damien Hirst outrage) and exotic creatures (Jena Malone Michael Sheen Andrea Riseborough) who are as unreal as aliens or the boldfaced names in a Vogue layout. Mr. Ford seems entirely at ease in this world which has all the life of a beautifully appointed sarcophagus and suggests that part of Susan died long ago. Edward���s novel shocks her back to life only to destroy her." ���Nocturnal Animals��� is about art ��� its creation reception and power. Art and power are something that Susan (Amy Adams) who runs a Los Angeles art gallery understands. They���ve given her cultural capital and money (there���s a Jeff Koons statue next to her pool) yet she isn���t an artist. That distinction belongs to her ex-husband Edward a writer who soon after the movie opens sends Susan his latest ���Nocturnal Animals ��� a novel that he���s dedicated to her.

Here an unhappy girlfriend becomes a happy wife a betrayed man becomes a victim all over again and assorted murderers take turns bringing the pain." of course ��� it turns readers into casting directors (and production designers) which is why fans can become irate when a screen adaptation doesn���t look like the book that played in their heads. Susan has effectively cast her former husband as the star of his brutal novel and personalized the story even further with some other choices. Tony���s wife looks like Susan; his daughter resembles her daughter (India Menuez). Other touches bind the stories even tighter including camera angles and body positions the crosses that Susan and Laura each wear and several flashes of bright green that connect the villain in one story to the villain in the other." ��� including Mr. Ford���s ambition but too often it feels like the work of an observant student. He���s adept at creating different realisms and textures for each story line variations that add layers of meaning. Susan���s world for instance comes across as far more artificial than Tony���s does with its cruelties dust and blood. She looks as if she stepped out of a Pedro Almod�_var fantasia while Tony ends up clawing through a Jim Thompson pulp novel (one featuring a great Michael Shannon). That���s a tough combination to pull off especially without the critical distance deep feeling and laughter that turn an ordinary melodrama into an Almod�_var." ��� the director Tom Ford (���A Single Man���) handles the transitions between Susan���s story and Tony���s smoothly. (His editor is Joan Sobel.) Some of the shifts are fairly blunt as Mr. Ford abruptly cuts back and forth between the two stories.

There���s pathos in Newt���s mission to save these furred and feathered beings an honorable calling that serves as a bewitched if overly tidy and cute vision of our own better natures. Yet there���s something fundamentally generic about Newt with his flapping feet and innocuous eccentricities. The beasts give him a reason for being ��� while the story���s turns give him a nice workout ��� but he doesn���t come across as meaningfully burdened; mostly he engages in slapstick nonsense and goes doe-eyed at an ally (Katherine Waterston)." the title critters in ���Fantastic Beasts��� are whimsically entertaining and occasionally as entrancing as those animals both real and imagined crawling through a medieval illuminated manuscript with their gaudy hues and hints of gold. Newt is a British magizoologist a collector-protector of exotic animals and is en route home from his travels scooping up specimens. He���s the custodian of one beast that resembles a giant eagle (with a dash of a risen phoenix) and a purplish snake that looks as if it started out as a peacock before changing its mind during incubation which is how a pair of wings ended up fluttering near its coiling tail."

Virginia passed its first anti-miscegenation law in 1691 partly to prevent what it called ���spurious issue ��� or what most people just call children." which apparently changed over the years.

���Peter and the Farm ��� is a man who contains multitudes. With his snowy beard and imperious bearing Peter Dunning at his most eloquent conveys the authority of a biblical prophet but without a religious platform. As he surveys the 187-acre farm he has tended for more than 35 years he also suggests a latter-day Prospero ruefully aware that his powers are waning." he says with a mixture of bitterness and pride has cost him ���four children two wives and an inheritance.��� None of those figures are heard or seen here except briefly in photographs. At a low moment during the filming which took place over a year he suggests that Mr. Stone document his suicide." but misses and has to do it again. The film goes on to show the entire process of skinning and eviscerating the animal. It doesn���t shy away from documenting the repositioning of a calf stuck inside a cow giving birth. Mr. Dunning even displays sympathy for coyotes that have decimated his sheep herd." Mr. Dunning is ���a man in full ��� by turns majestic and cantankerous and unafraid to look into the void and to ask the deepest most personal questions about the purpose of life. As the camera surveys the glorious landscape of rural Vermont with the same dispassion that it focuses on a cow defecating the film evokes the natural world with a grand poetic awareness of the primal connectedness of things. From the rapturous to the gross you can���t have one without the other." he was adopted by a family who he believes never gave him the full story of his parentage. He recalls his days as a free-spirited Marine stationed in Hawaii. In college he majored in painting and minored in sculpture and he still draws and writes poetry. He was attracted to farming in the early 1970s during the counterculture���s back-to-the-land movement. He was 33 when he bought the farm in 1978. He describes a sawmill accident in which he nearly severed one hand and endured ���nine or 10��� operations to restore its functionality." with minor interruptions by barely glimpsed part-time farmhands and the film crew hovering on the sidelines. A self-described alcoholic he is subject to bouts of severe depression and suicidal despair and at one point he describes waking up in the middle of the night and guzzling alcohol to forestall the DTs. But his binges are interspersed with periods of abstinence." when members of his immediate family left the property on which he raises organic livestock fruit and vegetables. Mr. Dunning���s love of the land and his sheep cows and pigs are palpable in scenes of him toiling in the fields and barns and herding his animals. And his poignant declaration ���I care more about the farm than me��� rings true."

The film recounts the band���s ascent and then its implosion in 1997 around a planned publicity push into the United States. (Tension arose from Toshi���s involvement in what Yoshiki on camera calls a cult.) Four months after the breakup Hide (pronounced HEE-deh) the original lead guitarist was found dead in his Tokyo apartment apparently by his own hand.

Young Desmond (Darcy Bryce) and his brother Hal (Roman Guerriero) chase each other over rocks and streams. Not that they dwell in a perfect Eden. There is a whiff of Cain and Abel in their relationship and more serious trouble from their father Tom (Hugo Weaving) a bitter alcoholic World War I veteran. Though he hates war the elder Doss is hardly a pacifist and his violent behavior toward his sons and their mother (Rachel Griffiths) helps push Desmond toward peace-loving piety." but it is also true to its genre a rousing celebration of the thrills of battle.

born James Newell Osterberg Jr. recalls growing up in a trailer home outside of Ann Arbor Mich. with amazingly supportive parents. It was Soupy Sales an early television idol who instructed his audience to limit their letters to 25 words or less and it���s advice that Iggy Pop took to heart when he began writing songs. While working in a record store he discovered the avant-garde music of Harry Partch and other experimental composers. When he was briefly managed by Tony DeFries David Bowie���s manager he turned down the opportunity to star on Broadway in ���Peter Pan.���" as the protopunk rebel who spawned a lineage that includes the Sex Pistols the Ramones and those who came after." ��� he says his eyes blazing ���I���ve been out to get ���em.���" images of Iggy Pop over 60 and performing shirtless reveal that there is no forestalling the ravages of time. At a certain point the flesh starts hanging off the bone no matter how skeletal the frame." as a teenager contemptuous frat boys rocked the family trailer back and forth." he comes across as a smart articulate chronicler of his own history and a musician fully aware of his influences and proud of his place in the annals of rock. Other members of the Stooges are interviewed separately and offer little of interest. The most informative is James Williamson who left the band in the early 1980s and became a successful electronics engineer. He returned after the death of the guitarist Ron Asheton in 2009." 69 who tells his story in a deep almost feral growl. Occasionally his face lights up with a demonic grin and you glimpse the soul of a proudly unrepentant wild man who even more than Frank Sinatra did it ���his way��� and lived to tell the tale." ���Gimme Danger ��� Jim Jarmusch���s reverent documentary portrait of Iggy Pop one of rock���s ultimate daredevil provocateurs is downright prim. There are casual confessions of self-destructive out-of-control behavior by Iggy Pop and his band the Stooges. But you don���t see it. You only hear about it and it���s glossed over as yesterday���s bad-boy antics." Iggy Pop is a live wire. Cadaverous and sinewy with dyed blond hair burning blue eyes and a chiseled torso he is an extraordinary specimen. His look he says was partly inspired by Hollywood pharaohs like Yul Brynner in ���The Ten Commandments.���" who calls the Stooges ���the greatest rock ���n��� roll band ever ��� worried that hair-raising tales of past excesses would undermine this exercise in canonization. ���Gimme Danger��� also inexplicably leaves out Iggy Pop���s solo career when he released the great albums ���The Idiot��� and ���Lust for Life.��� That said ���Gimme Danger��� is still plenty entertaining and includes many moments of foaming-at-the-mouth musical fury." rampant sexual behavior or fights among bandmates. Iggy Pop is not shown vomiting onstage or rolling around on broken glass both of which he was known to do. Not a groupie is to be seen.

a professor at the University of Cambridge. They met (where else?) at the edge of a volcano when Mr. Herzog was shooting ���Encounters at the End of the World ��� his 2008 documentary about the Antarctic its splendors secrets and visitors (like Mr. Oppenheimer). ���Inferno��� is a deeper plunge into some old preoccupations as Mr. Herzog suggests by folding in scenes from that earlier movie as well as from another of his films ���La Soufri��re ��� Waiting for an Inevitable Disaster��� (1977) about a volcano on the verge of eruption. ���Waiting for an Inevitable Disaster ��� of course could be the subtitle of many of his movies." ���Into the Inferno ��� Mr. Herzog takes you straight to the edge of the abyss. In quotidian terms it is a documentary about volcanoes. In Herzogian terms it is a metaphysical exploration of the wonders and terrors of nature as well as the fragility and comedy of human life complete with beautiful cinema-tography haunting music a church that looks like a chicken and a Communist attraction that resembles a Bethlehem manger. Written and directed by Mr. Herzog it vaults across the globe ��� from the South Pacific to Indonesia Ethiopia Iceland and North Korea ��� as he peers into volcanoes confers with experts and tries to understand what draws people to the fire." filled with strange stories fascinating rituals and ethereally beautiful images of bubbling magma and flowing lava some of which were captured using drones. (The director of photography is Peter Zeitlinger.) By far the weirdest stop though delivers you right into North Korea where national lore has it that the country���s founder Kim Il-sung first led the fight for independence at the foot of Mount Paektu living in a log cabin where armies of civilians now come to worship. It would be easy to laugh at this spectacle with its beloved leaders and mad smilers if the whole thing were not so heart-rending and tragic and if Mr. Herzog���s gruff humanism didn���t bring you to tears." more worthy of exploration and veneration. For decades he has been probing the limits of existence charting its mysteries and madness in fiction and nonfiction movies that together have created an extraordinary body of work. Part cinematic magus part cosmic philosopher he takes you places you never knew you wanted to go asks questions you never considered and introduces you to characters who suggest the worst and the very best about us. There���s a strain of melancholia in this searching. I���m not sure if Mr. Herzog thinks that we can be saved ��� or are worth saving ��� but his restlessness suggests perhaps." something to hold onto as the movie jumps from one location ��� and one scientific and philosophic theme ��� to the next. After its interlude in Vanuatu where inhabitants speak of spirits in the volcanoes it shifts to Indonesia where farmers plant near a belching Mount Sinabung. From there the movie travels to the hellishly hot eerily stunning Afar Triangle in Ethiopia where anthropologists are unearthing human bones tens of thousands of years old. Then it���s off to Iceland where Mr. Oppenheimer surveys the voluptuous otherworldly landscape and Mr. Herzog reads aloud from the Codex Regius a medieval manuscript." the probing questions and the occasional glint of characteristic deadpan comedy but he also relies on Mr. Oppenheimer as an on-camera interpreter. Mr. Oppenheimer is a charming interlocutor and with his easy manner and slightly elfin face he soon becomes an emblem for scientific inquiry at its most accessible and exciting. He grounds the movie in science but he also helps give it a conversational lightness as he stands and delivers on say molten rock and Mr. Herzog ponders creation. It���s a winning sneakily warming division of labor partly because this is also a documentary about friendship." ���Into the Inferno��� is surprisingly buoyant partly because of Mr. Oppenheimer who���s credited as a collaborator. The movie was inspired by Mr. Oppenheimer���s 2011 book ���Eruptions That Shook the World ��� an inquiry into the impact of worldwide volcanic activity. From fire and brimstone to killer plumes and dinosaurs it explores claims that he writes ���volcanism shaped prehistoric and historic social trajectories.��� The film shares places with the book and narrows in on the impact of assorted eruptions starting in the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu a lush archipelago that���s home to active volcanoes."

who changes young female sidekicks in this series more than he seems to switch jackets keeps company in this movie with Felicity Jones as Sienna Brooks a lethally earnest doctor. She���s at his side in the hospital and soon on the run with him chasing and being chased while finding clues in destination sites like the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence and St. Mark���s Basilica in Venice. As in a lot of globe-trotting thrillers these (mostly real) locations are attractive backdrops for the frenetically spinning story and characters. Like the references to classical literature and art they are also meant to class up the joint adding some high-culture luster to the pulp." the Roman Catholic Church is a supporting player in ���Inferno ��� largely evident in landmarks and cultural touchstones rather than cults and murderous agents. (The script is by David Koepp.) Even so skepticism about deep faith remains most obviously in the billionaire���s deranged belief and in the image of bomb-wielding fanatics. By the end the story has shifted to Turkey and a dubiously coded landscape dotted with minarets crescents and stars. It���s there that this doomsday fantasy reaches a frothing hysterical climax and offers deliverance of a kind once again with a savior right from a promised land called Hollywood." slipping back into the role of the so-called symbologist Robert Langdon for a third time is a master of that great Hollywood sleight of hand in which a big star beguiles you so artfully that you don���t see (or simply ignore) the deception. In Mr. Hanks���s case this legerdemain depends on his natural appeal which has deepened as he���s settled into stardom as well as his ability to bring remarkable characters down to earth. That���s especially crucial with a civilian superhero like Langdon one of those preposterously capable types who wears professorial threads instead of a cape and excels at cracking gnarly codes rather than bad-guy heads." those latter-day Nancy Drews and Hardy Boys is that they���re inordinately at times vulnerably ordinary until they start doing their special thing. So when Langdon first appears in a hospital bed in ���Inferno ��� groaning in pain amid the woozy camerawork you���re ready to put a cold compress on his (or really Mr. Hanks���s) head. There���s no time. As a director Mr. Howard tends to be a lead foot either because he likes it like that (as in his racing movie ���Rush���) or knows that one of the smarter ways to handle certain material is to sprint through its twists. Here he skips ready and set and just goes." Langdon is called on to furrow his brow and fire up his genius to solve a puzzle. The main pieces in ���Inferno��� include a lethal virus and a megalomaniacal billionaire (Ben Foster) who apparently took his TED Talk too seriously. There���s a shadowy security firm with an enigmatic owner (an amusing Irrfan Khan who���s ready for Bond villainy) and the World Health Organization which has been given a sexy makeover with enigmatic players (Omar Sy Sidse Babett Knudsen) and fleets of gun-toting paramilitaries. There are flying bullets and drones racing characters and cameras nods to Dante and Botticelli." but instead borrow the emotions of the beauty they depict. (This more or less is one definition of kitsch courtesy of the philosopher Tomas Kulka.) That makes the movies easy to watch and easy to forget. As important their postcard beauty and rented emotions also attenuate some of the less palatable aspects of their conspiracy theories. There���s pleasure in watching characters solve puzzles and turn hunches into facts yet when scaled up ��� out of crime labs and onto the global stage ��� all that problem-solving suggests it���s only supermen like Langdon���s brainiac who can save the world." ��� Tom Hanks blurts out ���My God this is a labyrinth.��� Well of course it is because Mr. Hanks is running (and running) through another muddled Dan Brown maze. Once again this one comes to you from the director Ron Howard and his producing partner Brian Grazer who bring clenched-jaw commitment and a whole mess of filmmaking to every project even the most disposable. In this case the story may not make any sense but they���re going to throw so much at you ��� so many jumpy moves so many tangled threads ��� that you might not notice (or care)."

The younger Lumet was on Broadway by 1935 in ���Dead End ��� though not as one of its famous kids; he did play a dirty-faced angel in the 1939 film ���One Third of a Nation ��� a social realist fantasia. These early years are some of the most engaging parts of ���By Sidney Lumet ��� and they���re sketched in through the interviews and with distinctive archival photos and film clips." from past to present and back again. It serviceably sketches in his personal life landing harder on themes (fathers and sons) than on details a balance that would be fine if it didn���t produce some nagging questions including about women (his mother and wives). The largest problem is that Ms. Buirski has a fixed idea about his work that flattens it as underscored by her choices in film clips notably from ���12 Angry Men��� and its big speeches. Mr. Lumet comes across as a mensch but he was also a complex artist whose often literally dark films were filled with shadows rage and spit not just nobility." Nancy Buirski was brought in to turn these interviews into a movie. (Mr. Rosenbaum stayed on as a producer.) It must have been a tough gig to resist and to finish just because of its subject. Yet while it���s no surprise that Mr. Lumet can spin a tale these murky-looking less-than-flattering sit-downs are irritatingly suboptimal particularly given that he was so great at telling intimate stories about men in shadows." with no dull acts or minor characters. He was a child member of the Group Theater; as a teenager he performed alongside Lotte Lenya. When his first movie ���12 Angry Men��� (1957) opened he was 32 and a seasoned theater and TV professional having worked with Max Reinhardt Walter Bernstein Abraham Polonsky and Yul Brynner then a CBS director who helped Mr. Lumet break into TV. Over a half-century he directed more than 40 movies ��� or pictures as he called them ��� including critical and popular triumphs as well as misfires that are largely ignored here." there are dividends. A documentary like ���By Sidney Lumet ��� for instance gives you a chance to hang out with a favorite filmmaker to listen to him talk about his life and work to hear the cadences and occasional cracks in his voice. True there are moments when you wish you were watching one of his movies instead but there���s something to be said for a tribute that inspires you to revisit the films and again seek out ���Long Day���s Journey Into Night ��� ���Serpico ��� ���Q&A��� and his masterpiece ���Dog Day Afternoon.��� (Mr. Lumet died in 2011 at 86.)"

At the end you understand something about the texture and organization of life in Lampedusa and about the effect that migration has had on the island though it may be hard to put that understanding into words." thank goodness exceptions. And everything I���ve said so far is a long way of explaining what Gianfranco Rosi���s ���Fire at Sea��� is not. Mr. Rosi an intrepid Italian documentarian whose previous work has taken him to the Ganges River the California desert and inside the Mexican drug trade is certainly a filmmaker with an active social conscience. ���Fire at Sea��� is the fruit of an extended sojourn on Lampedusa an island that while part of Italy is closer to Tunisia than to Sicily. Recently it has become the landing spot for boatloads of refugees and other migrants from Africa Asia and the Middle East." which is among his great virtues as a filmmaker. He takes a hard empathetic look at reality which contains wonders as well as horrors. He doesn���t bear witness ��� an overused and often presumptuous idea. He observes with humility and precision. Instead of raising awareness he cultivates alertness. ���Fire at Sea��� occupies your consciousness like a nightmare and yet somehow you don���t want it to end." as well as grimmer tasks. Many of the men women and children packed into the battered vessels that ply the waters near Lampedusa suffer from hunger exposure and illness. Some of them who have endured their journeys below decks have been poisoned by fuel that soaks into their clothing and burns their skin." ��� as if such awareness were itself a kind of solution. The rules of the genre at least as observed by American filmmakers dictate an upbeat conclusion. As grim as things may be a solution can be imagined and the simple act of watching is implicitly part of that solution." rocky island is not easy. But he has everything the refugees have lost: a stable daily routine freedom of movement and a sense of belonging to the place where his family has lived for generations. A home in short." also all too often a graveyard. News reports of the migrants��� plight and images of overloaded boats and drowned bodies have tested the world���s capacity for indifference and also challenged the compassion of European citizens and their leaders. The debate over what to do about this crisis which is roiling politics in nearly every country on the Continent provides ���Fire at Sea��� with a context. But the film���s subject is more elusive at once more below the radar and beyond the reach of political discourse."

��� which plays with familiar form as a way to deliver unexpected meaning. A rebus a romance a gothic thriller and a woozy comedy ���The Handmaiden��� is finally and most significantly a liberation story. Mr. Park may not seem to be doing all that much with the big ideas simmering here including how the relentless pursuit of aesthetic perfection ��� especially when it comes to inherently imperfect human beings ��� can serve as a means of terror. But the ideas are here tucked into a different kind of erotic story one that alternately jolts and delights as Sookee and Hideko laugh their way to a new ending." known for thrillers like ���Oldboy ��� whose filmmaking is notable for its visual order and extreme violence a combination that creates a seductive at times unsettling aesthetic of immaculate frenzy. The violence in ���The Handmaiden��� tends to be more restrained than in some of his other work more psychological and rather less blunt and bloody. A notable exception is some sadomasochistic whip-work that���s far more vigorous than is found in oh say ���Fifty Shades of Grey.��� There���s also a characteristic Grand Guignol flourish toward the end that���s outrageous enough that you may find yourself at once laughing and gasping only to hastily avert your eyes." the winks dirtier and broader. The uncle has raised Hideko from childhood away from the world intending to wed her for her fortune. He���s also turned her into a puppet having trained her to read erotic fiction aloud for the delectation of his potential customers. Fate in the form of the con man (Ha Jung-woo) intervenes. Disguised as a count he insinuates himself into the uncle���s home and seemingly into the niece���s affection enlisting Sookee in the ruse as Hideko���s new maid. The count plans to marry Hideko and then ditch her a plan that seems doomed when Sookee and Hideko���s lady-maid intimacy steams and then boils over." as if ��� like the uncle ��� he were putting his aesthetic sensibility above all else. Mr. Park just seems to be enjoying himself too much as the camera glides over satiny robes and bodies or pauses on an exquisite tableau. In one such display as another of the uncle���s confined women narrates a tale two shoji screens behind her part an opening that mirrors the sexual conquest she���s relating. Yet Mr. Park also slips in little jokes comic line readings and clownish faces that ease the tension lighten the mood and suggest there���s freedom in laughing into the void." ��� which Mr. Park has turned into an emporium of visual delights. Part of Sookee���s journey is one from perdition into opulence from a lowly thieves��� den into the sumptuousness of the mansion. Yet appearances remain deceiving which is one of this story���s themes. Everything inside the manor and out has been calculated to enchant from the grounds with their carpets of green and bursts of flowering trees to the interiors with their wood paneling and floral wallpaper. Nothing is more perfect than Hideko���s petal mouth with its lusciously carnal red lipstick." ���Fingersmith ��� a lesbian romance set in Victorian Britain in which she slyly has her way with established literary themes like avaricious male guardians and cloistered female wards. In adapting the movie Mr. Park who wrote the script with Chung Seo-kyung has moved the story to Korea during the Japanese occupation. This setting initially seems more thread than cloth conveyed in the smatterings of soldiers who pass through the story and in the mixing of languages although it also factors into the villainy of the uncle a Korean who���s embraced a Japanese identity asserting ���Korea is ugly and Japan is beautiful.���" Sookee (Kim Tae-ri) is a pickpocket though that���s getting ahead of her story. It opens with Sookee weepily saying goodbye to some adults and wailing children their gushing matched by the torrential rain. She���s off to work for Lady Hideko (a sensational Kim Min-hee) a pale beauty who lives with her tyrannical uncle Kouzuki (Cho Jin-woong) a collector and purveyor of art and rare erotic books whose darting tongue has turned black from his ink pen. The realms of his bibliophilic senses are suggested when a client asks if one of his books is by the Marquis de Sade. ���It���s Sade-esque ��� the uncle says all but winking at the audience." too. Hideko���s uncle has forbidden her to leave the grounds turning her into a bird in a gilded cage. Under his steady gaze and severe hand with the ever-present threat of violence (there are rightfully ominous allusions to a basement) she has been raised amid material plenty with luxuriously appointed rooms as well as drawers and shelves stuffed with elegant feminine frippery ��� gloves hats gowns. Mr. Park loves displaying all these goods much like a proud merchant (or Gatsby) even as moment by moment he pushes the narrative into ugliness scratching off the gilt to reveal a grim drama in which Hideko plays both the leading lady and slave." this amusingly slippery entertainment is an erotic fantasy about an heiress her sadistic uncle her devoted maid and the rake who���s trying to pull off a devilishly elaborate con. The same could be said of the director Park Chan-wook whose attention to voluptuous detail ��� to opulent brocades and silky robes luscious peaches and creamy shoulders ��� turns each scene into an invitation to ooh aah and mmm. This is a movie that tries to ravish your senses so thoroughly you may not notice its sleights of hand."

it almost devours him. As he pursues leads Yasuko settles into a routine at home which includes attempting to befriend the neighbors. They prove a strange unfriendly bunch none more hostile and weird than Nishino who says he lives with his ailing wife and daughter. Out of loneliness boredom and more than a little narrative convenience Yasuko remains unfailingly pleasant to Nishino who after rebuffing her abruptly turns his smile and attention on her sweeping her up in a fog of ingratiating menace. This swift surprising change is itself a mystery one that feeds directly into Takakura���s rapidly overheating cold case." the allure of mystery and its perils ���Creepy��� is the latest from the prolific Japanese director Kiyoshi Kurosawa. True to its English-language title the movie is thoroughly and utterly creepy partly because Mr. Kurosawa knows how to slither under your skin but also because his movies transcend the classifications (and limits) valued by critics and content providers. ���Creepy��� certainly works ��� looks and feels ��� like a horror movie but it also has the conundrums of a detective story the emotional currents of a domestic drama and the quickening pulse of a psychological thriller a combination that creates a kind of destabilization. So what is this movie exactly?" but some of their most effectively discomfiting moments aren���t the most ghoulish or gory. Rather what spooks you are the slight shifts that turn the ordinary into the inexplicably unordinary as when curtains suddenly billow and disturb an unquiet peace or when a strange wind blows through some trees (and all the way down your neck). In ���Creepy ��� trees and bushes rustle never more ominously than in the yard of a neighbor who calls himself Nishino (Teruyuki Kagawa fantastically horrible) one of those characters whose smiles haunt dreams." the story lines and characters converge and the mystery is revealed but not solved perhaps because it fundamentally does not matter. What does is how Mr. Kurosawa mines the divide between family and work and questions the limits of love and knowledge. Don���t expect answers. Instead consider the extraordinary moment when an overhead camera pulls back from two men ��� up and up farther and farther ��� until they���re near specks as if they were being cut down to existential size. Mr. Kurosawa doesn���t explain the shot or tether it to an obvious point of view. Instead he just holds on it inviting you to fill it with meaning or simply ponder the ineffable with dread." and based on a novel by Yutaka Maekawa the movie soon divides into two parallel narrative tracks that eventually meet. Having resigned from the force after being wounded Takakura now works as a professor of criminal psychology at a local university. One day a former colleague a detective Nogami (Masahiro Higashide) drops by the school asking Takakura for quiet help on an old case. It involves a family most of whom disappeared without a trace leaving behind a mystery and a baffled mourning daughter Saki (Haruna Kawaguchi). Intrigued Takakura agrees to unofficially help reinvestigate the case." an abstract that announces by proxy some of the narrative players and developments: the detective the killer the hostage the investigation the murder the pooling blood. The story proper starts humming in the next scene. It���s a year later and Takakura and his wife Yasuko (Yuko Takeuchi) are moving into a new house with their dog. It���s a perfectly ordinary home even if the camera position and frontal presentation ��� and especially the opaqued kitchen windows ��� may remind you of that interrogation room where so much went very wrong. Mr. Kurosawa doesn���t draw dramatic attention to this resemblance but it���s there creating a connection that becomes part of a complex unnerving web of signification." for one which begins in an interrogation room where a detective Takakura (Hidetoshi Nishijima) is questioning a serial killer. Smiling the murderer seems strangely relaxed as if his crimes were routine. (Maybe they are.) Takakura ��� believing the killer an example of a ���perfect psychopath��� ��� is eager to keep examining him professional curiosity that comes across as clinical but also a touch unpleasant and insensitive. A few beats later the killer is on the loose and holding a fork (an appalling tellingly quotidian detail) to the throat of a woman; by the time the scene ends he and the hostage are dead and Takakura is bleeding having been grievously wounded."

Doris���s mother (Elizabeth Reaser) who has been trying to make a living as a fortune teller since her husband died decides to incorporate a Ouija board into her fake routine but soon the board starts calling to Doris and all heck breaks loose." ��� the 2014 horror movie inspired by the Hasbro game. Critics certainly weren���t. But its new prequel ���Ouija: Origin of Evil ��� is deliciously creepy thanks largely to a terrific performance by the youngest of its stars." and Mr. Flanagan springs some effective scares though eventually the proceedings turn a little silly. The connections to the earlier film are barely discernible; really this is a free-standing story. Movies with the Hasbro imprimatur have been uneven ��� the noisy ���Battleship���; the overstuffed ���Jem and the Holograms��� ��� but this one works pretty well by not trying to be more than just a decent Halloween-season fright fest." Mike Flanagan who with Jeff Howard also wrote the script demonstrates rare patience for horror fare as he builds toward the macabre. Annalise Basso is quite good as Doris���s older sister Pauline. Perhaps she and Ms. Wilson had coaching from Henry Thomas ��� yes the kid who played the kid in ���E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial��� ��� who here is all grown up and portrays Father Tom the priest that seemingly every movie of this stripe has to have.

visually striking movie was written and directed by Musa Syeed and is his second feature. (The wonderful cinematography is by Yoni Brook.) While Mr. Syeed whose father is Kashmiri was born and raised in the United States his cinematic mode ��� a kind of poetic realism ��� is reminiscent of the work of filmmakers like the Malian director Souleymane Ciss�� and Abderrahmane Sissako who was born in Mauritania. The substantial pleasures of the movie are supplemented by the gratification of seeing an emerging talent with concerns far outside the conventional indie realm asserting himself with such authority." the young protagonist of ���A Stray ��� is the quintessential fellow who can���t catch a break. In this movie���s first scene he���s hanging out with other Somali immigrants who chat in a mix of languages about their hard-knock lives ��� ���You���re a Somali and a Muslim no one���s gonna hire you ��� one dourly observes ��� and he reacts badly when he���s singled out for mockery.

���Moonlight��� sets itself against the earnest austere naturalism that has become a default setting for movies about social misery. Chiron and Paula certainly suffer (and inflict suffering on each other) but they are liberated from the standard indie-film arc of abjection and redemption. Mr. McCraney���s play is a layered and fractured collage of voices and while Mr. Jenkins has adjusted the shape to the linear demands of narrative filmmaking he has retained the original���s vital focus on Chiron���s inner life." pop sociology and television crime drama. But Juan like a figure in a Kehinde Wiley painting (and for that matter like Chiron too in a later phase of his story) evokes clich��s of African-American masculinity in order to shatter them." the slowness of many of the scenes the lovely hush that descends over the final act ��� is more than just a matter of style or virtuosity. It���s integral to the movie���s argument." its resistance to easy summary or categorization. I guess I���m back where I started trying to decide what this movie is about. As with any original and challenging work the answer may take a while to emerge but what strikes me now is less the pain of Chiron���s circumstances than the sense that in spite of everything he is free. A bullied neglected and all-but-silent child he grows toward an understanding of himself and his world and though it is agonizing to witness his progress it is also thrilling. To be afforded a window into another consciousness is a gift that only art can give. To know Chiron is a privilege." so richly evocative of South Florida that it raises the humidity in the theater with the faint praise of universalism. To insist that stories about poor oppressed or otherwise marginal groups of people are really about everyone can be a way of denying their specificity. The universe is far too granular and far too vast for any one of us to comprehend and Mr. Jenkins is far too disciplined a filmmaker to turn his characters into symbols." played as a wide-eyed boy by Alex Hibbert as a brooding adolescent by Ashton Sanders and as a mostly grown man by Trevante Rhodes. The nature and meaning of manhood is one of Mr. Jenkins���s chief concerns. How tough are you supposed to be? How cruel? How tender? How brave? And how are you supposed to learn?" who becomes a kind of surrogate father for Chiron. The tidy airy house where Juan lives with his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Mon��e) becomes an oasis of domestic stability a place with hot meals clean sheets and easy conversation. (Though for someone who at every stage says as few words as he can easy is a relative term.) That this comfort is purchased with the coin of his mother���s misery is not lost on Chiron. ���My mama does drugs?��� he asked Juan at the dinner table. ���And you sell drugs?��� Watching him complete the syllogism in his head and watching Juan���s reaction is heartbreaking." Mr. McCraney (and the formidable Mr. Ali) humanize Juan is to get it exactly backward. Nobody in Juan���s situation ��� or in Chiron���s or Paula���s ��� has ever been anything other than human. You might think that would go without saying by now but the radical revelatory power of this movie suggests otherwise. Like James Baldwin���s ���Go Tell It on the Mountain��� ��� or to take a more recent example like Ta-Nehisi Coates���s ���Between the World and Me��� ��� ���Moonlight��� dwells on the dignity beauty and terrible vulnerability of black bodies on the existential and physical matter of black lives." ��� the mysterious bond that links us with one another and that only an alert and sensitive artistic imagination can make visible. From first shot to last ���Moonlight��� is about as beautiful a movie as you are ever likely to see. The colors are rich and luminous. (The director of photography is James Laxton.) The music ��� hip-hop R&B astute classical selections and Nicholas Britell���s subtle score ��� is both surprising and perfect." like Richard Linklater���s ���Boyhood ��� is driven more by the flow of experience than the mechanics of plot there are plenty of twists and reversals. Chiron���s friendship with a schoolmate named Kevin (who grows from Jaden Piner to Jharrel Jerome to Andr�� Holland all excellent) evolves through a dance of camaraderie and betrayal that is better witnessed than described. A significant death takes place in the interval between two of the chapters and is mentioned only in passing. Prison sentences are dealt with in the same way. Crime violence and incarceration are facts of life but no life can ever be the sum of such facts." ��� Barry Jenkins���s second feature as a movie about growing up poor black and gay would be accurate enough. It would also not be wrong to call it a movie about drug abuse mass incarceration and school violence. But those classifications are also inadequate so much as to be downright misleading. It would be truer to the mood and spirit of this breathtaking film to say that it���s about teaching a child to swim about cooking a meal for an old friend about the feeling of sand on skin and the sound of waves on a darkened beach about first kisses and lingering regrets. Based on the play ���In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue��� by Tarell Alvin McCraney ���Moonlight��� is both a disarmingly at times almost unbearably personal film and an urgent social document a hard look at American reality and a poem written in light music and vivid human faces." equally painful and equally complicated is Chiron���s relationship with his mother Paula (Naomie Harris) who slides from casual crack smoking into desperate addiction." fleeing from a bunch of other kids who want to beat him up. Chiron is smaller than most of them ��� his humiliating nickname is Little ��� and vulnerably different in other ways as well."

That���s especially true of Reacher���s bone-crunching sadism which he rains down on opponents with the wrath of a vengeful patriarch. The character���s primitivism would fit Mel Gibson like a black leather glove." as do his loyalists who have stuck with him through the good and the bad both in perfectly tailored roles that failed to impress audiences (���Edge of Tomorrow���) and in roles that were unworthy of all his work and our love (���Oblivion���). In recent years only the apparently indestructible ���Mission: Impossible��� franchise has provided him with a steady vehicle for his talents as well as for a ride to box-office success." Reacher is one of those enigmatic borderline mystical types who surface out of the haze to handle villainy with boundless intelligence weapons mastery and annihilating violence. In the first movie ���Jack Reacher��� (2012) the menace begins with a multiple shooting that leads to a conspiracy false charges against Reacher a damsel in distress and swarms of villains. It���s an ugly pessimistic world overflowing with so much wrong that of course it has spawned a sequel with the same dreary beats." its white hats and black but this second Reacher flick recycles so much that its title feels like false advertising. (Never go back? We were just there!) Once again there are women who need rescuing even if one can handle herself nicely when bullets fly. There is yet another shooting yet more false accusations against Reacher and yet another conspiracy that leads from the power corridors of Washington to New Orleans. It���s there during yet another of that city���s conveniently colorful carnivals that costumed revelers dance carefree in the streets as Reacher battles evil which is a fairly jaundiced take on ordinary civilians." reality doesn���t cut it in fantasies like this. Reacher is a former military man as he often reminds people and unencumbered by home companion car dog backpack or even a change of clothes. (He does ride off in a white T-shirt.) All this is meant to make him seem mysterious but mostly he comes off as a blank without psychological or emotional depth. He���s the kind of heroic question mark that works only if there���s enough star charisma or filmmaking to fill in the gaps. In both movies though he���s little more than a furrowed brow and pummeling fist. A tamped down Mr. Cruise does what he can mostly by cycling through his scowls as well as running leaping and punching."

This shallow but watchable gloss on a book that conjures a searing image of the disintegrating American dream in the 1960s especially as it pertains to Jewish identity and aspiration amounts to not much more than a dutiful checklist of scenes from the novel.

How else to explain the involvement of two household-name stars (Keanu Reeves and Ren��e Zellweger) and an award-winning director (Courtney Hunt) in a plot so soulless and poorly dramatized that even the last-minute reveal is a yawn?" a cynical Louisiana lawyer whose teenage client Mike (Gabriel Basso) has apparently confessed to murdering his wealthy father. That���s convenient for his mother Loretta (Ms. Zellweger) a twitchy dame who clearly knows more than she���s letting on. As revealed in singularly unexciting flashbacks the deceased (Jim Belushi) was a boor and a bully whose sins might not have stopped at serial adultery. But Mike isn���t talking ��� to anyone." ���The Whole Truth��� plays like an especially claustrophobic courtroom procedural drably photographed and generically framed. Ms. Hunt who has a law degree made a strong feature debut in 2008 with the blue-collar drama ���Frozen River ��� a movie that burned with the intensity of Melissa Leo���s lead performance. But neither Mr. Reeves nor his co-star is given the same opportunity to shine in a script (by Rafael Jackson) that feels whittled to the bone." faithlessness and fooling around." a young lawyer with a romantic-stalker background that���s confided then simply abandoned.

Stop electing climate-change deniers." by Fisher Stevens follows the usual bearing-witness template of the celebrity-with-a-message genre. Mr. DiCaprio acting in his capacity as a designated United Nations Messenger of Peace visits melting ice fields flies over a bleak petroleum landscape pats an Indonesian elephant and so on.

The performance in Wilmington was filmed just as the 2005 tape that captured Mr. Trump talking about groping women was hitting the news; Mr. Moore���s stage material contains no mention of that controversy which has since consumed the presidential campaign.

It���s surprising to hear someone extolling a candidate���s virtues rather than just harping on what���s wrong with the opponent ��� it���s surprising to hear in other words why we should elect someone rather than why we shouldn���t." Ohio the movie captures a live stage performance by Mr. Moore in a town that leans heavily Trump (though that was not necessarily true of the audience he performed for). Mr. Moore has a knack for going into the lion���s den and poking the lion but not here.

Trump prepare to be disappointed. Mr. Moore one of filmmaking���s best-known provocateurs seems to be decidedly uninterested in provoking anyone with this new offering which had its hastily arranged premiere Tuesday night at the IFC Center in Greenwich Village. The film is not an attack on Mr. Trump but instead a paean to his opponent in the presidential contest Hillary Clinton." maybe. Or maybe not. Mr. Moore has basically made an earnest but not very entertaining pro-Clinton campaign film occasionally funny momentarily heartfelt when he takes up the subject of universal health care and the lives lost for lack of it.

in other words a political film and it���s not surprising that it has been caught up in the drama of recent Brazilian politics. In an exchange of letters recently published in Film Comment Mr. Mendon�_a Filho has noted the parallel between Clara and Brazil���s former President Dilma Rousseff impeached earlier this year in what the filmmaker and many other Brazilian artists and intellectuals describe as a right-wing legislative coup d��Ȓ�tat." a concrete symbol of Brazil���s social divisions past and present. Aquarius is a more modest structure a tidy stucco edifice with an enviable location and for Clara at least a rich history. In a mostly superfluous prologue we see her (played by Barbara Colen) in 1980 celebrating the birthday of her free-spirited aunt Lucia (Thaia Perez). After that party where we meet Clara���s husband and children and learn that she is recovering from breast cancer the action leaps forward to the present and ���Aquarius��� finds its groove." without pity or condescension and he insists at every moment on her individuality. Her temperament is woven from a unique blend of sandpaper and silk and most of the film is devoted to exploring its textures and seams. The main plot ��� Clara���s battle with the financial expedience and bottom-line corruption of the real estate company ��� flickers in and out of view so that we can spend time in her company. Which means that we also get to know her children her beloved nephew her long-serving housekeeper her best friend and the ���professional help��� Clara hires when she wants sex and grows impatient with dating men her own age." which gives its name to the movie his second fictional feature but to this nexus of place story and theme. Judging from ���Aquarius��� and its predecessor ���Neighboring Sounds ��� you could say that this director a former film critic specializes in movies about real estate in Recife capital of the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco. In the sense that is that Herman Melville specialized in books about sea voyages." with English subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 22 minutes." and Clara while a less-celebrated figure is in her own way an avatar of the nation���s cultural traditions. The author of a monograph on the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos she is a musical connoisseur with eclectic tastes (she likes Queen as well as samba) and a rigorous passionate ear. She is not an easy person to deal with but there is no denying the force of her personality the reach of her intellect or the intensity of her appetites." a long unhurried encounter with a single complicated person. And that is enough to make it a captivating film an experience well worth seeking out. But there is also as I���ve suggested more going on than the everyday experiences of a modern matriarch. Clara���s particularity is precisely what makes her such a resonant and representative figure because it���s her idiosyncratic spirit that is threatened by the sterility and greed represented by her mercenary antagonists." now a widow and portrayed by the great S��nia Braga is the last remaining resident of Aquarius and is determined to resist the efforts of the building���s owners to get rid of her. Sometimes this involves tense decorous exchanges with the proprietor���s grandson (Humberto Carr��o) a young man with a slick ingratiating manner and a North American business degree. At other times low-level harassment and passive-aggressive revenge is involved. Clara whose walls are lined with LPs and decorated with movie posters (Stanley Kubrick���s ���Barry Lyndon��� figures prominently) is adamant in her refusal to budge." shelves full of cherished books and records a heap of living ��� but it���s harder to specify what makes a home a metaphor. Kleber Mendon�_a Filho���s new film ���Aquarius ��� takes place mostly in and around the apartment where its heroine a 65-year-old music critic named Clara has lived for much of her adult life. Its rooms are spacious and sunny (the Atlantic Ocean is right across the street) but an intimation of hidden significance drifts in with the light and the breezes a hint that Clara���s home might also be a microcosm of modern Brazil." but even viewers with scant knowledge of the situation in that country will be aware of the film���s timeliness which is less a matter of ideology than of sensibility. It can be argued that Clara���s fight and the artistic vision that supports it has a conservative dimension. Clara represents values that look in the current climate decidedly old-fashioned. She is a warrior for aesthetic distinction for critical thought for sexual and creative liberty ��� for things that cannot be bought sold or indexed. And she is not someone you want to go up against in a fight."

All this embroiders the picture as does Christine���s mental health and girlish bedroom but none of this gets at why she pulls the trigger." dark hair framing her pale face like frayed curtains Ms. Hall builds her slow-burning performance with both subtly fluctuating expressive details and larger physical gestures like Christine���s hard-charging walk and way of leaning over in interviews.

Christine���s brusqueness at times suggests some kind of second-wave feminist cartoon the career gal as harridan.

And Ms. Stewart a tremendously disciplined actress holds onto just enough of the magnetism that made her a movie star to allow us to see the character both ways and to understand the ferocity of Jamie���s attraction to her." and it has the effect of rendering the other parts of ���Certain Women��� a little chillier and smaller than they might otherwise have seemed. The subtlety of the film is both an accomplishment and a limitation. It���s hard not to want more for these women and to wish you could see more of them." Kelly Reichardt���s ���Certain Women��� takes place in a region of broad skies rocky landscapes and pent-up feelings. Human beings are sparse and words are even scarcer.

looking appropriately dead-eyed and miserable committed himself to this laborious ultraviolent brain tease of a crime thriller. The movie directed by Gavin O���Connor (���Tumbleweeds���) makes little sense. The screenplay by Bill Dubuque is so determined to hide its cards that when the big reveal finally arrives it feels as underwhelming as it is preposterous. And Mr. Affleck despite a meticulous performance never uncovers a glimpse of his abused character���s humanity beyond Christian���s carefully delineated symptoms." you may anticipate scenes of Christian consorting with international outlaws and leading a glamorous double life. But no ��� there aren���t any first-class jaunts to exotic foreign capitals and no scenes of him being wined dined and entertained by strippers amid piles of cocaine. He is a tormented loner." ���The Accountant��� suggests how cruelty in the name of teaching self-defense can destroy a child. The victim Christian Wolff (played by Seth Lee as a boy and Ben Affleck as an adult) is mercilessly disciplined by his father a sadistic controlling military psychologist. It turns Christian who is autistic into a grim automaton mumbling gibberish and prone to tantrums. When dissatisfied with himself he beats his legs with a wooden stick and practices other forms of self-torture. Eventually he runs wild like a cyborg on a shooting spree." Ray King (J. K. Simmons) the ruthless director of Treasury���s criminal investigations division pressures Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) a Treasury agent with a shady past into identifying the renegade accountant. But the movie forgets about them until it���s time to tie up loose ends." but the movie remaining true to its austere ultramacho deeply misanthropic ethos doesn���t allow it." and Jeffrey Tambor has a tone of regretful defeat as Christian���s imprisoned mentor. When a mysterious bad guy Braxton (Jon Bernthal) pops into the movie you don���t know what to make of him until the very end and even then he has no place." and to recognize that his chances of a romantic relationship are ���two billion to one.���" the young Christian���s parents learn he is on the autism spectrum. In scenes where doctors are consulted and tests conducted ���The Accountant��� feels like a solemn pretentious tutorial on the subject. His parents break up after disagreeing about his treatment and daddy (Robert C. Treveiler) takes over and trains Christian so he can fight back against bullies." he takes a major legitimate client: Living Robotics which specializes in constructing prosthetic limbs. Just as the company is about to go public Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) a junior accountant at that firm discovers a $61 million discrepancy in the books and she and Christian work to trace the missing funds." and the grown-up Christian is an accountant working out of a nondescript office in an Illinois strip mall.

In a running subplot Zach Woods and Sarah Baker play married professionals who are unable to disguise their mutual loathing." ���Mascots ��� is the reappearance of the irrepressible Corky St. Clair. You may remember Corky who was introduced in Mr. Guest���s film ���Waiting for Guffman��� (1997). A hyper-effusive Broadway-besotted stage director with stereotypical gay mannerisms and delusions of artistic grandeur he was in charge of a tacky community theater pageant in Blaine Mo. celebrating the town���s sesquicentennial." vanity and adoration for their beloved canines which Mr. Guest applauded with a wink and a raised eyebrow and a sense of shared excitement. In the more detached ���Mascots ��� the fun remains but the thrill of discovery is gone." played by Mr. Guest was such a hoot that I can see why his creator was reluctant to abandon a character who doesn���t really belong in ���Mascots ��� but for nostalgia���s sake was a granted a token cameo. If Mr. Guest���s brief turn as Corky infuses ���Mascots��� with a maniacal spark it must be said that his gushy effeminate stereotype feels out of date and borderline offensive. It also contributes to the movie���s aura of d��j�� vu." it would be churlish to complain too loudly. And the sharpest verbal jokes in the screenplay by Mr. Guest and the actor and writer Jim Piddock are as inspired as ever. Mr. Guest���s gift for the archly comedic mot juste is undiminished. He and his cast still hold their own in the semi-improvisational ensemble comedy sweepstakes although it must be said that the more outlandish manifestations of reality television and YouTube have encroached on Mr. Guest���s territory." ���Best in Show.��� Amusing as it is the new film feels like a retrospective survey of this 68-year-old director���s brand of misanthropic satire which seesaws between contempt and affection for eccentric characters played to deadpan perfection by veterans of his earlier films. ���Mascots��� focuses on a contest similar to the earlier movie���s dog show. The contestants are amateur sports mascots competing to win the Golden Fluffy." ��� the Fluffies have yet to make it to the small screen. But the organizers are thrilled that the competition has drawn interest from the struggling Gluten Free Channel which is available in two markets." ��� the new movie aims dead center at a national mania for competitions that threatens to transform everyday human activities into cutthroat show-business battles designed for television with judges awards and hoopla. I can foresee a day when household chores like washing dishes making beds and vacuuming rugs are the focus of tournaments judged by ���experts.���" Eugene Levy and Michael McKean may be absent from ���Mascots ��� but reliable pros like Jane Lynch Fred Willard Jennifer Coolidge Ed Begley Jr. and Parker Posey are present and as entertaining as ever. Mr. Willard���s turn as a smug clueless oaf peppering a dwarf with inadvertently offensive questions about his size is priceless." the lecherous Canadian-Irish ���bad boy of mascoting ��� whose character the Fist more or less demolishes the stage and amid the mayhem gleefully raises his middle finger."

after all not the victim picture.) And while there may be all sorts of sociopolitical and psychological explanations for why movies are so violent it���s also just an easy way to keep people nervously waiting and watching. Mr. Maitland put in time as an assistant director on the TV series ���Law & Order��� and he understands how to narratively string out violence. The movie begins with Neal Spelce (Monty Muir) a journalist gutsily reporting from the scene while driving closer to it an opener that creates instant tension." the movie is partly based on ���96 Minutes ��� an article by Pamela Colloff that ran in Texas Monthly in 2006 the 40th anniversary of the shooting. Most of the article was an oral history based on interviews that she skillfully pieced together for a mosaiclike remembrance. Mr. Maitland borrows this approach drawing on first-person accounts as well as archival and original sources. He���s also turned much of this material into walking talking animations with the help of actors an ingenious stroke that ��� at least at first ��� helps create some needed critical distance." running a banner (���The Psychotic & Society���) across a photo of him ��� just another smiling guy in glasses ��� reading a newspaper with a small dog at his side. In time he was transformed into a popular culture touchstone in Peter Bogdanovich���s ���Targets ��� a 1968 thriller that drew on the incident; ���The Ballad of Charles Whitman ��� Kinky Friedman���s 1973 satirical song that frames the blood bath as an all-American story; and ���The Deadly Tower ��� a 1975 made-for-TV drama. By important contrast ���Tower��� isn���t about Whitman; he isn���t its subject star or selling point." a heavily pregnant freshman who is just finishing a coffee break with her boyfriend Tom Eckman (Cole Bee Wilson). As they���re walking across campus they are both hit. Claire goes down first followed by Tom. They remain where they fall for an unbearably long time creating a ghastly spectacle that becomes an emblematic tableau that Mr. Maitland returns to again and again at times using news footage. He soon adds other victims and voices including that of Aleck Hernandez Jr. (Aldo Ordo��ez) a teenager on his paper route riding past the campus his cousin perched on his bike." a 25-year-old student who shot more than a dozen dead wounding more than twice as many. A cover story in Life magazine suggested just how alien the carnage seemed at the time noting that during the rampage Whitman���s actions were ���so outrageous so hard to grasp that people could not believe it.��� Many more mass shootings later it���s now tragically easy to believe." beliefs history or health ��� in the documentary. His name is barely mentioned. He���s there throughout though represented as the unknown shooter in the frightened recordings of people phoning in reports; in police dispatch calls; in intermittent gunfire; and in the eerie puffs of gun smoke emanating from the university tower where he took position. He is a question mark a lethal void whose immateriality makes an agonizing contrast to the men and women he shot those who died as well as those who suffered and survived." Ms. Colloff noted that surprisingly perhaps outside of some bullet holes there were no physical reminders of the shooting at the University of Texas until 1999 when the school created a memorial garden. ���No plaques had ever been displayed no list of names read no memorial services held ��� she wrote. In 2007 the school finally installed a plaque observing the shooting and this Aug. 1 the 50th anniversary it dedicated a new memorial. Using a limited frame Mr. Maitland does his own commemorating inherently raising questions about terror the nature of heroism and what it means to really survive. He also does something even more necessary: He turns names on a plaque into people." a technique that involves tracing moving images by hand (as in Disney���s ���Snow White���) or through software (as in Richard Linklater���s ���Waking Life���). The results in ���Tower��� are extremely liquid with each line incessantly ebbing and flowing creating a vivid sense of life. The animation gives Mr. Maitland a lot of creative freedom allowing him to take Expressionistic leaps. When Ms. James and Mr. Eckman are shot their bodies briefly transform into wrenching twisting white silhouettes while the backdrop becomes a blast of bright red. You are spared the blood even as the horror creeps in and then floods you."

(Zachary Hernandez)." directed by Stephen Herek is based on Katherine Paterson���s award-winning 1978 book. (David Paterson her son wrote the screenplay.) Gilly���s transformation isn���t entirely convincing partly because not enough time is spent exploring the roots of her initial hostility but the story is beautifully ambivalent. There is a feel-good element but Gilly also experiences plenty of disappointments. That���s what ���coming-of-age��� is really all about: the realization that life is both kind and cruel." wanting only to be reunited with her biological mother whom she has built into an idyllic figure based on the very occasional postcard she receives from her.

in August details emerged about a sexual assault case involving Mr. Parker when he was a student at Penn State in 1999. He and his friend Jean Celestin (who shares a story credit on ���Birth���) were accused of raping a fellow student. Mr. Parker was acquitted. Mr. Celestin was initially convicted but the charges were dropped after he appealed. The accuser committed suicide in 2012. The ugliness of the episode coming to light at a time when rape on college campuses and the sexual depredations of celebrities are all over the news triggered public rejections of the movie including a powerful Op-Ed piece by Roxane Gay in The New York Times." the violation of women is the strongest least arguable pretext for male violence. It���s what makes killing the thing that a man���s got to do. But precisely because it���s such a potent and readily available premise this pat patriarchal rape-and-revenge logic is one of the things that makes Mr. Parker���s ���Birth��� feel smaller than its ambitions and less radical than it perhaps wants to be." ��� Nate Parker���s debut feature as a director presents an unusually vexing and complicated case. In the months between its debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January and its release this Friday the movie ��� which dramatizes the slave rebellion led by Nat Turner in Virginia in 1831 ��� has found itself on both sides of the argument simultaneously the must-see and the won���t-see movie of the year." ��� the assaults (filmed more discreetly than other acts of brutality) reveal the vulnerability of enslaved women. They also expose the powerlessness of enslaved men who are denied the traditional male prerogative of protecting ��� which is also to say of controlling of owning ��� their wives. In dramatic terms Nat and Hark are the victims the ones on whom the task of seeking justice falls." and Mr. Parker forcefully dismantles some of the lingering mythology about the Old South. The benevolence or meanness of individual masters makes very little difference in a society built on the total exploitation of human bodies for profit." in his controversial ���The Confessions of Nat Turner��� (1967) notoriously depicted Turner as a psychopath. Mr. Parker wants to present him as a prophet and a political thinker a mystical visionary who is also a canny tactician and theorist an amalgam of Malcolm X and William Wallace the hero of ���Braveheart.��� The elements of the character���s personality don���t quite cohere and as the movie progresses toward its bloody climax Mr. Parker���s gifts as an actor ��� his quiet sensitivity his ability to register nuances of pain and insight in his eyes ��� are undermined by his choices as a director. He occupies the center of the frame and strikes a series of warrior poses bellowing exhortations at his followers." uneven as it is has terrific momentum and passages of concentrated visual beauty. The acting is strong even when the script wanders into thickets of rhetoric and mystification. And despite its efforts to simplify and italicize the story it���s admirably difficult raising thorny questions about ends and means justice and mercy and the legacy of racism that lies at the root of our national identity. There is still a lot of reckoning to be done. Birth is a messy business. And so is what comes after." publicists and perhaps especially critics ��� would like you to think so. Buying a ticket can become a test of seriousness of personal commitment to a position or a cause. Jerry Seinfeld���s sitcom mom would not rest until her son had fulfilled the duty to watch ���Schindler���s List.��� (���Oh you have to go. You have to!���) To make other plans would have been a filial tribal and ethical betrayal a lapse only a few steps removed from outright Holocaust denial." Samuel Turner (Armie Hammer) was his childhood playmate. Samuel���s mother (Penelope Ann Miller) taught young Nat to read a small act of subversion that would have large consequences. Restricted to the Bible ��� ���those books are for white folks ��� she says of the other volumes on the shelves of the plantation house library ��� Nat grows up with a perverse pastoral calling traveling around the county to preach obedience to his fellow slaves. (Samuel pockets the money for his services.) Nat witnesses unspeakable tortures and deprivations that are also entirely routine. As he is radicalized his eloquence his charisma and his knowledge of Scripture become weapons deployed against his oppressors and the relative kindness of the white Turners proves to be an illusion." ���The Birth of a Nation��� is not ���only a movie���; it���s precisely a movie an ambitious attempt to corral the contradictions of history within the conventions of popular narrative. It dwells sometimes too comfortably sometimes too clumsily and sometimes with bracing effectiveness within long-established patterns of mainstream movie storytelling. In the context of Hollywood history Mr. Parker is less a revolutionary than a revisionist adapting old strategies to new purposes inflecting familiar tropes of violence and sentimentality with fresh meanings." the film was greeted with ovations and a lucrative distribution deal. Hollywood had sinned and redemption was at hand. Beyond that an aura of almost messianic promise gathered around Mr. Parker (who plays Nat Turner) and his movie which assumed an uncommon burden of importance. With a title evoking a grotesquely racist cinematic masterpiece and advertisements depicting the star���s head noosed in an American flag ���The Birth of a Nation��� presented itself as an indispensable document not only of the country���s brutal past but also of its inflamed and polarized present. There was no question that you would have to see it." a tale of righteous bloody punishment for an unforgivable crime. Like Steve McQueen���s ���12 Years a Slave ��� it is most powerful when it dwells on the particulars of that crime on the everyday wickedness of 19th-century slavery." but more often nowadays the principled refusal to watch a film is a response to the bad behavior proved or alleged of its maker. People stay away from Woody Allen and Roman Polanski���s movies because they believe that to do otherwise would be to condone ��� or at least not to condemn strongly enough ��� the sexual crimes of which those directors have been accused." to tell you either that seeing this movie will affirm your abolitionist bona fides or that skipping it will affirm your solidarity with victims of sexual violence. Nor is it my job to judge Mr. Parker except as the author and star of this film." heroic stature is understandable ��� this is as I���ve suggested a movie that traffics in familiar arcs and beats ��� but it also thins out the story and warps its political implications. At one point reference is made to the ���grapevine��� through which slaves in different places despite being isolated and heavily policed were able to communicate with one another. It would have been good to see that network in action and to see the larger context of resistance in which Turner���s revolt ��� hardly the only such event of its time ��� took shape." based above all on the assertion of manhood. The sexual violence of slavery is dramatized in two episodes. Nat���s wife Cherry (Aja Naomi King) is brutally attacked by a gang of white men (led by a slave-catcher played by Jackie Earle Haley). (The close-up of her battered face afterward recalls the open-coffin photographs of Emmett Till who was lynched for supposedly whistling at a white woman in 1955.) Later Esther (Gabrielle Union) who is married to Nat���s friend Hark (Colman Domingo) is ordered by Samuel to have sex with one of his friends after a dinner party."

Rachel���s fantasy duo turn out to be Megan (Haley Bennett) and Scott (Luke Evans) a married couple who tend to pose or rut whenever Rachel���s train conveniently passes by. Megan also likes to stand on her balcony playing peekaboo with her robe and flashing her undies and tummy. Or at least that���s how Rachel sees Megan. That���s also how we see Megan an outlook that���s meant to change as the points of view shift diverge and unite. As always much depends on who���s telling the story." who plays Rachel the story���s hub. She was once married to Tom (Justin Theroux trying out his smile) who���s now married to Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) with whom he has a baby.

She���s a sloshy mess or so we���re meant to believe from her alternating lightly or heavily smeared eyeliner which functions as a kind of mood ring-Breathalyzer. She���s a masochist: She stares out of a commuter-train window at the house where she lived with Tom and where he now lives with Anna and their child. Rachel is also a fantasist: She ogles another couple dreaming about their lives." a device that here is nothing but empty mannerism ��� as lob them at the screen.

When Megan disappears Rachel turns detective if one mildly hindered by her drinking and narratively convenient habit of blacking out which means that she doesn���t always know what���s happened in her own life. Rachel goes through a crucible of agony braving abuse infertility betrayal and ravages of the body and the mind. But she looks. And she learns including about other women. That���s the moral of this story the appealing gleaming jewel in the trash." suspicious characters ugly emotions freewheeling gender stereotypes and a slowly kinking mystery that becomes as perilous as the labyrinth at the Overlook Hotel. With a troika of dubious female narrators the book isn���t an obvious choice for the big screen partly because of its rotating first-person voices. One problem is how to get into those separate heads which the director Tate Taylor has tried to solve with voice-overs and by piling on close-ups creating a proximity approaching the dermatological." well it is and it isn���t. There���s always something to be said for an entertainment that sustains its nuttiness all the way to its twisty finish. This one may not make much sense but ��� like a demented old film noir or a Shonda Rhimes show at its crazed best ��� ���Girl��� doesn���t falter in its absurdity or commitment to its own seriousness. It never winks. You may laugh (as the audience I saw it with did on and off) but there���s genuine pleasure in that mirth." Rachel is a stand-in for us the viewer the voyeur who peers into other lives. Specifically she���s a proxy for the consumer of a certain kind of glorious romantic fiction in which beautiful women suffer magnificently. Hollywood used to excel at these kinds of stories movies in which say Bette Davis or Ingrid Bergman suffered endured and suffered some more before their teary square-jawed set-shouldered triumph. Those types of movies aren���t all that common in American cinema these days partly because women and their stories aren���t. The sobs and drama nonetheless did keep flowing first in daytime soap operas and later in nighttime soaps." especially because she doesn���t really appear that far gone. She may drink way too much but well she looks like the lovely spunky and very appealing Ms. Blunt just with chapped lips splotchy skin and raccoon eyes. Like almost every star in a mainstream vehicle who plays a problematic character Ms. Blunt ��� her persona filmography likability relatability ��� serves as a kind of assurance from the filmmakers to the viewers not to worry that things will turn out all right. Her stardom is our light at the end of the dark tunnel a flickering promise which is one thing that hasn���t changed much since the days of old-studio female martyrdom."

It���s a blink-and-you-miss-it moment that both makes the heart sink and lights a fuse. Subsequent moments of lightheartedness including a scene at a bazaar that���s practically redolent of the multifarious spices sold therein are freighted with that terrible knowledge. And as Mr. Fahdel depicts the tone of the state propaganda heating up via various living room televisions a stomach-churning tension mounts." we know. The film���s second part ���After the Battle ��� is a little surprising in that it depicts its subjects trying to maintain ordinary life amid the rubble and military checkpoints. American soldiers are shown treating the citizens of the land they invaded as if they were minor nuisances like insects. Yet Mr. Fahdel���s family responds to its new reality with a kind of resigned resilience. (While the movie doesn���t reprise Vice President Dick Cheney���s confident assertion that the United States forces would be ���greeted as liberators ��� this film like so many other pieces of Iraq War reportage lends that prediction an awful hollow irony.)" oppressive criminal and worse. Yet something that Westerners can recognize as ���ordinary life��� took place in certain sectors of Iraq during his rule.

Shooting on video in his brother���s home near Baghdad he shows his niece and nephews watching television one morning; a piece of state propaganda referring to Hussein as ���Beloved Leader��� soon gives way to a Looney Tune cartoon featuring Foghorn Leghorn." certain events that seemed to be portents of a hopeful future are counteracted by wartime catastrophes including finally and most terribly the death of a family member of which the director had informed viewers (with that fleeting text) in the first half. It is almost unbearable to sit through which is as it should be. ���Never think that war no matter how necessary nor how justified is not a crime ��� Ernest Hemingway wrote. ���Homeland: Iraq Year Zero��� is both an irrefutable proof of that statement and a nagging reminder that the statement is insufficient to address the ultimate tragedy of war."

Some (like a galvanizing Angela Davis) are more effective and persuasive than others; at least one ��� Newt Gingrich speaking startling truth to power ��� is a jaw-dropper. Even with its surprise guests the movie isn���t especially dialectical; it also isn���t mainstream journalism. Ms. DuVernay presents both sides of the story as it were (racism versus civil rights). Yet she doesn���t call on say politicians who have voted against civil rights measures for their thoughts on the history of race in the United States. She begins from the premise that white supremacy has already had its say for centuries." infuriating and at times overwhelming Ava DuVernay���s documentary ���13TH��� will get your blood boiling and tear ducts leaking. It shakes you up but it also challenges your ideas about the intersection of race justice and mass incarceration in the United States subject matter that could not sound less cinematic. Yet Ms. DuVernay ��� best known for ���Selma ��� and a filmmaker whose art has become increasingly inseparable from her activism ��� has made a movie that���s as timely as the latest Black Lives Matter protest and the approaching presidential election." ���13TH��� picks up Ms. Alexander���s baton and sprints through the history of American race and incarceration with seamless economy. (Mr. Averick also edited the movie.) In its first 30 minutes the documentary touches on chattel slavery; D. W. Griffith���s film ���The Birth of a Nation���; Emmett Till; the civil rights movement; the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Richard M. Nixon; and Ronald Reagan���s declaration of the war on drugs. By the time her movie ends Ms. DuVernay has delivered a stirring treatise on the prison industrial complex through a nexus of racism capitalism policies and politics. It sounds exhausting but it���s electrifying." history and the criminal justice system including those in the mainstream. One popular textbook ���The American System of Criminal Justice ��� states that the 13th Amendment ���had little impact on criminal justice.��� And a booklet on the Constitution ���Know Your Rights ��� available through the Justice Department reads: ���The 13th Amendment protects every person in America ��� all races and creeds citizens and noncitizens children and adults ��� from the bondage of slavery. It is unconstitutional for slavery to exist in any form or by any name.���" ghastly statistic by statistic ��� but you���re also charged up by how the movie���s voices rise and converge. It���s like being in a room with the smartest people around all intent on rocking your world. Ms. DuVernay is working within a familiar documentary idiom that weaves original handsomely shot talking-head interviews with well-researched occasionally surprising and gravely disturbing archival material. All these sources in turn have been shaped into discrete sections that are introduced with music and animation. Every so often the animation underscores an interviewee���s point as in one sequence in which the word ���freedom��� morphs into flying birds and then the Stars and Stripes and then a slave ship." but hers is a powerful cinematic call to conscience partly because of how she lays bare the soul of our country. Because as she sifts through American history you grasp the larger implications of her argument: The United States did not just criminalize a select group of black people. It criminalized black people as a whole a process that in addition to destroying untold lives effectively transferred the guilt for slavery from the people who perpetuated it to the very people who suffered through it." tracing the history of systems of racial control from the years after the abolition of slavery all the way to George Zimmerman���s speaking to a police dispatcher about the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. ���He���s got his hand in his waistband ��� we hear Mr. Zimmerman say shortly before fatally shooting Mr. Martin. ���And he���s a black male.��� When this documentary reaches its culmination which features graphic videos of one after another black man being shot by police Ms. DuVernay���s rigorously controlled deconstruction of crime punishment and race in the United States has become a piercing keening cry." Ms. Alexander (the most charismatic of the movie���s interviewees) argues that mass incarceration exists on a continuum with slavery and Jim Crow. As one of ���the three major racialized systems of control adopted in the United States to date ��� it ensures ���the subordinate status of a group defined largely by race.��� Under the old Jim Crow state laws instituted different rules for blacks and whites segregating them under the doctrine of separate but equal. Now with the United States having 25 percent of the world���s prisoners a disproportionate number of whom are black mass incarceration has become ���metaphorically the new Jim Crow.���" as the title indicates in ways that may be surprising though less so for those familiar with Michelle Alexander���s 2010 best seller ���The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness.��� Ratified in 1865 the amendment states in full: ���Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.��� As Ms. Alexander underscores slavery was abolished for everyone except criminals.

He pops up in a section on the rise off mass incarceration during the 1980s that���s tied to crack cocaine and the racial gap in arrests and sentencing.

At the same time her camera ranges freely and widely within that world zeroing in on tiny instances of strangeness and beauty and looking upward and outward at the sky and everything under it." and in the hands of a more prurient director ��� Harmony Korine or Larry Clark say ��� ���American Honey��� might have been a leering cautionary tale. Instead the movie is a sprawling anthology of contradictory feelings sensations and genres. It���s an episodic travelogue a coming-of-age chronicle and an indictment of grim social conditions with roughly equal measures of Jack Kerouac J. D. Salinger and Charles Dickens in its DNA." though the awfulness and grandeur that ���American Honey��� discovers is the product of Star���s restless Emersonian consciousness. Ms. Lane who like most of the cast has no previous professional acting experience is a fierce self-contained riddle. Star is almost childishly na��ve but at the same time ruthlessly self-assured heedless of danger and intuitively aware of the power she possesses." through Oklahoma and Nebraska and the Dakotas alighting in truck stops and oil fields as well as suburbs and trailer parks. Sometimes these spots are shot through a filter of exoticism with the eye of an artist from elsewhere who is fascinated appalled and intoxicated by the amber waves of grain and the sparkling sands of our diamond deserts." a boisterous snaggletoothed dreamboat with suspenders a braided rattail and an eyebrow piercing. He���s not exactly boyfriend material but he and Star pursue a romance (in defiance of Krystal���s rules) that has real heat and genuine tenderness. Jake is both a bit of a jerk and a wounded lost boy and Star certainly has her own issues but the movie declines to treat her as a victim or a sinner and refuses to set her up for punishment or rescue. Being young poor female and unloved is a raw deal for sure but Star���s instinct for survival and her appetite for pleasure inoculate her against pity." ��� Andrea Arnold���s new film (her fourth feature and the first set in the United States) might find a spot between Grant Wood���s ���Gothic��� and Green Day���s ���Idiot.��� This is not solely a matter of alphabetical order. ���American Honey ��� which takes its title from a song by Lady Antebellum is a roaming rambling road picture propelled by sex hip-hop and close-ups of insects. It probes the murk and terror beneath the surface of contemporary life and illuminates the vital role of ignorance poor judgment and wishful thinking in our national character." and might be telling the truth ��� ���American Honey��� tells a tale of youthful recklessness that could easily have swerved into moralism or exploitation. Star (Sasha Lane) first seen Dumpster diving with her two younger siblings inhabits a sad prairie landscape of big-box stores and strip malls. Sexually abused by the lecherous drunk she calls Daddy and all but abandoned by her mother she runs away with a band of feral teenagers who travel the country in a white van selling magazine subscriptions door to door and sleeping in cheap motels." ��� long and messy as it is is by turns observant and exuberant and sweet in a way that is both unexpected and organic."

Minutes later Greta is approached by three snooty girls who condescendingly offer their friendship; when she doesn���t know how to respond they sashay off." and the house suddenly fills with teenagers dancing to Sylvester���s 1978 disco hit ���You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real).��� Greta also has a moody older sister Genevieve (Imogen Archer) whose handsome boyfriend affects the air of a Gallic lounge lizard." ���Girl Asleep ��� offers a giddy approximation. Much of this uncategorizable hybrid of a movie and children���s theater piece is played out on an elaborate stage set." whose most famous work ���The Uses of Enchantment ��� analyzed fairy tales from a Freudian perspective. Shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio the film originated as the third part of a theatrical trilogy mounted at the Windmill Theater in Adelaide. For all its flirtation with nightmarish imagery it is too sweet-natured to be scary." ���Girl Asleep��� threatens to be a cute comedy about social misfits who rescue each other but it quickly takes a sharp left turn and morphs into a surreal exploration of that in-between age when childish fears and fantasies collide with the realities of teenage society. The story begins in earnest when Greta���s eccentric parents Conrad (Matthew Whittet) and Janet (Amber McMahon) over her strenuous objections decide to bring her out of her shell by giving her a 15th birthday party to which they invite the entire school." Elliott appears and confesses to Greta that he wants them to be more than friends and is shattered when he tries to kiss her and is rudely rebuffed. Increasingly anxious she flees the party plunges into the woods behind her house and embarks on a through-the-looking-glass adventure that is the movie���s centerpiece. In the forest she flees the sounds of barking wolves and encounters mythological creatures as well as family members in storybook disguises. The movie is so aggressively art directed that its strongest creative force appears to be its scenic designer Jonathon Oxlade whose imaginative whimsy evokes Tim Burton at his most lighthearted." and enigmatic signs are posted in unlikely places. At such moments ���Girl Asleep��� conveys a sense that anything might happen. As it seesaws between Greta���s conscious and unconscious minds the movie begins to feel like a waking dream."

To Ms. Lipstadt���s chagrin she and her legal team must focus on disproving Mr. Irving���s evidence." he challenges the defense to find holes in the collapsed roof of the gas chambers at Auschwitz through which cyanide pellets were pumped. A scene in which Ms. Lipstadt and her legal team visit Auschwitz shrouded in winter fog injects a note of elegiac sadness that is deepened by Howard Shore���s hushed score. But the moment for all its eerie beauty feels forced." jovial portrayal of Mr. Irving who argued his own defense as a canny trickster with an impregnable ego." where she teaches history by offering $1 000 to anyone who can prove the Nazis gassed Jews at Auschwitz.

and the movie doesn���t give it short shrift. Nevertheless a genuine exhilaration holds throughout. You can tell that the interviewees who weren���t there (including the contemporary jazz pianist Jason Moran and Ben Ratliff a former music critic for The New York Times) dearly wish they could have been. Many viewers will feel similarly." the esteemed American photojournalist W. Eugene Smith was at a personal and professional crossroads. Several years spent on a productive but ultimately abortive project (documenting the city of Pittsburgh) forced him to sell his large home in Croton-on-Hudson N.Y. His marriage ended. He acquired a Manhattan loft on Avenue of the Americas in the 20s ��� then known as the flower district ��� where his immediate neighbors were up-all-night musicians. A different resident might have complained of the noise. But Smith whose predilection for recording eventually developed into something like a mania started shooting and taping and kept at it for almost a decade." ��� a fascinating documentary directed by Sara Fishko tells the story of Smith���s peculiar endeavor and pays conscientious tribute to the man���s artistry. It also tells several other discrete stories within the larger narrative. Superb portraits of the arranger and composer Hall Overton and the protean saxophonist Zoot Sims figure here. The Icarus-like rise and fall of Ron Free a jazz drummer from the South is largely related by Mr. Free himself. The preparations for Thelonious Monk���s celebrated 1959 big-band concert at Town Hall are laid out in thrilling detail in the last third of the movie."

Phiona���s awakening sense of her talent is the engine that drives the main plot of ���Queen of Katwe��� and also what makes it an affecting character study. When she starts to learn chess she can barely read and her growing awareness of the powers of her mind is thrilling to watch. Ms. Nair makes this process as visible as palpable ��� as irresistible ��� as any boxing match or soccer game." who teaches the game to Katwe���s children as part of a youth ministry. Robert whose own youth was scarred by poverty and war has an engineering degree but lacks the connections that would help land him a job working for the government or a private company. He is an inspiring coach ��� when Mr. Oyelowo wants to inspire you you are darn well going to be inspired ��� and also a sly and cheerful class warrior. He fast-talks his way into a chess tournament held at a snooty private school and proudly leads his charges into battle against opponents who are reluctant to shake their hands." the film directed by Mira Nair based on Tim Crothers���s book and enabled by the magical corporate synergy of Disney and ESPN belongs to a genre that specializes in defeating skepticism and swelling the stoniest hearts. Just as surely as a creaky door or a clap of thunder will summon shivers of fright the thousandth time you hear it so will the spectacle of a scrappy group of strivers following their unlikely coach to victory bring lumps to throats and tears to eyes. Did ���Hoosiers��� make you cry? ���Queen of Katwe��� will wreck you." there is always a chance that somebody somewhere will be able to resist it. For all I know that may be the case with ���Queen of Katwe ��� but if there is anyone out there capable of remaining unmoved by this true-life triumph-of-the-underdog sports story I don���t think I want to meet that person." well-dressed schoolboys beaten by a girl ��� a poor girl at that ��� would be satisfying even if ���Queen of Katwe��� were a less vivid and engaging movie. In Ms. Nair���s hands Phiona���s story has a richness and unpredictability that separates it from other superficially similar movies. It also has the buoyant cleareyed feel for the particulars of culture and place that is among this director���s great gifts evident in films as different as ���Mississippi Masala ��� ���Monsoon Wedding��� and ���Vanity Fair.��� Phiona���s circumstances are harsh and the film hardly minimizes the brutal choices and painful limitations placed on women like Harriet and Night. Nor does it suggest that winning chess matches is a magical solution to the world���s injustice. ���Hope is not a tactic ��� Robert likes to say. But despair is not a strategy and Ms. Nair and the screenwriter William Wheeler refuse to turn African life into a pageant of grimness and deprivation." the Ugandan capital and it is the hometown of Phiona Mutesi a chess prodigy played by Madina Nalwanga in her film debut. Phiona lives with three siblings under the watchful tired eye of their mother Nakku Harriet (Lupita Nyong���o) who has lost her husband and another child and who scratches out a living selling food on the street. The family never has enough money and Uganda is depicted as a country of stark inequalities ruled by an unforgiving cash economy. Shelter schooling medical treatment and transportation to the hospital after an accident must be paid for up front. Harriet her mouth a permanent frown is nearly consumed by worry and fatigue. Her eldest daughter Night (Taryn Kyaze) has taken up with an unsavory guy on a motorbike. The middle children Phiona and her younger brother Brian (Martin Kabanza) scarcely have enough to eat." and there is nothing here they won���t be able to handle. Adults meanwhile can surrender to some old-fashioned melodramatic pleasures as the busy plot takes in Harriet and Robert���s struggles as well as Phiona���s. But in the end it is Ms. Nalwanga who will rivet all eyes in the way that untrained naturally charismatic screen performers sometimes can especially when supported by actors with the technical expertise of Ms. Nyong���o and Mr. Oyelowo."

Directed by Rob Cannan and Ross Adam it revisits Ms. Choi and Mr. Shin���s harrowing ordeal from beginning to end by using a variety of sources. These include original interviews notably with Ms. Choi (Mr. Shin died in 2006); archival news material; clips from the movies the couple made in South and North Korea; and dramatic re-creations. It traces the arcs of Ms. Choi and Mr. Shin���s personal and professional lives before and after they were married. There were many movies many awards and a couple of children along with dark swirling clouds largely because of Mr. Shin���s serious money problems." this one may sound familiar: In 1986 a popular South Korean actress Choi Eun-hee and her ex-husband a once-successful film director Shin Sang-ok entered the United States Embassy in Vienna and said that years earlier they had been kidnapped by North Korea ��� where they had been held against their will ��� and were now seeking asylum. It was stranger than fiction and also true (mostly maybe)." even if sometimes the results raise serious ethical questions about the subject the audience and when the art of the real turns into the rank exploitation of the same. Alas the dramatic re-creations in ���The Lovers and the Despot��� often undermine the movie because Mr. Cannan and Mr. Adam have a bad habit of trying to juice up already sensational material as in a staged scene of two people running toward freedom camera shaking. And because the filmmakers don���t identify the images they sample it can be impossible to tell if you���re watching fact or fiction. This obfuscation is doubtless intentional but it can make the documentary feel exploitative. Ms. Choi and Mr. Shin actually lived through this." though defecting to a totalitarian country seems like a deranged career move even for a filmmaker down on his luck. The documentary leans toward skepticism about Mr. Shin which isn���t a singular take. In the book ���North Korean Cinema: A History ��� Johannes Sch�_nherr writes that when Mr. Shin was working in South Korea he ���was not shy when it came to who he was collaborating with.��� Collaborating is such a heavy word and implies so much.

Nearly all of his films are ultimately about taking the measure of a man and ���Snowden��� is most effective as a character study. As ever Mr. Stone���s interest in women is limited. They provide pictorial variety and emotional complication challenging and humanizing the heroes as the story requires. Ms. Woodley has more screen time than Sissy Spacek in ���J.F.K.��� or Joan Allen in ���Nixon ��� but she is in effect portraying an updated version of the loyal long-suffering uncomprehending wife." Edward falls under the sway of two antithetical father figures a silky apparatchik played by Rhys Ifans and an unbuttoned renegade played by Nicolas Cage. Drawn to intelligence work out of a sincere desire to serve his country Edward is not immune to other attractions of the job. He likes the intrigue the money (especially after he becomes a private contractor) and the feeling of being part of a select group of insiders who know how things really work." the relationship between Lindsay and Edward is the key to the film since it establishes what is at stake for the hero as he faces the conflicting demands of love and duty. It also affirms that he is a nice normal humble guy neither a zealot nor an egomaniac. Not everyone will agree with this ��� Donald J. Trump Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are all prominent nonmembers of the Edward Snowden fan club ��� but ���Snowden��� makes its case with skill and discretion." tragic ambition in the mold of Richard M.

(His girlfriend Lindsay Mills is played by Shailene Woodley.) And ���Snowden��� is by Mr. Stone���s standards a strikingly sober film. Restraint shows in both the filmmaking and the politics. There are very few wild bravura visual flights and not much in the way of wild conspiracymongering. Edward is a rational ethical creature ��� ���responsibility��� is one of his favorite words ��� and the movie takes pains to be reasonable. Its basic argument about government data-collection would not be out of place on the Op-Ed page of this or any other newspaper. And its dialogue and pacing would work just fine on television." or maybe the world has caught up with him. What used to be paranoia ��� the idea say that your electronic appliances are spying on you ��� looks nowadays like blunt realism. It can also seem as if the physical world that bloody sex-infused battleground of the self where previous Stone heroes have raged and fought had been displaced by a more abstract zone of codes and algorithms. Edward passes from one realm to the other when an injury ends his career as a United States Army Ranger. ���There are lots of ways to serve your country ��� the doctor tells him and soon enough his bosses at the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. are explaining that the real war is being waged on computer and cellular networks." ���Snowden��� is both a return to form and something of a departure. Mr. Stone circles back to the grand questions of power war and secrecy that have propelled his most ambitious work and finds a hero who fits a familiar Oliver Stone mold. Edward (Joseph Gordon-Levitt leaning hard on a vocal imitation) is presented as a disillusioned idealist a serious young man whose experiences lead him to doubt accepted truths and question the wisdom of authority. He has something in common with Jim Garrison in ���J.F.K.��� and Ron Kovic in ���Born on the Fourth of July ��� and also with Chris Taylor and Bud Fox the characters played by Charlie Sheen in ���Platoon��� and ���Wall Street.���" I found myself wishing that it would go further ��� that it would feel angrier crazier more frightening. But that would have made it easier to shake and perhaps also to dismiss. This movie won���t necessarily dazzle or enrage you and I���m not sure that it wants to. What it wants ��� what Mr. Snowden himself always claims to have wanted ��� is to bother you to fill you with doubt about the good intentions of those who gather your data and tell you it���s for your own protection." ��� a quiet crisply drawn portrait of the world���s most celebrated whistle-blower belongs to a curious subgenre of movies about very recent historical events. Reversing the usual pattern it could be described as a fictional ���making of��� feature about ���Citizenfour ��� Laura Poitras���s Oscar-winning documentary on the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. That film seems to me more likely to last ��� it is deeper journalism and more haunting cinema ��� but Mr. Stone has made an honorable and absorbing contribution to the imaginative record of our confusing times.

The Hong Kong hotel room where Edward meets with Ms. Poitras (Melissa Leo) and the journalists Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) and Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) is an eerie futuristic box.

the dybbuk may upend the celebrations but the revelers do far more damage. The party begins as one of those bacchanals filled with choreographed chaos flowing alcohol and tumbling bodies that at times seem almost mandatory in Eastern European cinema. Mr. Wrona takes an alternately cool and hot view of this tumult by turns pulling back for critical distance at other times diving into the muck. It���s by turns entertaining and exhausting though eventually the whole thing grows heavier more solemn as the party transforms into another reminder about how rapidly the so-called civilized slip into barbarism.

Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes." ��� blurring the divide between past and present. The Polish director Marcin Wrona who wrote the movie with Pawel Maslona has thoroughly reconceptualized the mythology of the dybbuk for 21st-century Eastern Europe.

It���s while tooling around that Peter accidentally digs up a human skeleton a discovery that unearths a world of trouble most obviously in the form of a dybbuk who very soon takes possession of his body the wedding party and the couple���s happily ever after." ��� a modern ghost story haunted by the Holocaust opens with an arrival and closes with a departure. These scenes each set on a raft gliding on a deceptively tranquil country river bookend a movie that raises light shivers by tapping into historical memory and employing some satisfying bluntly old-fashioned screen magic. The movie���s visual style narrative ellipses and weighty subject make it ready-made for the art house even if its mystical flourishes ��� an otherworldly claw an undead bride ��� are the sort of woo-woo pleasures more often scared up in genre stories." the story opens with Peter (the Israeli actor Itay Tiran) who���s moved from Britain to a small Polish town to wed a local beauty Zaneta (Agnieszka Zulewska). Peter speaks Polish more than just passably but he���s an outsider and treated as such by his warily welcoming future father-in-law Zygmunt (Andrzej Grabowski). Peter seems oblivious to Zygmunt���s strained enthusiasm for the marriage and instead plunges into Zaneta���s arms and into the bonhomie of her brother Jasny (Tomasz Schuchardt) a glad-handing bellower who likes to pass a bottle around and refers to Peter by his somewhat ominous nickname: Python." ��� by the Polish playwright Piotr Rowicki but also shares much with ���The Dybbuk: Between Two Worlds ��� by the Russian ethnographer and revolutionary Shloyme Zaynvl Rapoport (a.k.a.

Instead he dies and his spirit enters her body as a dybbuk ��� the evil soul of a dead person. (���I���ve returned to my beloved and I���ll never leave her!���) The realms of the dead and the living are inseparable in this story where wedding parties dance around a ���holy grave��� to ���cheer and comfort��� a couple murdered in a pogrom." and right from the start he slips in enigmatic details and figures ��� the prowling bulldozer a keening woman a scowling man ��� that disturb the ordinary scene. Like pebbles dropped in water these disturbances create concentric circles that spread disrupting everything. By the time the newlyweds are dancing in the farmhouse barn surrounded by raucously celebrating progressively drunk family and friends the dybbuk has crashed the party.

The tale of JT Leroy���s unmasking still has a tawdry tabloid fascination and Ms. Albert���s account of her frantic attempts at spinning and wagon-circling are in some ways the most forthright part of her narrative even if she still seems a bit wounded that anyone could have doubted her or JT." JT���s biography was so lurid as to verge on the preposterous and his writing combined pornographic content with greeting-card sentimentality. Its appeal was based largely on the ���facts��� of his miserable magical life."

We see no hint of these though as we watch Mar�_a (Mar�_a Mercedes Coroy) a young Maya woman and her parents work the land and care for their livestock. Their actions are languid and explicit; yet there���s a ritualistic precision to the way they slit a pig���s throat and scrape off its hair that���s more hypnotic than repellent." this luminous first feature from Jayro Bustamante has scenes of such tactile intimacy that the trust between the director and his mostly nonprofessional cast is unmistakable. Colors are rich and deep (the gorgeous wide-screen cinematography is by Luis Armando Arteaga) and the atmosphere is so tranquil that the whoosh of action in the final third is powerfully disorienting." ���Ixcanul��� is finally a painful illustration of the ease with which those who have can prey on those who don���t."

It���s apt advice. ���Kubo and the Two Strings��� was made by Laika Films the outfit behind such quirky and visually arresting pictures as ���Coraline��� (2009) and ���ParaNorman��� (2012). The action in ���Kubo��� begins at night with a desperate woman at sea fighting off waves with her small boat and a shamisen (a Japanese three-stringed lute) imbued with magic powers." a boy with an eye patch and some powers of his own including storytelling and origami which he combines to entertain the locals of a Japanese village near the cave where he and his mother settle. Kubo���s mother needs to hide them from something and all the increasingly depressive woman will say to her son is that he isn���t to stay out after dark." fanciful story written by Marc Haimes and Chris Butler soon expands to include a protective no-nonsense talking monkey (voiced by Charlize Theron) a samurai warrior cursed into giant insectdom (Matthew McConaughey) and menacing masked twin sisters from the moon (Rooney Mara). George Takei is also featured and Art Parkinson gives voice to Kubo." the idiosyncratic 3-D visual conceits (including floating eyeballs undersea) are startling and the story and its metaphors resolve in unexpected and moving ways. The director Travis Knight has put together a picture that hits a lot of all-ages-entertainment sweet spots while avoiding hackneyed conventions and ends up delivering what feels like a sincere family-friendly message. The movie���s blend of stop-motion animation for the main action with computer-generated backgrounds is seamless creating what is the most visually intoxicating of all Laika���s movies." swordplay and floating eyeballs."

A counselor at the youth center suspects that Morris is a drug dealer. The other kids blithely give voice to obnoxious assumptions about his basketball skills and his sexual prowess. He���s either a mascot or a scapegoat." ��� Chad Hartigan���s charming new film begins with a father-son discussion of hip-hop an argument about beats flows and hooks. It���s partly an affectionate intergenerational dispute; 13-year-old Morris (Markees Christmas) is skeptical of his father���s old-school dogma while his dad Curtis (Craig Robinson) dismisses his son���s taste as too pop. The conversation also provides a clue about the movie���s own strategies.

Mr. Hartigan whose previous features as a director are ���This Is Martin Bonner��� and ���Erin and Brie Are on a First Date ��� handles the film���s racial dimensions with a gentle touch. The movie���s most satisfying achievement is its sense of proportion. There is plenty of drama in a teenager���s everyday life ��� no need to sensationalize ��� and ���Morris From America��� feels true to both the pleasures and the frustrations of its title character." but the love between them is the beat that drives the movie���s flow.

If there is anything harder than being a 13-year-old boy it���s living with one and Mr. Robinson and Mr. Hartigan nail the particular challenges of that condition as well as anyone I can think of.

Curtis a former soccer player in the United States is on the coaching staff of the local team and the rest of his back story is conveniently blurry.

Judah and Messala are kindred souls of different faiths and their dispute which is barely explained is purely religious." which like every other biblical element comes across as a rushed perfunctory nod to tradition devoid of emotional or spiritual resonance. The fates of Judah���s mother and sister are treated as items on a checklist of familiar characters to be cited and then forgotten." a Jewish prince in Roman-occupied Jerusalem and his adoptive brother Messala (Toby Kebbell) who falsely accuses Judah of treason and leaves him to rot on a Roman slave ship ��� were embodied in the 1959 movie by Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd. Playing Judah Heston reached his career pinnacle as a sweaty symbol of virtuous heroic masochism and super-masculine beefcake with a halo." Gore Vidal one of the original uncredited screenwriters wrote about the gay subtext suggesting that Mr. Boyd���s Messala was Judah���s spurned lover. As you watch it today and notice Boyd hungrily eyeing Heston it seems clear that the homoerotic overtones were intentional though Heston furiously denied it. They lent the movie a frisson of sexual tension and a lurking question: What if?" however competent is no match compared with Heston���s heaving oratorical gravitas which gave even casual remarks the ring of Scripture declaimed from a mountaintop. If anything Mr. Huston���s Judah is smaller than life. He seems physically too fragile to withstand the horrors of being shackled on a slave ship where he and his fellow prisoners row to an incessant booming drumbeat as their captors stand over them with whips. It is in these galley scenes that the new ���Ben-Hur��� finally finds its rhythm after a frustratingly long and confusing dramatic setup." ��� the kitschy 1959 sword-and-sandals epic that captured 11 Oscars and elevated Charlton Heston to Hollywood sainthood the first order of business is to create a bigger and better version of that movie���s climactic chariot race." and squealing horses topple in clouds of dust amid the deafening clamor of amplified hoofbeats the 10-minute scene powerfully captures the savagery of life-or-death spectacle and the delirium of a mob swooning with blood lust." ���Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ.��� Earlier iterations camouflaged the brutality under a thick fog of piety. This latest version pays only lip service to the weepy religiosity of the previous adaptations which include a mini-series two silent films (including the 1925 blockbuster starring Ramon Novarro) an animated version and the 1959 juggernaut. Here a handsome moist-eyed Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) pops up now and then to mouth nuggets of sage wisdom and compassion to anyone who will listen but his followers one of whom is Judah���s sweetheart Esther (Nazanin Boniadi) are barely noted." Morgan Freeman coifed in long gray dreadlocks plays Sheik Ilderim a horse trainer who becomes Judah���s coach and champion as the big day approaches. He also serves as the film���s occasional narrator." except for Mr. Freeman ���Ben-Hur��� feels like a film made on the cheap although it looks costly. It needed a star like the Russell Crowe of ���Gladiator��� to provide dramatic heft. What is ���Ben-Hur��� without a platform of moral grandeur? Not much." conditioned to accept previously unimaginable degrees of screen and television carnage this ���Ben-Hur��� feels disturbingly and appropriately up to date. What makes it all the more horrific is the film���s lack of a strong redemptive counternarrative and the absence of even a pretense of holiness. At the very end it timidly tries to preach a message about revenge and forgiveness but its heart just isn���t in it.

Reveries of the Connected World��� is Werner Herzog���s documentary about the internet. For some readers that sentence will be sufficient. One of our most intellectually ambitious filmmakers ��� a self-professed seeker of ecstatic truths a tireless foot soldier of cinema ��� tackles what he calls ���one of the greatest revolutions��� humanity has experienced. The combination of Mr. Herzog���s doggedly curious sensibility and the mysteries of the digital universe seems both improbable and irresistible." ���Lo and Behold��� is to some extent Mr. Herzog���s dream of the internet. Divided into 10 brief chapters it is impressionistic rather than comprehensive. Many of the ideas are familiar and some important aspects of life in the digital era are examined superficially or not at all. Though Edward Snowden���s name is dropped there is not much attention to surveillance or spying and the uses and abuses of connectivity as a tool of corporate and state power are barely explored." which gives a curiously dated feeling to parts of the film. Sebastian Thrun a founder of the online learning company Udacity enthuses about the transformative potential of his courses but the widely reported failure of those courses to realize their supposed potential does not come up. Skepticism is really not Mr. Herzog���s thing. Often he seems content to burnish the myths and personality cults that color so much popular thinking about the internet." Reveries of the Connected World��� is not rated. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes." and the invisible ubiquitous networks that link them are often seen to be ushering us toward utopia or hastening the arrival of the apocalypse. Mr. Herzog an unseen interviewer with an unmistakable voice seems receptive to both views. He listens to scientists and entrepreneurs celebrate the expansion of knowledge and learning that the digital revolution has brought forth and to others who lament the erosion of privacy and critical-thinking skills. The physicist Lucianne Walkowicz explains how a solar flare could bring the whole network ��� and with it our super-technologized way of life ��� crashing down in a matter of days. On the other hand we might build self-driving cars perfect artificial intelligence applications that permanently erase the boundary between people and machines or even create colonies on Mars." Mr. Herzog���s imagination leaps beyond even the more startling speculations of his subjects. He is not so much credulous as excitable given to interrupting the prose of researchers and analysts with flights of poetry. He tries to press some of them to predict the future something scientists are generally reluctant to do. And he poses a question that charms and stumps many of them: ���Does the internet dream of itself?���" folly bravery and genius that makes every individual unique. He is a patient listener with an ability to nudge his subjects off their internal scripts and like his other documentaries this one is full of strange small moments of unanticipated revelation." that curiosity has most often taken Mr. Herzog who will turn 74 on Labor Day into frontier zones where civilization gives way to wildness. He has ventured into Antarctica Alaska the jungles of the Amazon and the forests of his native Germany in search of oddity and revelation. The web might seem like a fairly tame environment for such an adventurous temperament but it is also the repository of ��� or at least the inspiration for ��� mind-blowingly grandiose ideas." Mr. Herzog communicates compassion and astonishment in equal measure. The internet is an elusive quarry. It���s a marvel and a menace a banal fact of life and a force for incalculable change. But it���s also less the subject of this captivating uneven film than an excuse for its director to add to his collection of memorable faces and voices."

no movie this welcoming to silly hats deserves our complete condemnation. Apparently raiding ���Game of Thrones ��� ���Lord of the Rings ��� ���Star Wars��� and ���Dune��� (sandworms!) the writer and director Takeshi Nozue whips up a pop-culture pastiche that leaps from modern cities to medieval castles and from paved roads to alien moonscapes with head-spinning randomness.

��� Natalie Portman���s directing debut addresses a hugely complicated and consequential moment in 20th-century history: the founding of the state of Israel. There is no simple way to tell the story and Ms. Portman���s film closely based on a memoir by the Israeli novelist Amos Oz is full of mixed emotions and chronological tangles. But despite the geopolitical momentousness ��� and present-day potency ��� of its concerns it���s an elegant and intimate movie a thing of nostalgic whispers and sighs rather than polemical slogans and shouts." it���s also an intensely literary film preoccupied with language ��� Hebrew which Ms. Portman speaks fluently ��� and preferring nuances of mood and memory to details of plot. Before he was the acclaimed writer Amos Oz the narrator and protagonist was Amos Klausner born in Jerusalem in 1939 to parents who had escaped the accelerating horror of Europe. In the years following the climax of that horror family members find themselves caught up in the conflict confusion and excitement leading to the end of the British mandate and Israel���s war of independence." idealism and disappointment they are at once actors in a sweeping international story and guinea pigs in a risky political experiment. Amos (Amir Tessler) is an alert and watchful child and the entwined dramas of Zionism and his parents��� marriage are filtered through his quizzical consciousness." as her son understands it ��� is an implicit critique of that idea. One theme of ���A Tale of Love and Darkness��� is that a dream come true is inevitably a disappointment a notion that seems to allude to one of the foundational mottos of Zionism. ���If you will it it is no dream ��� Theodor Herzl an architect of modern Zionism said but Fania suffers precisely from an atrophy of will and an inability to dream." with English subtitles.  Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes." at least is the literary and ideological diagnosis that Ms. Portman teases out of the pages of Mr. Oz���s dense and sprawling book. On a more literal biographical level Fania suffers from a psychological malaise exacerbated by the condescension of her in-laws (Arieh���s mother remarks that Fania���s borscht is ���almost flavorful���) and her own mother���s cruelty. She suffers perhaps a little too beautifully like a heroine of melodrama. But that is partly how her son remembers her." depending on the particular fantasy. She ended up instead with a Lithuanian-born literary critic Arieh (Gilad Kahana) whose nerdiness verges on caricature. ���You���ll be bullied in school ��� he tells his son. ���But not because you���re Jewish.��� And for him that���s the essence of Zionism: not redemption or perfection but normalcy." which is in every way the opposite of a vanity project. If anything Ms. Portman seems constrained by her own modesty by a justified but nonetheless limiting reverence for her source material." Fania (Ms. Portman) is bookish and melancholy haunted (at least in her son���s recollection) by memories of her home in Ukraine and plagued by headaches and other ailments. The boy���s interpretation of his mother���s condition ��� offered by his older self (Moni Moshonov) who serves less as narrator than interpreter of his childhood ��� is that her romantic European temperament was unsuited to the hard realities of the Middle Eastern desert. The world she left behind is imagined as a lush shadowed fairy-tale environment a stark contrast to the dry sun-bleached reality of a fledgling modern nation. Her death announced at the outset is the film���s central obsessive unsolvable mystery." ��� a conscientious adaptation of a difficult book breathes a little more freely when it leaves the claustrophobia of the Klausner household and allows young Amos to confront the world outside his parents��� shadow. At those moments often when Ms. Portman herself is offscreen her directing also feels more open and self-confident and you understand that in telling the story of how Mr. Oz developed his voice she has gone some distance toward discovering her own."

The old man also owned the building where Tony���s mother Leonor (Paulina Garc�_a) runs a dress shop and if ���Little Men��� is a love story it is also a tale of economic conflict in a rapidly changing city a fable about the insidious toxic power of money and real estate." two middle schoolers who cross paths in Brooklyn.

In other words ���Little Men��� is on the side of Jake and Tony as both a narrative strategy and a moral choice. Their temperaments and backgrounds are different as are their interests. Jake is a hothouse flower his artistic talents and sensitivities carefully cultivated by his parents. Tony whose father travels for work and is almost never at home (Hernan a friend of Leonor���s played by Alfred Molina is around a lot) is more of a free-range kid.

the unnamed Little Girl (voiced by Mackenzie Foy) who is about to turn 9 is relentlessly pushed by her fiercely controlling mother (Rachel McAdams) to gain admission to a snooty school and spend all her spare time studying. The poor child is overscheduled within an inch of her life: A calendar charts her existence down to the millisecond." the film���s caricature of the digital age atmosphere is so forbidding that it makes the charming fancies of ���The Little Prince��� seem quaint and frivolous. The movie a Netflix release receiving a theatrical run can even be seen as an allegory about filmmaking in today (by a director of ���Kung Fu Panda���) straddling the line between modern and traditional styles and blending the best of both. Inevitably youth vigor and technological innovation triumph over nostalgia." as if wary of seeming too spaced-out devotes more time than necessary to its contemporary frame and not enough to the original story. That said the framing delivers an unusually forceful and imaginative depiction of a child���s-eye vision of the grown-up world: a fearsome urban jungle peopled by expressionless robotic beings weighed down by responsibility." the most emotional involves his fraught romance with a vain high-strung rose which drove him to leave the asteroid.

Climbing through the hole in the fence separating their houses the Little Girl begins a clandestine through-the-looking-glass friendship with this dreamer who tells her of his aeronautical adventures of decades past. At this point the stop-motion animation enters the movie. Mr. Bridges affecting a grandfatherly voice gives the film a steady warm emotional glow." ��� Mark Osborne���s reimagining of Antoine de Saint-Exup��ry���s 1943 children���s classic is its side-by-side use of two styles of animation. Today���s cold corporate world in which gray-faced hunched-over adults grimly slog through life is depicted in severe rectilinear computer-generated animation. The magical universe of Saint-Exup��ry���s wistful poetic novella is rendered in stop-motion animation with pastel shades that evoke his original watercolor illustrations." the Saint-Exup��ry story is far from the kind of smugly reassuring children���s fable manufactured by Hollywood nowadays. The Aviator entrances the Little Girl with the story of the Little Prince a boy from a distant asteroid whom he encountered in the Sahara after his plane crashed." as a boy is voiced by Riley Osborne (the director���s son) and as a young man by Paul Rudd. Albert Brooks is especially menacing as the rapacious Businessman who boasts of owning all the stars in the heavens. Leavening the movie is a jazzy period score by Hans Zimmer and Richard Harvey through which are woven songs by the French chanteuse Camille and fragments of vintage French chansons by the singer and songwriter Charles Trenet." the story of ���The Little Prince��� is not especially happy although the screenplay by Irena Brignull and Bob Persichetti puts as euphoric a spin as possible on events. That tale unlike the modern shell into which it���s been nestled is deliberately flighty (if you���ll excuse the pun). It involves the pain of abandoning childhood dreams growing up and accepting mortality."

Mr. Jarman who died in 1994 worked in a variety of formats and while his shooting style here seems largely un-self-conscious it���s clear that he had a good grasp of whatever expressive potential the VHS camcorder held. The lens flare the ghosting effects the garish and inaccurate color; all these will touch off nearly as much nostalgia or anti-nostalgia for the 1980s home-video hobbyist as the disco tunes might for any late boomer or early Gen X-er.

It could easily have lapsed into didacticism or into the kind of sentimental wishful thinking that so often afflicts Hollywood���s attempts to deal with the seductive morally ambiguous world of big money." Erin as a scheming underling and Samantha ��� who lives a respectably funky middle-class life in Park Slope with her wife and their two adorable children ��� as the voice of justice and decency. One of the accomplishments of the movie and of Ms. Reiner Ms. Thomas and especially the amazing Ms. Gunn is to make the viewer reflect on how deeply ingrained such images are and to challenge them even as it exploits their tenacity." as in Ruthless. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes." deceit and treachery as well as sexism. There are plenty of men in the movie ��� not all of them bad guys by any means ��� but at heart it is the story of three women. Naomi Erin and Samantha (Alysia Reiner) a government lawyer who investigates insider trading and is an old acquaintance of Naomi���s. As another important I.P.O. looms there is plenty of jeopardy to go around and the plot turns on a complicated series of alliances and betrayals." ��� says Naomi Bishop in an early scene in ���Equity.��� In 21st-century America ��� especially in the finance industry where Naomi works ��� that hardly counts as a radical statement. But Naomi speaking to a group of professional women is making a point less about her own feelings than about the gender stereotypes and sexist assumptions that prevail in the business world. She contends that although women have grown more comfortable asserting their ambitions they haven���t fully embraced the competitive dynamic of modern capitalism." she is committed to the path she has chosen even if it means spending time apart from her husband and pretending to flirt with co-workers and clients. Naomi simply by virtue of being a woman over 40 is expected to be warm and maternal and Erin for similar reasons is expected to reciprocate or at least to play along with sexual attention from men. Nobody comes out and says anything gross or actionable ��� this is not ���Mad Men ��� and every company has binders full of rules about appropriate conduct ��� but the lessons are clear indisputable and dismaying." however is bracing witty and suspenseful a feminist thriller sharply attuned to the nuances of its chosen milieu. In setting and mood it bears some resemblance to J. C. Chandor���s ���Margin Call ��� which similarly infused sleek and sterile corporate spaces with danger and dread. But unlike that film or Adam McKay���s ���The Big Short ��� Ms. Menon���s movie is not about the system in crisis. It���s about business as usual." the value of sisterhood or the glories of the free market ��� are likely to be frustrated even shocked. But ���Equity��� pulls off a difficult balancing act with an elegance that should not be underestimated. It turns its unflappable gaze on a maddeningly complex reality and transforms it into a swift clear and exciting story." efficient script by Amy Fox ���Equity��� takes Naomi herself as a test case. Played by Anna Gunn with a striking blend of unguardedness and poise Naomi sits in a spacious office near the top of a big investment bank. She is comfortable with power and confident in her own abilities even as she is aware of the double standards and hidden biases that surround her. In spite of a recent setback ��� an I.P.O. she was handling went bad ��� she is the very image of success with a beautiful apartment a handsome lover (James Purefoy) and the respect of her colleagues." and to some extent the film is a cautionary tale a warning about the hidden traps and double binds that lie in wait. A copy of ���Unfinished Business ��� Anne-Marie Slaughter���s book about ���how women still can���t have it all ��� makes a brief pointed appearance onscreen and ���Equity��� dramatizes some of its arguments about the impossible choices women face in the workplace. One of the most wrenching scenes involves the childless Naomi���s figuring out that her prot��g��e and vice president Erin (Sarah Megan Thomas) is pregnant. The look on the younger woman���s face ��� pure panic eating away at the obligatory mask of joy ��� haunts the rest of the movie."

the images are reminiscent of the empty haunted spaces associated with the art cinema of Andrei Tarkovsky and Bela Tarr. But Mr. Geyrhalter���s method is more austere and the effect produced is subtly different. Each individual shot creates a frisson of desolation that resonates far beyond the facile irony suggested by the movie���s title." provocative Austrian director Nikolaus Geyrhalter could be described as an environmental documentary. Its form is as simple as death. A stationary camera takes in one after the other a single image of a space constructed (or simply scarred) by humankind and subsequently abandoned. In the first minutes of ���Homo Sapiens ��� we see railroad tracks a bicycle rack and the rudiments of a train station." each image is discrete and none are subject to further examination. Although the film���s credits include a foley artist and a rerecording technician its soundtrack comes across as entirely v��rit��; the wind whispers birds chirp and the people who built the settings we���re seeing are far far away if they���re even around at all. The first section of the movie has vending machines with Japanese characters on them. While Mr. Geyrhalter did not as it happens bring cameras to the vicinity of Fukushima where an earthquake and tsunami led to a nuclear disaster that precipitated mass evacuations in 2011 it���s probable he wishes the viewer to make a connection.

Whatever the case there���s something appealing about the movie���s relative quiet though it makes Ms. Rozema���s job increasingly difficult because she needs to fill that silence with something. To that end she tucks in an occasional happy-and-sad-times flashback and taps some of the significant drama-goosing incidents from the novel including one that finds Robert gone and the sisters on their own. Every so often Ms. Rozema also folds in a beauty shot of the lushly green forest with its dense flora and chirping snuffling fauna." she does what she can with these sisters ��� her recast Snow White and Rose Red ��� with their mommy-daddy issues and efforts to stretch their provisions a struggle that���s mirrored by Ms. Rozema���s attempt to stretch this story.

Ms. Rozema tries to build tension and sustain interest by thickening the atmosphere and layering on details rather than big incidents. Yet while she creates intimacy as well as interiority by visually closing in on each sister as with repeated images of Nell reading alone and Eva twirling away the movie lacks urgency. The world may be burning; here it barely simmers." ���Into the Forest��� begins and ends with the volume turned down. A lot of contemporary doomsday flicks make a lot of noise pummeling subwoofers and eardrums with screams gunfire and the usual big bangs. For this dystopian fantasy the Canadian director Patricia Rozema has gone for a singularly subdued mood and soundscape which makes certain story sense given that power outages will soon silence most of the machines. About all that remains audible is the natural world���s whirring and buzzing mixed in with some sisterly sniping." who also wrote the screenplay turns out to really need that wedge. Set in the near future the story is adapted from a novel by Jean Hegland that���s narrated by Nell a sensitive smart 17-year-old who���s coming of age as the world falls to pieces. In transferring the tale from page to screen Ms. Rozema has opened the story even as she���s thinned it in perplexing ways. The movie still favors Nell a bookish pragmatist who���s studying for her achievement tests when the story starts. (Ms. Page looks young but this casting is distracting.)

It���s all attractively homey rather like a refurbished ���Little House in the Big Woods ��� except that Ma (Wendy Crewson) is dead when it opens. She pops up now and then in some flashbacks but mostly functions as an idea (of love and loss) and as a useful narrative wedge." given you know excitable human nature. With one catastrophic exception Robert registers as a sensible entirely capable soul. (Nell is very much his daughter.)

given both this industrial parenting complex and the boomlet of comedies about badly behaved women that have appeared in the wake of ���Bridesmaids��� (2011): ���Tammy ��� ���Trainwreck ��� ���Sisters��� and so on. Most of the women in these movies don���t resemble villainous vixens of old like those film noir femmes fatales who caused tough guys to go weak in the knees and murmur ���Baby I don���t care.��� Most of these funny ladies aren���t even particularly naughty. They just do things that women aren���t supposed to do or more truly don���t often do in mainstream American movies like pound shots fall flat on their faces and have sex without tears." they seem to be just everywhere onscreen and offscreen in comic-book flicks in childhood-destroying comedies and even in the presidential race. The latest big-screen evidence that women are hot (kind of) and not simply in a frat-boy way is ���Bad Moms ��� a funny giddy sentimental laugh-in from Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who wrote the 2009 hit comedy ���The Hangover.��� That movie pretty much ignored the ladies but made enough money to spawn another smash and a second less successful sequel that may have killed off the franchise." pinwheeling center of ���Bad Moms ��� she enters in heels at full speed a pace she keeps up as she sprints from one demand to another often with her two children in tow.

Nixon that she makes for a school project a dog wearing a helmet an office run by giant children. (Clark Duke plays her boss while Christina Applegate Jada Pinkett Smith and Annie Mumolo offer backup as the grown-up mean girls ��� i.e. the momsters.)" which here mostly involves kicking back something Amy does after she boots out her cheating husband and stops coddling her kids. (They���re forced to eat cold cereal. From a box.)

If I could write sonnets I would write one about Ms. Hahn whose timing ��� she finds depths in that little pause before a joke crests ��� can turn laughs into howls." there���s a reason. Much like ���The Hangover��� (Mr. Lucas and Mr. Moore can take writing credit and blame only for the first movie) ���Bad Moms��� is a comedy of outrage pegged to a gender stereotype this time the smother mothers of America. You know the type or maybe you���ve just read about her in lifestyle articles featuring enlightened parenting and gluten-free snacks. She���s the one who ��� in between enjoying a fulfilling career and flipping through cookbooks for vegan cookie recipes (for a bake sale natch) ��� ferries the kids from school to soccer and whatever other extracurricular activities can pad a college application." the movie���s yuks are tame stuff. What makes ���Bad Moms��� funny (aside from its lineup of gifted performers) isn���t that Amy and her friends go wild; they don���t not even close. It���s the women���s shared near-orgiastic pleasure in their freedom and friendship. In the most comically honed and sustained scene Amy Kiki and Carla run mild and a bit loony ��� and in slow motion ��� through a supermarket where they rip open boxes chug booze and (absurdly) terrorize a guard their every offense turned into an epic of blissed-out destruction by the decelerated visuals. There���s nothing genuinely transgressive about their behavior; they���re just drunk happy and together." but she���s good for a laugh. She���s also been good for sales. You could fill an entire Amazon fulfillment center with parenting books with a few rows reserved for putatively bad or just guilt-ridden moms. These range from high-end reads like Allison Pearson���s ���I Don���t Know How She Does It��� to down-market manuals with expletive-ridden titles like one coyly subtitled ���The Parenting Guide for the Rest of Us.��� (If a lot of these humor books seem to focus on mothers it���s probably because that���s the way the world still turns although you also have to wonder if stories about terrible fathers cut too queasily close to the bone for mass readership.)"

Not every wheel needs reinventing and one of the abiding pleasures of ���Star Trek ��� in its old and newer iterations lies in its balance of stubborn consistency and canny inventiveness. The characters never change but the stakes can shift wildly from one adventure to the next. Fans love ���Star Trek��� precisely because of its episodic nature which allows for a certain amount of variation in theme and tone. Sometimes the future of the universe hangs in the balance. Sometimes Kirk and his crew have to deal with local disputes and personnel issues. Or weird random stuff like tribbles or Joan Collins-related time travel."

Chris Pine who has played Kirk since the big-screen reboot in 2009 is on his third voyage. This character originated by William Shatner has endured a lot more. The larger ���Star Trek��� enterprise has been boldly going on for a half-century and more hours of television and cinema than I possess the Googling acumen to tally." a good soldier and also a bit of a loose cannon might want to break out of the rut and the title of the latest movie ���Star Trek Beyond ��� teases the audience with the promise of novelty and risk. It���s not necessarily a criticism to note that not much materializes. Directed by the action maven Justin Lin from a script by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung the film answers the question ���Beyond what?��� with a diffident ���Well nothing really. Don���t worry!��� It should have been called ���Star Trek Within��� in honor of its determination to color inside the lines obeying the ironclad conventions of brand and genre."

this movie takes place within the hermetically enclosed universe of its maker���s long-established preoccupations. Rather than find fresh themes or problems he likes to rearrange the old ones into a newish pattern emphasizing some elements and letting others drift into the background. Here the dominant conceit is Mr. Allen���s well-documented ambivalence about California and the industry that has often seemed ambivalent about him. He loves movies but Hollywood with its shallowness and gossip has always repelled him." ��� someone replies." the production designer Santo Loquasto and the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro he bathes ���the film colony��� in golden light and swathes its denizens in lovely period clothes. He sends an ambitious Bronx boy Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg) out West to seek his fortune.

He���s suitably intoxicated by his new surroundings." a charming bit of trivia the punch line to a half-forgotten joke." which supplies narration sounds unusually sluggish and weary. The same is true of his voice as a writer and director. For every snappy scene or exchange there are three or four that feel baggy and half-written. We are treated to one survey of the clientele at the swanky Manhattan nightclub that is Bobby���s post-Hollywood professional perch and then a while later to another. We wander into jazz clubs and dining rooms and seem unsure of why we���ve come. Blake Lively wandering into the movie���s second half as a second Veronica seems to feel the same way. The movie seems much longer than its 96 minutes." ��� either. Which is to say that it���s neither another example of bad late Woody Allen nor much in the way of a return to form. It is overall an amusing little picture with some inspired moments and some sour notes a handful of interesting performances and the hint now and then of an idea." unfunny encounter between Bobby and a prostitute shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles; an anecdote about Errol Flynn���s sexual interest in underage girls. It���s hard to say if Mr. Allen is testing the audience���s tolerance or trolling our sensitivities or for that matter if he���s just blithely carrying on as he always has oblivious to changing mores or the vicissitudes of his own reputation." of course the passion of an older man for a younger woman. It turns out that Bobby and Phil are both in love with a transplanted Nebraskan called Vonnie (short for Veronica) who is Phil���s secretary. Kristen Stewart���s performance in the role which blends gravity and lightness glamour and its opposite is certainly the best part of ���Caf�� Society ��� but it also exposes just how thin and tired the rest of the movie is." and there are some other pretty good ones sprinkled throughout the sprawling script. Bobby���s bickering parents played by Jeannie Berlin and Ken Stott supply a few Yiddish-inflected laughs as well as the requisite touch of metaphysical fatalism. (���I accept death but under protest ��� Dad says. ���Protest to who?��� Mom responds. Also not a bad line.) The ensemble is larger and the story looser than in Mr. Allen���s last few movies making room for Corey Stoll���s relaxed turn as Bobby���s charismatic gangster brother and Parker Posey and Paul Schneider���s intriguing double act as a cynical and apparently happily married pair of bicoastal sophisticates." one fellow a few rows behind me chuckled at every name. I don���t think because the allusions were especially funny ��� the sentence ���Adolphe Menjou is threatening to walk off the set��� is not exactly a gut-buster even in context ��� but because they signified a cultural awareness that the laugher in the dark wanted the rest of us to know he shared. And also perhaps because the dropped names stood in for jokes that the modern audience is too ignorant to get and that Mr. Allen has grown too lazy to make. He can gaze back fondly at the fast-receding golden age of Depression-era popular culture and the rest of us can wistfully recall a time when he was able to spin those memories into better films than this one." ��� he says." ��� Woody Allen���s new movie comes wrapped in a double layer of nostalgia. Set in the 1930s partly in Los Angeles its script compulsively mentions Hollywood stars of the era. Joan Blondell! Robert Taylor! Barbara Stanwyck! Cagney and Crawford! Astaire and Rogers! Their names ring out like answers to trivia questions nobody had thought to ask."

��� and it���s at once a welcome admonition and an efficient motto. This compact fast-moving portrait of the artist proceeds through a flurry of images many of them gleaned from Mr. Frank���s long and prodigious career.

Nova Scotia that has been his rustic retreat for decades. Her film is less like a full biography than like a magazine profile which is as it should be. You leave with a vivid sense of the man���s living presence and a reasonably thorough account of his life work and associations." this is an impressive achievement. The son of an amateur photographer Mr. Frank may still be best known for ���The Americans ��� his collection of black-and-white images harvested during his travels across the United States in the mid-50s. At the time the pictures which cast a candid eye on racism alienation and class division were criticized for their challenge to the official optimism of the postwar consensus. Before long they took their rightful place in the photographic canon alongside the works of Walker Evans who was one of Mr. Frank���s idols and early teachers." many of which feature words or crude pictures starched onto the negative. Along with the films he made in the ���70s and after they are a chronicle of pain exuberance and spiritual calm. Interweaving footage from them with clips from older interviews and her own conversations Ms. Israel executes a biographical sketch that is informative without seeming unduly invasive.

We can be grateful that Mr. Frank still walks among us his eyes wide open." a filmmaker and photographer who was born in Switzerland in 1924 is in many ways a quintessential New York artist of a certain vintage and temperament a resident of the eclectic Bohemia that defined an important part of the city���s cultural life in the decades after World War II. He was friends with Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac who appeared in his 1959 film ���Pull My Daisy ��� for which Kerouac also provided voice-over narration. Mr. Frank had the good fortune to practice his art when living was cheap and minds were open and the genius and discipline to turn his pluck and curiosity into a vital and formidable body of work.

Bryan Cranston���s character in ���The Infiltrator��� is an alternate version of Walter White the good-guy-turned-rotten he portrayed so magnetically in ���Breaking Bad.��� This seedy drug-soaked thriller is based on a memoir by Robert Mazur (Mr. Cranston) a federal undercover agent who in 1986 posed as a high-rolling money launderer in a sting operation against Pablo Escobar���s Colombian drug cartel. Unlike Walter Robert is a good guy who remains good when faced with temptation." he also endures a weird voodoo ritual in which the man next to him is shot to death.

the same can���t be said for the film���s director Joe Berlinger who attended the seminar in 2012 and according to the publicity notes wanted to share that ���life-changing��� experience.

kind of like a new production of ���Macbeth��� or a Christopher Nolan rethink of Batman. As it turns out the original ���Ghostbusters��� is one of those durable pop entertainments that can support the weight of not only a lesser follow-up (the 1989 sequel ���Ghostbusters II���) but also a gender redo. That the new movie stars four women is a kind of gimmick of course but it���s one that the filmmakers and the excellent cast deepen with real comedy chemistry and emotionally fleshed-out performances particularly from Ms. McCarthy and Ms. Wiig who are playing old-friends-turned-sort-of foes who need to work some stuff out." the new cheerfully silly ���Ghostbusters��� is that rarest of big-studio offerings ��� a movie that is a lot of enjoyable disposable fun. And enjoy it while you can because this doesn���t happen often even in summer which is supposed to be our season of collective moviegoing happiness. The season when everyone jumps onboard (whee!) and agrees that yes this great goof is exactly what you were thinking when you wondered why they didn���t make summer movies like they used to." the redo follows much of the original���s shambling arc and even revs up with a haunted-house boo except that this time the scares happen in a mansion not a library. After the usual narrative table setting Holtzmann and her partner in kook-science Abby (Melissa McCarthy) join forces first with another scientist Erin (Kristen Wiig) and then a transit worker Patty (Leslie Jones). Voil�� the new Ghostbusters are in business complete with a vintage Cadillac some funky digs and a cute secretary Kevin (Mr. Hemsworth). Ghosts and mayhem ensue along with turns from the likes of Cecily Strong Andy Garcia and Matt Walsh." just as it���s no surprise that it took someone like Mr. Feig to figure out how to make it work mostly by not really messing with it. Even so what he���s doing onscreen ��� by helping to redefine who gets to be funny in movies ��� is what makes him a thoughtful successor to Mr. Ramis who made a series of memorable soulful comedies about what it means to be a man (���Groundhog Day ��� ���Multiplicity���). Now if we could just get women and men to be funny together that would be revolutionary." ��� which is for the most part democratically comic (a Paul Feig signature) although Kate McKinnon���s magnificent eccentric turn comes close. She plays Holtzmann the in-house mad-hatter who whips up the ghost-busting hardware (proton packs included) with a crazy leer and page after script page of playful-sounding gobbledygook. Ms. McKinnon makes for a sublime nerd goddess (she brings a dash of the young Jerry Lewis to the role with a glint of Amy Poehler) and in an earlier age would probably have been sidelined as a sexy ditsy secretary. Here she embodies the new ���Ghostbusters��� at its best: Girls rule women are funny get over it." though it would have been nice if Ms. Jones had been given more to do. (If this were a radical reboot she would have played a scientist.) In the end these are Ghostbusters not Ghostbusting suffragists even if there���s plenty of feminism onscreen and off. It���s hard to know if the movie started off being as meta as it now plays but when these Ghostbusters are labeled frauds ��� or crack jokes about ugly online comments or take on a fan boy from hell ��� it sure feels as if Mr. Feig and his team are blowing gleeful raspberries at the project���s early sexist attackers." Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. A triumph of casting and timing the first ���Ghostbusters��� remains memorable for Ray Parker Jr.���s inane dementedly catchy theme song (���Who you gonna call?���) and for Mr. Murray who dominates it even more than its Godzilla-sized Marshmallow Man monster does. It���s peak Bill Murray with a minimalism that exerts a powerful gravitational force and a deadpan that recast Mad Magazine���s what-me-worry grin with the sickness-unto-death laughter of National Lampoon." wait because whatever else you can say about the new ���Ghostbusters ��� it���s a lot like the old ���Ghostbusters ��� except that it stars four funny women instead of you know four funny men. In other words it doesn���t have a lot of XY chromosomes and basso profondo voices though its token hottie played by a game nimbly funny Chris Hemsworth pulls his weight on both those counts. Otherwise the redo is pretty much what you might expect from Paul Feig one of the best things to happen to American big-screen comedy since Harold Ramis." which means that ���Ghostbusters��� is also a female-friendship movie but without the usual genre pro forma tears jealousies and boyfriends. Friendship here even at its testiest is a given which means that Mr. Feig doesn���t have to worry it and can get on with bringing the funny with his stars and toys his ghosts and laughs. As is often the case with big-budget flicks it grows progressively louder and bigger climaxing in an overlong battle though not before Mr. Feig has offered up some unexpected touches including a cavalcade of beautifully designed old-timey ghosts and a genuinely creepy bathroom scene that adds a few horror-flick shivers."

Mr. Mortensen whose intensity has the sting of possession has a way of making you believe his characters can do whatever they set their minds to: fly leap over buildings save the world." but after all the radical power-to-the people talk he finally comes down on the side of compromise and the soft landing. It���s left to Mr. Mortensen who can make menace feel like vulnerability ��� and turn vulnerability into a confession ��� to keep the movie from slipping into sentimentality. He���s the most obvious reason to see it although Mr. Ross���s insistence on taking your intelligence for granted is itself a great turn on. His characters don���t need smartphones to do their thinking for them; he assumes the same holds true of his audience." though Ben Cash takes care of his children. For years he and his ailing dream of a wife Leslie (Trin Miller) have been living with their six kids who range in age from 7 to 18 on a compound where they have thrived beautifully without electricity a sewer line or trend alerts about the Kardashians. By day Ben teaches and trains the children racing them through the woods like Olympians or Special Forces soldiers. At night the family plays music together and reads by firelight ��� leafing through books one page at a time ��� before bedding down in the communal tepee." the outside world looms in ���Captain Fantastic��� through its stark absence even though the compound is well-equipped and stocked with necessities from that world including sharp knives heavy books and bales of mismatched clothes. Ben and Leslie have opted to live in seclusion as a matter of principle having embraced protest as an ideal. At its loftiest their profound seclusion suggests that they���re spiritual and philosophical heirs to an isolationist like Henry Thoreau; at worst it suggests fanaticism cultishness selfishness. Touchingly the children sometimes seem closer to the castaways of the Swiss Family Robinson whose self-reliance was involuntary." like a story about a little survivalist house in the woods or the start of a joke about puritanical parenting (no gluten no grease) that has Gwyneth Paltrow as its punch line. But lifestyle doesn���t begin describe the Cash family���s alternative reality and despite all the self-aware joking this isn���t a goof. From the moment the movie opens on a deer hunt ��� in a scene that suggests ���Apocalypse Now��� by way of ���Lord of the Flies��� ��� the writer-director Matt Ross makes it clear he has something weightier in store than mindful napping and snacks." where they have silly and sober encounters with strangers and relatives on the way to a collective epiphany. (Kathryn Hahn Steve Zahn Frank Langella and Ann Dowd fill out the familial ranks.) Along the way Ben keeps on keeping on about the evils of capitalism while his children discover themselves and other people including in a sweet trailer-park stay where Bo learns how to kiss a girl." a flash of silver and a smear of red. Discreetly staged and shot rightly serious and intimate the hunt turns out to be a rite of passage for the family���s eldest son the teenager Bo (George MacKay). It���s all very solemn but also over quickly and Mr. Ross has soon shifted focus to the stream of younger children straggling out of the woods. Faces and bodies smeared in mud they are a mesmerizing surreal spectacle ��� one of the smallest a Dennis Hopper-esque runt wears what looks like a skinned bobcat for a hat. Soon everyone is laughing while washing off the dirt and blood a cleansing that gives the movie something of a sustained metaphor." not simply feelings. The Cash children stumble but they���re supremely capable and self-aware. What makes them unusual isn���t their knife skills; it���s that they talk seriously about ideas. The same holds true of Ben whose worldview falters only because Mr. Ross seems anxious to soften the extremes he���d sharpened. There���s something moving about his search for balance something a little pleading too."

as in news writing there is a fine line between irresponsible alarmism and dispassionate reportage. And Mr. Gibney has a proven record of tiptoeing to the edge without going too far. The movie makes use of an actress Joanne Tucker to repeat testimony by several officials that was deemed too sensitive for these sources to appear on camera. Filmed through a digital filter she resembles the former C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame which gives her scenes the look and tone of a creepy spy thriller." the film is an often intimidating slog through jargon and computer code.

An argument is made that Stuxnet���s secrecy was blown by an Israeli software variant that may have misfired. In any case after relating the history of Stuxnet the movie dismisses it as yesterday���s news." far-reaching subject and maintain a common-sense perspective requires formidable organizational skills and a steady narrative hand to keep the movie from straying into any number of theoretical byways.

The nightmare of push-button nuclear annihilation that has haunted us since the invention of the atomic bomb now has a parallel in the looming specter of large-scale cyberwarfare." the film reveals was jointly built by the United States and Israel although neither will publicly confirm it. Numerous officials in Washington officials are questioned about its existence but none acknowledge it and a sequence of high-level stonewalling makes for dark comedy.

The lushness of the sound seems at odds with the plainness of the images and this discrepancy establishes a tone that will last through the rest of this delicate and satisfying film.

Sachi���s long discreet affair with a married doctor is the most serious such relationship in the film ��� at least to the extent that it injects some complication into the plot ��� but it hardly represents an ideal of happiness. That is to be found at home in the rush of breakfast or the weary calm of a late supper." based on news accounts of a group of siblings fending for themselves in the Tokyo apartment where they had been left by their overwhelmed mother. ���Still Walking��� (2009) is grounded in the routines of an elderly couple whose surviving children have grown up and moved away. ���Our Little Sister ��� which is played in a breezier more comical key than those earlier films settles in with three adult sisters who live together in the house where they grew up. Their father left when they were young and their mother seems to have been a marginal presence in their lives. She shows up now and then to dispense irrelevant advice. The main authority figure seems to have been a great-aunt." and we cannot account for our feeling of repletion.��� Something similar can be said about this film which goes down as easily as a sip of the plum wine the sisters brew and yet leaves the viewer both sated and intoxicated." their distinctive personalities a few crosshatchings away from caricature. Sachi is the responsible one working long hours as a hospital nurse and scolding the others when they fall short of her standards. Yoshino who works in a bank is a little wilder. She likes to drink and has a history of bad boyfriends including the good-looking loser she wakes up next to in the first scene.

this small charming movie written and directed by Mr. Gondry (���Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind���) is semiautobiographical. Behind its easygoing lighthearted tone is a precisely calibrated subtly surreal ode to that time of life when boys��� voices are changing and they experience the stirrings of interest in the opposite sex. The object of Daniel���s obsession Laura (Diane Besnier) is a taller girl who initially rejects him for being too short but later changes her mind." determined to get a haircut na��vely mistakes a Korean massage parlor for a hair salon. They run afoul of a football team after stealing the ball when it is accidentally tossed over a fence." with his leather jacket and tousled hair is a soft contemporary version of what used to be called a hood. Daniel is a classic nerd. An aspiring artist and writer he also wears his hair long but with his delicate features and refined air he is often mistaken for a girl. Although distressed by the confusion he doesn���t face the brutal rites of self-initiation endured by so many teenagers in American movies. As resourceful in his way as Theo he draws his own pornography which he hides under a mattress and uses for self-stimulation." ���Microbe and Gasoline��� risks cuteness without going overboard. Too easily taken for granted its accomplishment is its ability to gaze steadily with warmth but minimal sentimentality at the world through unjaded 14-year-old eyes." a transfer student and mechanical whiz who conceives the notion that he and his classmate Daniel (Ange Dargent) nicknamed Microbe for his small size can escape their oppressive families. Both are social outsiders." angry parents are a junk dealer and his unkempt wife who is ailing after two heart attacks. Daniel is one of three sons being raised by a clinging overprotective middle-class mother (Audrey Tautou in an atypical role)." with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 43 minutes." the journey feels like an idyllic gentle rite of passage. The house car proves to be a successful disguise that enables them to park near the side of a road and avoid police harassment as it poses as a rooted structure. They have small misadventures. Stopping on the property of dentist they are welcomed but flee through a window when he tries to examine their teeth which he declares a disaster." ��� declares Th��o (Th��ophile Baquet) the scruffier of two likable adolescent misfits who gallivant around France in a homemade vehicle. That souped-up car constructed from junk that includes a discarded carburetor that Theo repairs is the real star of Michel Gondry���s good-natured coming-of-age road movie ���Microbe and Gasoline.��� With additions this crude motorized buggy becomes a zany wooden mobile home.

The head of the money-laundering enterprise for a Russian mob Dima wants to cut a deal with the British intelligence that would guarantee the safety of his family in exchange for information about politicians on the mob���s take." a news story shows up that seems to beg for fictionalization. It���s no wonder that so many journalists love playing make-believe producers as when they write that the news they���re covering ���has all the makings of a Hollywood movie.��� These days though the major American movie studios are more in the business of comic-book intrigues than in realism.

As an Expressionist choice it doesn���t make much sense. Then again neither does much of ���Our Kind of Traitor ��� which has loads of twists and all the ritualistic pessimism you expect but none of the political and moral outrage that might have elevated this genre story into a le Carr�� one.

The contours of Mr. DeMonaco���s future America are a bit too lightly sketched to sustain that kind of interpretation. (It seems strange for one thing that a dictatorial conspiracy-minded group like the New Founding Fathers would allow free elections to go forward.) The first ���Purge��� movie focused on the psychological and ethical effects of the annual ritual. The second ���The Purge: Anarchy��� ��� the best installment so far ��� explored its social dimensions and real-world implications. Its blend of astute commentary and effective carnage might have raised hopes that ���Election Year��� would turn out to be a timely and cathartic exercise in allegorical satire." written and directed by James DeMonaco and produced under the Blumhouse indie-horror label are self-aware enough to know that they serve a similar function. While the stated moral may be that violence is terrible the visceral message is that it���s a lot of fun and Mr. DeMonaco is an able if not always terribly original painter of nightmarish sanguinary tableaus. The streets of Washington D.C. where ���The Purge: Election Year��� takes place are stages for infernal scenes of ritualized chaos as tourists and teenagers dress to kill in patriotic costumes and rave-appropriate garb." a band of rebels (their leader like Leo a returning character is played by Edwin Hodge) determined to overthrow the New Founding Fathers and end what they contend has become a cynical and merciless exercise in ���predatory capitalism.��� That���s a phrase that floats above the sound of gunfire as a calling-out of the National Rifle Association. And ���Election Year��� feints toward real-world politics in other ways as well notably in how it pits a multicultural underdog coalition against a white power structure abetted by neo-Nazi mercenaries with Confederate flags and swastikas on their uniforms." axes power tools and other weapons mostly handguns and assault rifles. Running time: 1 hour 43 minutes." but it goes about prosaic business pretty effectively. The spectacle of righteous violence in the face of terror is satisfying in ways that transcend (or sink beneath) politics. ���The Purge: Election Year��� takes itself just seriously enough to provide the expected measure of fun ��� a blend of aggression release and relief. A lot of people die but no one really gets hurt." and at this point the American public might need a break so after minimal exposition (enough to orient viewers who might have missed ���The Purge��� and ���The Purge: Anarchy���) the film gets down to brutal business. After a shocking (but not really) lapse in security Senator Roan and her security guy Leo (Frank Grillo) find themselves on the streets of the capital where they join forces with a band of independent purge dissidents: Joe (Mykelti Williamson) who owns a small grocery store; Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) his trusted employee; and Laney (Betty Gabriel) who grew up in the neighborhood and now helps operate a clandestine ambulance service." the American government has decreed that one night a year will be given over to lawlessness.

This no-frills horror film about a murderous psycho who terrorizes people unlucky enough to wander into his corner of California hill country has no fancy special effects or supernatural goings-on.

Alan Ruck as the local sheriff also adds interest. ���Carnage Park��� is a deliberate effort to recreate exploitative stalker-type scare fare of yore.

something heavy enough to justify the exhumation of such a difficult fantasy figure. He gets one by proxy in ���The Legend of Tarzan ��� which opens with some historically informed text about King Leopold II of Belgium (1835-1909) known as the butcher of Congo for his role in murdering millions. It���s a grim start to this make-believe but the mood lifts at Greystoke Manor Tarzan���s ancestral pad in Britain where he���s broodily prowling about like a caged animal. Already married to Lady Jane (Margot Robbie holding her own) Tarzan now goes by John Clayton having years earlier returned to nominal civilization and its discontents." the uneasy sometimes forlorn sometimes exuberant bridge between civilization and nature between the human and nonhuman animal world. His origin story from his cradle to his new mother���s hairy arms is related in flashback patchwork that conveys what he lost when he left the jungle ��� home world and identity. And when he at last returns to that home he has much to do including nuzzle old furred friends and lead a rescue mission that soon involves Jane along with thousands of Africans. Jane scoffs at the word damsel but she���s in distress as well as a stand-in for the abused captive black bodies that the movie shows only glancingly." from an action-and-incident-packed script by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer ���The Legend of Tarzan��� takes a while to get going. After announcing its grave bona fides it continues to engage in a lot of narrative throat clearing much of it dedicated to seeding Burroughs���s foundational story with historical facts. To this end John receives an invitation from King Leopold to return to Congo to witness the king���s putative good works. John rejects the offer only to change his mind after an entreaty from an American George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) who suspects that the Belgian king is enslaving the region���s people." who spent a lot of time baring his body along with vampire fangs on the HBO show ���True Blood ��� indicates that the filmmakers understand a primal part of Tarzan���s allure. This isn���t strictly a question of Mr. Skarsgard���s considerable physical charms though these are central to the character. (He isn���t playing nerd boy of the jungle.) Mr. Skarsgard is also a fine actor with an enigmatic melancholy a quality that has been put to expressive use in small roles in movies like ���What Maisie Knew��� and that here suggests Tarzan carries a profound burden that makes him more complex than the usual beefcake in loincloth." who occupies a chapter in Adam Hochschild���s magisterial book ���King Leopold���s Ghost: A Story of Greed Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa.��� Mr. Hochschild writes that Williams whom he calls ���the first heretic ��� was the earliest dissenter to speak out ���fully and passionately and repeatedly��� on Leopold���s atrocities. Williams deserves a grand cinematic adventure of his own and perhaps Mr. Jackson���s comfortable affable performance which like the movie itself oscillates between seriousness and gentle comedy will help make that case." big-screen things going for it ��� adventure romance natural landscapes digital animals and oceans of rippling handsome man-muscle. Its sweep and easy pleasures come from its old-fashioned escapades ��� it���s one long dash through the jungle by foot train boat and swinging vine ��� but what makes it more enjoyable than other recycled stories of this type is that the filmmakers have given Tarzan a thoughtful imperfect makeover. That must have been tough given the origin story���s white supremacy problems." but without the unsettling distractions of real suffering. It���s become trickier for pop entertainments to gloss over historical traumas which may be why so many modern colonial struggles involve deep space or an alien invasion. Perhaps it���s easier to rewrite history through futuristic fictions where worlds can collide before everyone moves on. There���s something touching about ���The Legend of Tarzan ��� which as it struggles to offer old Hollywood-style adventure without old Hollywood-style racism suggests that perhaps other fantasies are possible ��� you just need some thought and Mr. Jackson." who directed the last four movies in the ���Harry Potter��� franchise slips easily between intimacy and grandiosity and he scales up and scales down as easily as Tarzan scrambles up and down the digitally rendered trees. If he and his team haven���t reinvented Tarzan it���s because they���re working in an industrial context that still puts a premium on heroic white men even if this one doesn���t make you wince each time he turns up. Tarzan is still the white avatar flying through the African jungle with eerie skills a mighty yodel and existential issues yet the terrain he swings over is messier closer and less of a lie than it once was." black land ��� to state the excessively obvious. Probably the only real way to avoid his negative image would be to let him molder on the shelf and in our cultural memory. Except that this wild child raised by apes turned wild man forever caught between civilization and nature is a great mythic character ��� a rich dense tangle of narrative philosophical and political meanings. That partly explains why he���s been such a commercially reliable property since Edgar Rice Burroughs cut him loose in 1912 the year Tarzan roared into existence in a pulp magazine that evolved into an empire of books comics plays and films." though Williams is basically an elevated sidekick as well as a physician war veteran and crack shot who���s as proficient at suturing wounds with insects as he is mowing down swaths of white mercenaries. More interesting especially given how routine colonialist fantasies tend to play out it is Williams who voices the complexities catastrophic errors and redemptive efforts of the so-called civilized world a screen job usually given to white saviors. Williams���s polar opposite is the resident villain Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz predictably good) a silky uncomplicated sadist who embodies rapacious evil from his all-white suit to his crosslike weapon." his long hair and diamond-cut muscles gently fluttering gets at another aspect of this character���s attraction. Like a lot of Tarzan stories this one teems with striking flora and fauna much of it skillfully computer generated some of it captured on location in green green Gabon. But its most special and spectacular effect is Tarzan one of those characters who have always complicated the familiar argument that visual pleasure in Hollywood cinema is hinged on women being objects of male desire. Johnny Weissmuller the most famous screen Tarzan was an exemplary fetishized object of desire."

And while his carnivorous brethren (led by a lummox named Fleshlumpeater played by Jemaine Clement) are full of slobbery bluster they project all the menace of untrained sheepdogs." after more than four decades in the business in the gossamer glamour of the moving image. But there is something overly strenuous about this particular testament of faith. Like Martin Scorsese���s ���Hugo ��� another children���s-book adaptation from a high priest of baby-boomer movie worship ���The BFG��� is so committed to inducing a state of breathless wonder that it uses up its own oxygen supply. Adults in the audience are prodded to recapture their long-lost moviegoing innocence while their young companions are patiently directed to giggle warmly or gasp in amazement. But having someone whisper in your ear ���Ooh how mysterious!��� or shout ���Isn���t that funny?��� has a way of spoiling the desired effect. Mr. Spielberg has always been a skilled manipulator of feeling. What���s startling here is how clumsy and uncertain his attempts seem." Mr. Spielberg and his visual team (led by his standby cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) go for shimmer and glow with the exception of a few bouts of loud fluorescent flatulence called forth by the bubbly home brew that is the BFG���s tipple of choice." friendly movie an attempt to reconcile the scale and dazzle of modern filmmaking with the quiet mischievous charm of Roald Dahl���s book. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by his frequent collaborator Melissa Mathison (who died in November) it chronicles the relationship between the title character (Mark Rylance) and a young orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill)." above all is the wild palpable sense of excitement that has galvanized so many of Mr. Spielberg���s other juvenile adventures from ���E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial��� to ���The Adventures of Tintin.��� His approach to the material is dutiful and appreciative and his devotion to his own craft is impeccable.

Mr. Smith unfortunately declined to appear in the sequel leaving his two co-stars from ���Independence Day ��� Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum to give it that old school try alongside veterans like Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner far and away the movie���s most valuable player. All deliver professional winking performances but they���re also stranded in an overly crowded cast that gives too much time to younger performers who for the most part slide right off the screen." largely in funny little asides that sprinkle the action like the cutaway to a character using his wipers to clean alien goo off a windshield. But too often he seems to be trying to summon up energy and dredge up feeling in this movie by glancing back at the first ���Independence Day ��� as when Liam Hemsworth (as a flyboy) punches an alien an echo of Mr. Smith���s ���welcome to Earth��� triumphalism. Except that Mr. Hemsworth a stolid pleasant actor isn���t Mr. Smith and this isn���t ���Independence Day.��� Somehow selling screen death by the millions with a quip and a teardrop just doesn���t cut it." here he is again going once more unto the blockbuster breach with ���Independence Day: Resurgence ��� a sequel to ���Independence Day ��� his amusing 1996 box-office behemoth. The earlier movie is best remembered for its shocker of a sales pitch: a shot of the White House being blown up by a shaft of alien light an image that was as giddily funny as it was horrific to contemplate. Needless to say thinking deeply if at all has never been something that Mr. Emmerich encourages. For the most part his movies are engineered to generate autonomic responses with frenetic visuals and booming noises that activate the fight-or-flight response which in turn produces arousal." although ���Resurgence��� is likely to spur more eye-drooping than popping. All you really need to know about the story is that it took multiple men to cook up this pottage which hinges on another extraterrestrial invasion and humanity battling aliens as other familiar struggles erupt: technological determinism versus technophobia secular universalism versus heroic individualism. Five writers actually put their names on the script including Mr. Emmerich and his longtime collaborator Dean Devlin and the results are predictably predictable if rarely entertainingly risible with swaths of exposition and dialogue that sounds like ads (���one people one world���)." you have seen them all at least if it was directed by Roland Emmerich. For the last two decades Mr. Emmerich has carved out his own perverse subgenre with mega-movies about mega-calamities in which a happy few fight joke and triumph despite alien invasion a radioactive lizard the Mayan calendar melting polar ice and scene after scene of computer-generated mayhem. Even when he scales down narrowing his cinematic gun sights on smaller stories (���White House Down���) Mr. Emmerich goes big and then bigger."

Mr. Waititi started out in comedy shifting to movie directing more than a decade ago with little evident strain. His first features (���Boy ��� ���Eagle vs. Shark���) are imperfect but also unmistakably of an auteurist piece with strongly defined characters a deep sense of place and a humorously deadpan view of life���s absurdities. They���re also very sweet. More recently he and his longtime friend the comic Jemaine Clement another New Zealander directed ���What We Do in the Shadows ��� a cheerfully silly mockumentary about vampires living as roommates." the crusty geezer the nurturing bosom ��� and strips them of clich��. Charming and funny it is a drama masquerading as a comedy about an unloved boy whom nobody wants until someone says Yes I���ll love him. Much of the humor comes from the child who���s at once a pip and a gloriously expressive ambassador for the director Taika Waititi���s cleareyed take on human nature and movies. Mr. Waititi knows that we love to cry at sad and bad times but he also knows that people in pain need to get on with their lives." leaving Uncle Hec and Ricky first unmoored and then on the run in the bush where they���re chased by a social services zealot Paula (Rachel House) and her minion Andy (Oscar Kightley). Mr. Waititi likes to play with types of comedy but he���s partial to modest exaggeration whether he���s putting the joke across with slapstick songs caricature lovingly deployed insults or a flurry of tableaulike images. All the characters are funny and idiosyncratic but because they make you laugh in different ways they also register ��� with the pointed exception of the cartoonish Paula and Andy ��� as real people rather than as contrivances." as marginalized people too often are in fiction. They���re romantic and pragmatic eccentric and utterly ordinary. They���re also reasonably flawed as is this movie but Mr. Waititi transcends most of the narrative bumps and generally dodges the obvious land mines including cuteness. He���s still finding his way but he���s already a director who ��� as he does in a shot of a friendly undefeated child pausing to wave at a pursuer ��� can distill a worldview into a single perfect cinematic moment." including guns knives dangerous animals and equally threatening people. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes." which strengthens the story���s realism. Ricky is a funny kid. He���s amusing to look at for one thing what with his fish-out-of-water hip-hop threads and has a gift for bolts from the blue like the bad-boy haikus he creates (and recites) as part of his therapeutic training. As a child of social services he throws words like ���processing��� around though Mr. Waititi is careful when it comes to Ricky���s history which is scattered piecemeal throughout. Tragedy touches the characters in ���Wilderpeople ��� but it doesn���t define them and they���re not into sharing caring and closure like their American counterparts." Paula and Andy are burlesques of bureaucratic incompetency. There���s an obvious political dimension to Paula���s fanatical overblown crusade to flush Ricky and Uncle Hec out of the bush but her mania is mostly just another clown car that Mr. Waititi enjoys taking out for a spin. For the most part Mr. Waititi���s politics are as matter of fact as his humor and expressed through his gritty singular characters some of whom happen to be white others of whom happen to be Maori. (Mr. Waititi also wrote the movie adapting it from the book ���Wild Pork and Watercress��� by Barry Crump a best-selling author and self-styled bushman.)" a New Zealand foster child who as the movie opens is being placed with an older couple who live in a pastoral clearing at the edge of the bush.

which is one reason that his righteous characters ��� including Ron Woodroof in ���Dallas Buyers Club��� and Mick Haller in ���The Lincoln Lawyer��� ��� are sometimes more fun than the movies they inhabit. And while Mr. Ross���s story makes Newton unambiguously heroic this is not yet another film about a white savior sacrificing himself on behalf of the darker-skinned oppressed. Nor for that matter is it the story of a white sinner redeemed by the superhuman selflessness of black people. ���Free State of Jones��� is a rarer thing: a film that tries to strike sparks of political insight from a well-worn genre template." but in different ways. Especially after the war the alliance proves fragile as white supremacy reasserts itself with renewed brutality. Its persistence is emphasized by a subplot that takes place 85 years after the war in a Mississippi courtroom where Davis Knight (Brian Lee Franklin) a descendant of Newton���s is on trial for breaking the state���s law against interracial marriage." and certainly to Moses that the Glorious Cause of the Confederacy was a rapacious and exploitative cotton-based capitalist economy and that the resistance to Reconstruction was intended to restore that system. This view reflects the current scholarly consensus but much of American popular culture like much of American politics remains besotted by the old mythology. Freedom is a long struggle." ���Free State of Jones��� explores a neglected and fascinating chapter in American history. Mr. Ross consulted some of the leading experts in the era ��� including Eric Foner of Columbia University whose ���Reconstruction��� is the definitive study and Martha Hodes of New York University author of a prizewinning study of interracial sexuality in the 19th-century South ��� and has done a good job of balancing the factual record with the demands of dramatic storytelling. The result is a riveting visual history lesson whose occasional didacticism is integral to its power." Newton���s wife at the beginning of the movie. The romance between a white man and an enslaved black woman is to say the least a delicate issue for a movie like this to deal with but Mr. Ross handles this and other fraught matters with impressive tact and sensitivity. The film does not minimize the violence of slavery including the sexual violence that was the daily experience of women like Rachel but it also refrains from turning cruelty into spectacle. Mr. Ross has an old-fashioned faith in the power of editing and in the ability of the audience to imagine what he refrains from showing explicitly." and a romantic rebel movie of sorts ��� there are hints of ���Viva Zapata!��� and ���Shane��� and a half-dozen other underdog classics ��� but with an unusually clear ideological focus. After fleeing the army where he had served as a battlefield nurse and witnessing Confederate authorities confiscating his neighbors��� livestock and grain Newton takes refuge in a swamp with a small group of slaves who have run away from a nearby plantation including a man named Moses (Mahershala Ali) who becomes his friend and confidant. Through his conversations with Moses and with Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a domestic slave who brings the fugitives news and supplies from the plantation house Newton comes to believe that the slaves share a common enemy and a common interest with poor white farmers like himself." especially when such roles have been misconceived for so long. The wily and charismatic Newton Knight is a revisionist archetype a white Southern rebel fighting against the mythology that such figures usually embody.

Afterward he tried to hold this coalition together as a political force in the face of Ku Klux Klan terror. As played by Matthew McConaughey Newton is an ordinary man radicalized by circumstances. His hollow cheeks and wild whiskers suggest a zealous temperament but the kindness in his eyes conveys the decency and compassion that lie at the heart of his moral commitment." with a flurry of the kind of immersive combat action that has long been a staple of American movies. The setting is familiar in other ways too. As a line of Confederate troops marches across a field into Union rifle and artillery fire a haze of myth starts to gather over the action a mist of sentiment about the tragedy of the Civil War and the symmetrical valor of the soldiers on both sides of it. But this is a sly piece of misdirection: The rest of the movie will be devoted to blowing that fog away using the tools of Hollywood spectacle to restore a measure of clarity to our understanding of the war and its aftermath."

���Nuts!��� opens with sepia-toned black-and-white images of goats copulating roughly drawn and crudely animated. Along with the film���s title and the soon-to-be-revealed fact that its subject Dr. John Romulus Brinkley (1885-1942) made his name and his fortune with an impotence cure achieved via goat testicle transplants viewers are primed to settle in for an entertaining tale of made-in-the-U.S.A. bunco.

The extent of the contrivance will set off multilevel credulity alarms in viewers paying close attention. Also curious is the movie���s seeming lack of interest in Dr. Brinkley���s inner life. These apparent defects are all part of the filmmaker���s genuinely cunning strategy." archival footage and interviews with historians Ms. Lane���s narrative from Dr. Brinkley���s career roots in the once-one-horse town of Milford Kan. grows to encompass a million-watt radio tower in Mexico and more besides. The ever-taller-tale presented here documents Dr. Brinkley���s impact on early-20th-century pop culture. A Buster Keaton movie with a goat gland joke is cited as is the fact that Dr. Brinkley���s radio station besides being a showcase for his medical advice was the first to feature all country music." the animation and the archival footage shift to bright color but the story grows more convoluted and bleak. The movie culminates in a cinematic coup de gr��ce bold enough to spin your head ��� one that gives the movie an entirely new dimension.

During his career Mr. Farrier has interviewed Justin Bieber reported on eels and looked into the cover art of black-metal bands. He has a particular talent for the outr�� however having made as he puts it in the movie ���a career out of looking at the weird and bizarre side of life.��� So when he came across a video of cute buff and clothed young men tickling and being tickled he knew that he had a story." which they piece together with restraint and fine technique using a clear direct approach that serves the material. (At this point I should mention that a defamation lawsuit was filed on behalf of the mystery man.) They more or less stick to the documentary-as-investigation model in which a filmmaker plays the onscreen investigator-inquisitor. Mr. Farrier however is less of a showboat than some documentarians who assume that role and after a while this measured quality feels as much an ethical choice as a matter of temperament.

Jane O���Brien Media was holding a monthly event called Competitive Endurance Tickling.

Mr. Farrier ��� who has an enviable deadpan ��� says that he wondered if this was a ���tickling league ��� noting that participants were all in Adidas gear. He doesn���t say anything about the ticklees in wrist and ankle restraints; if this were a league it was the kind the characters in ���Fifty Shades of Grey��� might join. Instead like the reporter he is Mr. Farrier turned his inquisitiveness into an investigation." I suspect tickling is a verb not a world. You would be wrong! Tickling has more going for it than a red plush toy named Elmo ��� it has scholars scientists deep thinkers.

somewhat hopefully announces the documentary ���Raiders! The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made��� recounts the amusing ups and periodic alarming downs of a singular handmade project. In 1982 two Mississippi boys ��� Eric Zala 12 and Chris Strompolos 11 ��� set out to create a shot-by-shot remake of Steven Spielberg���s ���Raiders of the Lost Ark ��� which had hit theaters the year before. For seven years as these boys became men they called action and rolled camera painstakingly feverishly recreating Indy and his high-flying adventures." deliriously. For them the remake wasn���t a casual backyard frolic the kind that imaginative young minds generate after school and before dinner. This was a full-blown feature-length production with dressed actors and sets period detail and even dangerous pyrotechnic special effects. Eric created the meticulous storyboards partly guided by his surreptitious recording of the original movie���s audio (this was before home video took off) and served as the baby Spielberg. Chris put on a rakish fedora to play Indiana Jones running and cracking the whip as his body and voice changed." charmingly awkward clips from the remake scattered throughout this documentary. Like latter-day versions of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn Eric and Chris were ingeniously resourceful. They brought in another friend Jayson Lamb as their cinematographer and special-effects specialist and together they turned a yard into a jungle stenciled hieroglyphics on walls and used a dog called Snickers to play the role that had been performed by a spider monkey in the original ���Raiders.��� Summer after summer these friends convened as the early 1980s gave way to the late and Pac-Man gave way to Game Boy." even when viewed piecemeal is that it���s a testament to the transporting glories of movie love to that passion that sweeps you up whether you���re sailing over the rainbow with Dorothy or riding shotgun with Ripley into the abyss. It���s a fever that can become a kind of madness send lovers soaring or spiraling and that sometimes turns fans into directors writers scholars programmers and even critics. What���s especially moving about ���Raiders! ��� though ��� and which is evident in the snippets from the remake and the behind-the-scenes glimpses of the boys and their friends ��� is that this passion is incredibly pure it���s their first love and their greatest." this new endeavor ��� which involves blowing up a plane among other hurdles ��� comes across as quixotic but it soon starts to feel like self-promotion. As the documentary details Mr. Zala Mr. Strompolos and Mr. Lamb are having an extended moment which began in 2002 when ���Raiders!��� was screened at a festival in Austin Tex. The audience���s thrilled reaction lit a long fuse: Vanity Fair published an article about ���Raiders!���; a fictional movie about its making was announced; and this documentary ��� a fan film about the making of a fan film ��� happened. Mr. Zala and Mr. Strompolos meanwhile started a production company ��� and so it goes." directed by Jeremy Coon and Tim Skousen revisits those tender years and what came after with a lot of obvious enthusiasm and not an ounce of critical distance as if they too were just two more friends playing along. This eagerness toward the adaptation is understandable given its ungainly charm but the problem is that the documentary isn���t strictly about the remake. Too much of the documentary is dedicated to the adult Mr. Zala and Mr. Strompolos who when it opens are in the midst of trying to raise money to shoot a complicated effects-heavy scene of ���Raiders of the Lost Ark��� that they didn���t pull off when they were teenagers."

That���s a testament to its lead actors who radiate tension and to the script adapted by Nikolaj Arcel from a novel by Jussi Adler-Olsen. Yes there are grisly scenes.

the movie also has lessons to impart. ���Nemo��� made the case for indomitability in the face of fear. ���Dory��� is more about the acceptance of chaos. Dory���s inability to make or stick to plans is shown in the long run to be an advantage. And her memory issues played mostly for laughs in the first movie take on a deeper meaning here. She and Nemo who was born with a deformed flipper are both people ��� well actually anthropomorphized fish but you know what I mean ��� with disabilities an identity shared by most of the new secondary characters." a little sad.  Running time:  1 hour 43 minutes." ���Finding Dory��� is a celebration of cognitive and physical differences. It argues with lovely ingenuity and understatement that what appear to be impairments might better be understood as strengths. The inclusiveness of the film���s vision is remarkable partly because it feels so natural something that no adult will really need to explain. Children will get it perhaps more intuitively and easily than the rest of us." for the most part a year after Nemo���s return to the reef ���Finding Dory��� flashes back to its heroine���s childhood when she was an adorable popeyed short-term-memory-challenged hatchling living with her mom (Diane Keaton) and dad (Eugene Levy). She wandered off one day and grew to adulthood looking for her family. The revival of this quest sends her across the seas and this time Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence) are the sidekicks." Dory conducts her search mostly in the confines of the Marine Life Institute an institution clearly inspired by the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California that the filmmakers turn into a theme park full of mechanical ingenuity and aquatic cuteness. There are toys and tots aquarium tanks and drain pipes strange birds and the disembodied voice of Sigourney Weaver. The plot like a theme-park ride is both predictable and exciting a fast-moving cascade of triumphs and setbacks punctuated with humor and pathos." ���Finding Dory��� is full of celebrity voice work including from a number of television performers. Kaitlin Olson of ���It���s Always Sunny in Philadelphia��� is a nearsighted shark. Idris Elba and Dominic West have a ���Wire��� reunion ��� Stringer Bell and McNulty together again! ��� as a pair of Cockney sea lions.

While it may not join the top tier of Pixar features ���Dory ��� directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane is certainly the best non-���Toy Story��� sequel the studio has produced. That may sound like faint praise given the startling mediocrity of ���Monsters University��� and ���Cars 2 ��� but what ���Dory��� lacks in dazzling originality it more than makes up for in warmth charm and good humor." Pixar���s place on the vanguard of animation is affirmed by ���Piper ��� the short directed by Alan Barillaro that accompanies ���Finding Dory��� in theaters. A variation on the themes of ���Nemo ��� it tells the simple touching story of a fledgling shore bird overcoming fear and facing danger. It also makes astonishing strides in the vivid and detailed rendering of feathers foam and sand.)" a wild-eyed loon flying with a bucket of angelfish in her beak and the other slapstick set pieces. And very few throats will remain unlumped as long-separated characters are reunited. Maybe there are a few too many reunions. How many times does Dory need to be found? But the repetitiveness of the story is related to its moral a Disney legacy reanimated by Pixar again and again. Solidarity and kinship are two sides of the same coin. ���Friends and family��� is a distinction without a difference." ��� Pixar���s 2003 masterpiece the ocean was a vast realm of menace and wonder newly charted by rapidly advancing digital-animation technology. The movie a visual revelation was also a welcome defense of risk-taking in an era of anxiety and something of a cautionary tale about the downsides of helicopter parenting. As often happens in adventure stories the hero was occasionally upstaged by his sidekick. We rooted for Nemo and choked up when he was found but the best lines and sweetest grace notes belonged to Dory the absent-minded blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres."

Beth B shows her mother���s work in some detail punctuating these views with shots of the artist who is now in her mid-80s archiving her work and speaking with gallerists. Sometimes she gets around with a cane or walker and sometimes she uses a scooter. In every other respect she gives no indication of frailty speaking in an emphatic voice and engaging colleagues with a fierce alertness." ��� a brief feature about the inventive provocative artist Ida Applebroog is less a documentary than a love letter.

you do need a little patience as this one builds slowly.

That investigation gets a shout-out at the beginning of this film but the real focus is their work in 1977 the year after they visited Amityville in the borough of Enfield in North London." Ms. Farmiga and Mr. Wilson again sell their characters pretty well and a youngster named Madison Wolfe makes quite an impression as Janet the child who absorbs the brunt of the poltergeist���s abuse.

other reviewers objected to the violence and sensationalism of his movies. Audience enthusiasm also ran hot and cold. There were big hits like ���Carrie ��� ���Dressed to Kill��� and ���The Untouchables ��� flops like ���Casualties of War ��� ���Bonfire of the Vanities��� and ���Mission to Mars.��� Most of his movies landed in the middle of the popularity bell curve but a surprising number have lingered in the popular imagination notably (and to the continued surprise of its director) ���Scarface.���" seamless action sequences and slow-building scenes of intimacy and brutality. So it seems only fitting that ���De Palma ��� an affectionate and absorbing documentary by Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow has the appearance of a single uninterrupted encounter between camera and subject. Mr. De Palma dressed in two layers of blue tells the story of his career with energy and good humor occasionally interrupted by clips from his own films and some by other directors that are relevant to his work." psychological perversity and visual bravura that characterize Mr. De Palma���s films can all plausibly be called Hitchcockian. But in ���De Palma ��� he discusses in roughly chronological order the full range of styles and genres he has explored. (For New Yorkers interested in sampling the fruits of that exploration the Metrograph in Lower Manhattan is hosting a monthlong retrospective with 35-millimeter prints of many of the films.)" ��� but his movies are full of sex gore and nudity.  Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes." ���De Palma��� proceeds quickly and nimbly through more than half a century of filmmaking naturally dwelling on the ���70s and ���80s Mr. De Palma���s hectic heroic decades. His candor and good humor keep things moving and it���s clear that he feels comfortable with his unseen unheard interlocutors who are colleagues as well as fans. Some Hollywood dirt is dished and a few personal matters are touched upon but the focus remains on the details of moviemaking as an art and a business." George Lucas Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese. Nostalgia for the New Hollywood may be old hat by now but Mr. De Palma���s recollections are so vivid and warm that ancient war stories seem fresh. It���s hard for even the most determinedly forward-looking film critic to suppress a twinge of generational envy. Forty years ago we would have been contemplating ���Carrie ��� ���Jaws��� and ���Taxi Driver ��� with the two ���Godfather��� movies in the rearview mirror and ���Star Wars��� on the horizon." ���De Palma��� will be catnip for passionate fans while also serving as a primer and a goad for the skeptical and the curious. Mr. De Palma is remarkable company ��� witty insightful and neither unduly modest nor overbearingly vain. It���s almost hard to believe that he could have made so many wild haunting and provocative movies but by the end of the documentary you may want nothing more than to see them all." as a student first at Columbia and then at Sarah Lawrence Mr. De Palma was drawn not to violence or suspense but to mischievous countercultural comedy. His collaborators included Jill Clayburgh William Finley and Robert De Niro who looks shockingly young in footage from ���The Wedding Party ��� the first feature Mr. De Palma completed." ��� which Mr. De Palma who is now 75 recalls seeing at a New York theater as a teenager. The Hitchcock-De Palma connection is not exactly news but the juxtaposition of images from both of their works and Mr. De Palma���s specific account of what he learned from the master go far beyond the usual glib critical shorthand. Mr. De Palma argues that Hitchcock���s general influence is overstated and that he himself is the only true heir among later generations of American filmmakers." as it has been for other directors and writers before and since. He holds no grudges ��� or at least not as many as you might expect ��� and counts himself lucky to have arrived at a time when the Hollywood system was perhaps uniquely open to risk-taking and personal expression."

a weary study in temperamental contrast. Tom blusters into Max���s office with a yawping Carolina drawl and a manuscript that has been rejected by nearly every other publishing house in New York. Max whose fedora has apparently been sewn on to his head and whose mouth is set into his face like an em-dash reads the thing on the train home. There mildly annoyed by the boisterous play of his many daughters and the amateur theatricals of his wife (Laura Linney) he settles into a closet to continue the manly labor of editing." it was Wolfe who laid windy claim to the titular epithet but history has been kinder to Perkins. A. Scott Berg���s Perkins biography which the film cites as its source is subtitled ���Editor of Genius ��� and the double meaning is clear enough. From his desk at Scribner���s Perkins helped shape the prose of among others F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway and in the process secured his own share of literary greatness. Those guys show up briefly onscreen impersonated by Guy Pearce (Fitzgerald) and Dominic West (Papa). Poor Zelda (Vanessa Kirby) also has a moment looking batty at the Perkinses��� dinner table in Connecticut." Mrs. Perkins mostly stays put except when she takes the girls away on vacation. More mercurial is Aline Bernstein (Nicole Kidman) a married theatrical set designer who has adopted Tom as her prot��g�� and appointed herself his muse.

The most egregious of these ��� in which Tom drags Max to a sweaty nightclub in Harlem pontificating on the spontaneous energies of jazz and boogieing with the working girls at the bar ��� adds a dash of racial condescension to the cocktail." Angel ��� a best seller and a magnet for critical acclaim at the time that survives mainly as a relic of bygone literary fashion. There is one scene in ���Genius��� that captures something of the work that went into transforming Wolfe���s graphomaniacal effusions into half-readable prose as Tom and Max amble through the city paring down an overwritten passage sentence by sentence. The rest of the film directed by Michael Grandage from a screenplay by John Logan depicts creation via furious montage. Tom stands at the refrigerator scribbling. Max jabs and plucks at pages of typescript. Bourbon and martinis are consumed. Cigarettes are smoked. Women come and go." it gives the buddy-movie treatment to that wild-man novelist Thomas Wolfe and his buttoned-up red-penciler Maxwell Perkins." ���Genius��� sighs with palpable nostalgia for a supposed golden age of masculine artistic potency and paints the struggle for self-expression in familiar sentimental colors. For Tom writing is the unbridled expression of the life force something Mr. Law indicates by hollering and gesticulating and allowing a stray lock of hair to fall just so across his brow. Mr. Firth���s performance is equally broad even though he���s supposed to be the more uptight partner in this bromance. He grimaces and sighs like a vaudeville Puritan."

I missed it much as I also missed the charm and periodic lightness of Tolkien���s world with its hobbits and Shire. ���Warcraft��� by contrast weighs in as a Hobbesian war of all against all though it does allow for a little romance and campy winks. It also more surprisingly offers some gray-shading notably with Durotan (Toby Kebbell) an orc chieftain with hands as big as Volkswagen Beetles and a pregnant mate Draka (Anna Galvin). He has qualms as well as enemies which surface amid battles and exposition. Stuff happens in one part of this world and other stuff happens elsewhere: Jaws clench bodies fall and scenes oscillate ��� ���twas ever thus genrewise." for starters the visual appeal of those Blutoesque beings lovingly fabricated and ornamented motion-capture creations who share their name with the creatures that J. R. R. Tolkien called orcs. Tolkien borrowed orc from the Old English citing ���Beowulf ��� one of the many tales of blood lust and vengeance heroes and monsters that are woven into the ���Warcraft��� DNA. The ruler here is King Llane (Dominic Cooper) a rather progressive monarch who fights the invading orcs with a multihued army a rakish aide-de-camp (Travis Fimmel) a token chick (Paula Patton) and a magical twosome (Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer)." though without any real shocks (or awe) but he also modestly complicates the question of the monstrous. The orcs in ���Warcraft��� prove somewhat more psychologically complex than any number of cartoon Hollywood villains ��� they���re sincere for one ��� and they���re generally better company than the king and his crew. It says something about Mr. Jones���s choices that he gives Durotan so much screen time and that Mr. Kebbell with the help of the special-effects wizards makes good use of that time with a nuanced moist-eyed turn that evokes old-studio gladiators like Victor Mature. Durotan is a beautiful brute and all the more human for it." despite the incessant clashing and clanging you can hear the tremulous pulse of a heartbeat. That faint thrumming belongs to Duncan Jones the director who against the odds has mined a watchable movie out of an entertainment franchise that started with a video game and now includes novels comics and assorted schlock (toys costumes a mah-jongg set). That Mr. Jones even factors into this production counts as some kind of actual achievement given that ���Warcraft��� is such an obvious bid at brand expansion which may be why no one bothered with an intelligible story.

If watching the big screen through a cannabis cloud isn���t your idea of a good movie time though I suggest that you do what I did and just go with the incoherent flow. You may not grasp who the Bluto-like creatures with simian arms and woolly mammoth tusks are or why they seem permanently engorged with rage.

Buried under makeup that leaves him looking like a renegade member of Blue Man Group he has no chance to display the charisma that made him such a vital component of ���Star Wars: The Force Awakens��� last year.

But as Mr. Wise and his colleagues explain their suit on behalf of the apes is not based on animal-welfare claims.

The legal team zeros in first on highly intelligent species like whales elephants and apes and then set out to find a venue settling on New York where several chimpanzees live in small rural zoos run-down amusement parks and university research laboratories. The chimps aren���t treated with intentional cruelty. The owners Mr. Wise encounters as he and his team conduct undercover investigations think they���re taking good care of their simian wards.

The subject of a cover article in The New York Times Magazine (its author Charles Siebert occasionally appears on camera) Mr. Wise has argued that animals should have the legal status of persons. What this means is not that they should be classified as human but rather that their rights should be acknowledged and protected under the law." together and separately made some of the most memorable documentaries of the past half-century ��� are inexhaustibly curious about people. They are driven to explore on a case-by-case basis what ticks us off and makes us tick and they have ranged far and wide across the contemporary landscape from battles over feminism in the 1970s to the 1992 presidential campaign to the cutthroat world of French pastry chefs." ��� Mr. Wise remarks near the end of the movie citing Winston Churchill and ���Unlocking the Cage��� is energized by the sense of recording an early chapter in a long history. Some of Mr. Wise���s positions may seem radically counterintuitive. How can a being without human language or human culture have standing to seek redress from human institutions? But it is also possible that practices and attitudes now widely taken as natural will look arbitrary and cruel to future generations and that the future will arrive sooner than many of us expect.

Mr. Minervini abandons Mark and returns to the men in camouflage who we learn are members of a paramilitary group. These fellows all veterans are apocalypse-minded bristling at a ���tyranny��� that they believe will soon be coming to confiscate their many many guns. In contrast to Mark and his fellows they are a more capable group insisting on casting themselves as dispossessed. Their coda to the movie is confounding and terrifying." which is largely set and shot in the poor Louisiana town of West Monroe we continue to follow Mark Kelley the initially naked man as he lives his life much of which is devoted to smoking crystal meth. He also makes the stuff in a very low-tech way ��� no ���Breaking Bad���-style chemistry sophistication here ��� and sells it and helps others consume it. One particularly harrowing scene shows him injecting it into the arm of a pregnant stripper in the bathroom of the club where she works. Mark has a girlfriend Lisa also an addict and various friends and relatives all of whose lives are in varying states of penury and decay." which lends the banality of Mark���s squalid realm a certain queasiness. He and his companions are acutely self-conscious about their societal status and in conversation they are quick to offer observations almost non sequiturs about prominent politicians replete with sexist and racist language. Soon after railing about President Obama���s self-centeredness Mark is seen injecting crystal meth into both of Lisa���s bare breasts which you suppose in his view is a form of service. For all that Mark is portrayed less as hateful than as hapless and possibly doomed." this film directed by Roberto Minervini is in fact something oddly different. To call it a cross between reality television and art film would perhaps be more accurate. Whatever genre it belongs to ���The Other Side��� is powerful and disturbing." verdant woodland. Camouflaged men (one or two blend into their surroundings so well that they are difficult to spot within the frame) stalk or crouch amid the trees and brush brandishing assault weapons.

Lee Bailey and Barry Scheck from Mr. Simpson���s defense team. Members of the Los Angeles Police Department (including the notorious Mark Fuhrman) are on hand as are African-American activists and clergymen from Los Angeles." ���trial of the century��� may have seemed a little over the top even as the television-watching public was transfixed by gavel-to-gavel coverage and hitherto obscure Los Angeles lawyers became household names. More than 20 years later though it sounds like an understatement. The trial of O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman touched every exposed nerve in the American body politic and forced Americans to confront matters we often prefer to cloak in euphemism and denial: racial division domestic violence the hyperactivity of the news media and the toxicity of celebrity culture." the contradictions exposed by the trial have been heightened. But for a long time the killings and Mr. Simpson���s acquittal lingered in a familiar kind of semi-oblivion a bizarre horrible episode we might remember but didn���t really want to think about. For people too young to have watched the proceedings in Judge Lance A. Ito���s courtroom unfold in real time the story had a fuzzy almost folkloric quality. A great football player might have stabbed two people to death. A jury decided otherwise. Kardashians were somehow involved. Weird." either by coincidence or by through the inscrutable workings of the spirit of the times the story is being retold not once but twice both times with impressive clarity and seriousness. ���The People v. O. J. Simpson ��� Ryan Murphy���s extraordinary installment in the ���American Crime Story��� anthology on FX which had its premiere in February focused on the trial itself and on the constellation of characters brought together by the defendant. Mr. Simpson himself though capably played by Cuba Gooding Jr. was a bit of a cipher less the protagonist of the drama than its structuring absence. The series was pretty sure about what he did but it never quite figured out who he was." for that matter as a famous man exposed to the glare of nonstop media attention ��� O. J. Simpson is viewed as a symbol. His unique experience is a lens onto something larger and his fate carries political significance. Nicole Brown Simpson���s fate in contrast is treated as an individual tragedy and there seems to be no political vocabulary available to the filmmakers to understand what happened to her. The deep links between misogyny and American sports culture remain unexamined." and it seems to have been exceeded by his charm. Friends and teammates testify to his generosity his charisma and his shrewd ability to foster and profit from his image as an all-around good sport. He was one of the first black athletes to succeed nationally in advertising most notably as the face of Hertz running through airports to cries of ���Go O.J. Go!��� He also distanced himself from the racial politics of the 1960s and ���70s in striking and deliberate contrast to athletes like Muhammad Ali Bill Russell and Jim Brown. ���I���m not black. I���m O.J. ��� he liked to say. The sportswriter Robert Lipsyte describes Mr. Simpson as a ���counterrevolutionary ��� and in Brentwood he assimilated easily into the white elite." bringing in the voices of journalists writers and ordinary residents of Los Angeles who relate a sorry chronicle of discrimination and abuse. This narrative is entwined with the more upbeat tale of Mr. Simpson���s earlier life. Viewers are reminded that he was an amazing football player one of the most brilliant running backs ever to play the game. The first chapter of the documentary follows his rise from the Potrero Hill housing project in San Francisco to the campus of the University of Southern California and then to a professional career with the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers." ��� a staggering five-part nearly eight-hour installment in ESPN���s ambitious and innovative ���30 for 30��� documentary series which is also being released in an extended format in theaters goes a long way toward filling in that blank. Though dominated by the trial it extends the narrative in both directions producing a detailed biography of Mr. Simpson that is also a social history of race fame sports and Los Angeles over the past half-century. ���The People v. O. J. Simpson��� was a tightly packed almost indecently entertaining piece of pop realism a Dreiser novel infused with the spirit of Tom Wolfe. For its part ���O.J.: Made in America ��� directed by Ezra Edelman has the grandeur and authority of the best long-form nonfiction. If it were a book it could sit on the shelf alongside ���The Executioner���s Song��� by Norman Mailer and the great biographical works of Robert Caro." and Mr. Edelman brings to light intriguing facts about Mr. Simpson without leaning too hard on their possible significance. He cheated at golf. His father was gay. He was loyal to his teammates and unfaithful to his wife." candid and self-serving but the film���s purpose is less to relitigate past events than to make sense of them. The shadow of Rodney King ��� his videotaped beating by L.A.P.D. officers their acquittal and the subsequent riots ��� hangs over the Simpson trial but so does a much longer history of racism and brutality. The jury���s verdict which struck many white observers at the time as inexplicable is situated against a background of longstanding resentment and mistrust that the prosecution misjudged and the defense successfully exploited." though a feat of tireless research dogged interviewing and skillful editing. Some of the images have an uncanny familiarity while others land with almost revelatory force. It was a little unnerving to watch courtroom scenes re-enacted by the cast of the FX mini-series and the strangeness is redoubled by the return of the originals as they were then and as they are now." there are gaps in the record and holes in the interpretive framework the film constructs around it. It is hard not to notice the predominance of male voices among the interview subjects and the narrowness of the film���s discussion of domestic violence. This is not to say that the issue is ignored: Mr. Simpson���s history of abusing Nicole is extensively and graphically documented as is the fact that most of his friends ignored what was going on at their Rockingham estate. But the film which so persuasively treats law enforcement racism as a systemic problem can���t figure out how to treat violence against women with the same kind of rigor or nuance." but I want to emphasize that ���O.J.: Made in America��� sees a great deal very clearly and does not flinch from what it sees. The last episode which shows what happened to Mr. Simpson after the verdict is in a way the most wrenching and upsetting part of the film. The trial as tawdry and tabloidesque as it often was had a certain gravity a moral seriousness that to some extent justified and mitigated the spectacle. The subsequent chapter which ends in the Nevada prison where Mr. Simpson currently resides is all entropy squalor and sleaze. Having traced every step of his journey in detail over eight hours you still find yourself wondering what the hell happened to this guy. He was made in America and unmade here too."

In an earlier incarnation shown at film festivals much of the dialogue was hard to discern because of the thick Scottish brogues.

All it takes to be transported from hell into a spiritual retreat is the sound of a romantic popular song on the radio that seems to emanate from heaven and that conjures a poignant yearning." which nudge forward a slow-moving story rife with everyday tragedy. The scenes of harvesting wheat with primitive equipment and caring for farm animals in a turbulent climate are a continual reminder that despite its beauty life here is no idyll and the rural community���s strict Puritanism frowns on frivolity and idle pleasure." a bright hard-working Scottish farm girl in Terence Davies���s film ���Sunset Song��� fuse into a luminous vision of the land and the people tending it.

Frederica has caught the eye of Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett) described in an onscreen note (and later aloud) as ���a bit of a rattle ��� which is Regency slang for blithering idiot. Visiting the estate of her sister- and brother-in-law (Emma Greenwell and Justin Edwards) Susan meets a dreamboat named Reginald (Xavier Samuel) who is both her perfect match and a wildly inappropriate choice." little-known epistolary novella called ���Lady Susan ��� ���Love & Friendship��� is a reminder that Austen was not only a brilliant architect of screen-friendly plots but also a very funny writer. Mr. Stillman���s script accordingly abounds in rapid-fire sallies of verbal wit that require and reward maximum alertness. There is plenty of low comedy as well a bracing silliness that places Austen in the line of British humor that extends through P. G. Wodehouse to Monty Python. The lavish costumes and lovely real estate ��� requirements of the genre ��� are offset by a fizzy giddy mood of spirited preposterousness." and in the shadings Ms. Beckinsale gives to Susan who is at once heroine and villainess.

He approaches his literary source not with the usual reverence but with an appreciation for its freewheeling sense of fun. At times most often when Mr. Bennett is onscreen ���Love & Friendship��� is howlingly funny and as a whole it feels less like a romance than like a caper an unabashedly contrived and effortlessly inventive heist movie with a pretty good payoff." the story more or less takes care of itself as the action shuttles between London and various country houses. Callers are received letters are opened gossip is breathlessly exchanged and long walks are taken on beautifully manicured lawns. Reputations are at stake along with innocent hearts and large sums of money. It all ends up pretty much as expected and yet also manages to take you by surprise." desire and fortune-hunting zips along propelled by Lady Susan Vernon a charmer and schemer played with verve and precision by Kate Beckinsale. A less than grief-stricken widow Susan has the kind of amoral poise that might make her a suitable alpha on ���Real Housewives of the Home Counties��� circa 1800. Her smile is as radiant as her motives are murky and she leaves a trail of wreckage and confusion in her wake." there have been too many Jane Austen movies and too few Whit Stillman movies. I refrained from starting that sentence with ���It is a truth universally acknowledged ��� because it isn���t and also because that would have been too obvious a way of calling attention to the Austen glut and its attendant clich��s. I���m happy to report in any case that the release of ���Love & Friendship��� mitigates both the shortage and the surfeit. It���s the Whit Stillman movie that some of us have been waiting a long time for and also a Jane Austen movie that goes some way toward correcting the record of dull and dutiful cinematic Janeism."

The movie so upends the traditions of documentary and narrative filmmaking that ���dramatizes��� may be inaccurate ��� the filmmakers followed the real pilgrims for a full year after all. But the movie is so well made and engaging that such distinctions will make little difference to the viewer." especially when the 11 pilgrims who set out for Lhasa and its Jokhang Temple the most revered site in Tibetan Buddhism are purposefully falling to the ground every few steps.

It���s an aggressively literal-minded movie set in a world where metaphors are all but banished and dreams and fantasies are drab and desperate affairs. The patrons of the hotel would be ridiculous if they were not so miserable and vice versa. They are in every sense disenchanted." the regimen of meals and activities is fairly straightforward. Behaviors are closely monitored transgressions (notably masturbation) are punished and desultory sexual relief is provided by the staff (notably a maid played by Ariane Labed).

Whether such compatibility can be faked is a central dramatic question. David and Mr. Whishaw���s character both try with varying degrees of success. Mr. Reilly���s has a harder time." the loners practice guerrilla warfare and declare their opposition to the sexual regulation and tyrannical monogamy represented by the hotel. Their leader (L��a Seydoux) tells new recruits that they can masturbate whenever they want. But as is so often true of revolutionary movements this army of freedom fighters mirrors the dominant society in its capacity for brutality and coercion. Any kind of romantic or erotic attachment is forbidden and disciplinary methods range from comical to horrific." an inventor of absurd highly regulated societies that seem to exist in hidden pockets of everyday reality. In his 2010 film ���Dogtooth ��� a middle-class couple raises three children according to an elaborate set of codes and rituals that include assigning new meanings to common words.

Happiness appears to be a state of dead-eyed consumerist ease illuminated by an occasional wan flicker of mirth or dread." misanthropic vision with emotional gravity and grace. Mr. Farrell a habitual over-actor is especially affecting because you can sense his effort to restrain himself.

Eventually the two men meet (the architect is played by Jeremy Irons who could be Mr. Hiddleston���s Dorian Gray hologram). The building part of a projected complex was meant to be an incubator for social change but it has devolved into a paranoid class-ridden microcosm of social dysfunction.

It���s not so much a grand science-fiction saga or even a series of action-adventure movies as a very expensive perpetually renewed workplace sitcom." in which two teams of costumed co-workers with a few ringers in the mix face off to work out their issues. The battle is entertaining precisely because the stakes are relatively low. No planets cities or galaxies are in peril and you can enjoy the spectacle without any of the usual action-movie queasiness about invisible and extensive civilian casualties. (Someone will have to clean up the mess of course but that just means overtime for the maintenance workers who may even be unionized). And there is a solid satisfying physicality to the effects.

A few years ago the luxury-goods company Christian Dior recycled images of that film���s heartthrob attraction Alain Delon in an ad campaign for its cologne Eau Sauvage that used the Rolling Stones��� ���Sympathy for the Devil.��� The playlist for ���A Bigger Splash��� includes a couple of Stones songs as well notably ���Emotional Rescue ��� which is in rotation with Harry Nilsson Giuseppe Verdi 1970s Brazilian classics and Hollywood���s eternal bad boy Robert Mitchum murdering the calypso ditty ���Beauty Is Only Skin Deep.���" she was suffering under the Milanese sun in ���I Am Love ��� playing an unhappy wife fluttering in a gilded cage.

They���re a delectable pair of sexy beasts ensconced on a jaw-slackening compound on Pantelleria a volcanic island in the strait of Sicily that���s within viewing distance of Tunisia. Marianne has recently had career-lengthening throat surgery a procedure that���s rendered her near-speechless." Mr. Guadagnino makes a more convincing political case when he just lets his characters meander and do what they do best which is living idly fabulously. You could read an entire history of civilization and capitalism in how Marianne drapes her legs across a lounger or strides into a humble Italian home to sample some homemade ricotta. Ms. Swinton conveys casual entitlement like someone to the manner born which gives Marianne���s teasing exchanges with Harry an increasingly discomfiting quality. Harry has come to the island for something he feverishly wants and believes he needs. He���s a man on a desperate mission one that Mr. Fiennes with a wildly flapping mouth and manic limbs turns into a raw indelible portrait of loss." only naughtier and far nastier.

Every fetishized element ��� the glorious house the tiled pool Marianne���s Dior outfits and the scrubbiest of vistas ��� looks ravishing ready for a close-up too. The world that Mr. Guadagnino creates is at once seductive and aspirational and another reminder that movies have always excelled at stoking consumer desires. Much like Nancy Meyers (���The Intern���) Mr. Guadagnino excels at creating lifestyle pornography of an especially rarefied kind although in classic European style he gilds the pleasure with some political guilt." ��� an Italian come-on that doesn���t just want to amuse you but also to pour you a Negroni before taking you for a midnight spin with the top down. Set on an Italian island slithering with snakes and beautiful people the movie is something of a reluctant thriller about a rock star her current lover her former lover and a pretty young thing. Bad things happen because you know life is pain ��� in the meantime though do enjoy the magnificent digs the designer threads and the frolicking nude stars." Ms. Swinton has always looked ready for her close-up with D. W. Griffith; few contemporary movie actresses can hold you with their gaze as effortlessly as she does. Marianne���s radio silence is a storytelling contrivance (for personal reasons Ms. Swinton agreed to appear in the movie if she didn���t speak) but it adds to the character���s celebrity aura and deepens the sense of isolation conveyed by the location. And while Marianne whispers when she feels like it her relative silence works both for Ms. Swinton ��� it draws you closer to her ��� and for Mr. Guadagnino a voluptuary who revels in the surface beauty of the natural and unnatural worlds." mind you just enough to give the whole thing a patina of seriousness. Much like the faded hammer-and-sickle tattoo embellishing Harry���s oft-bared chest the movie���s politics come across as self-consciously ornamental. At times as with the topical references to refugees (a few of whom are seen huddled in detention) these glimpses of the larger agonizing world are clearly meant to say something about the characters and their insularity. Mr. Guadagnino may be actually trying to assuage his conscience (or ours) as if to do penance for all this careless opulence. Yet these moments register as ritualistic at best opportunistic at worst and you wish he wouldn���t even bother."

��� American cruise ships have yet to drop anchor again in Havana Harbor. That���s the strength and appeal of this modestly scaled movie which was written and directed by Ben Chace an American who shot in Cuba before its new diplomatic relationship with the United States had taken root. The Cuba here is still the time capsule stocked with DeSoto cruisers a crumbled infrastructure and paperwork filled out by hand. For Luis (Carlos Padr�_n who���s Cuban like the rest of the cast) memory itself is another time capsule one that he gradually somewhat disjointedly opens after reading about the death of an old lover a dancer Isabela (Yulisleyv�_s Rodriguez)." and together director and actor create a portrayal of a man who even as he���s stirred to action seems increasingly burdened by his sentimental education. Mr. Chace���s attempts to piece together Luis���s present and past tend to obscure rather than clarify that portrait; even so Luis and especially Havana hold your attention. The movie was inspired by the Jorge Luis Borges���s short story ���The Zahir ��� about an item (a coin in the story) that instills an obsession in all who come into contact with it. For Luis Isabela was an obsession who dazzled him and consumed him and finally like so many ideals become impossible to hold onto." and runs 1 hour 24 minutes." ���Sin Alas��� follows Luis as he becomes reacquainted with his younger self both as a young man (Lieter Ledesma) in 1967 and as a child living with his parents. Mr. Chace working with a small crew that includes the talented cinematographer Sean Price Williams persuasively recreates a vision of an earlier Havana filled with glamorous true believers menacing military men and cocktail chatter about revolutionary aesthetics. When Luis picks up Isabela one rainy afternoon the antiqued scene vaguely suggests the nostalgic reveries of Wong Kar Wai even with the poster of a gun-toting Fidel Castro marking the 1959 overthrow of Batista���s Cuba." the old man in the quiet drama ���Sin Alas��� opens a little folding table outside his splendidly dilapidated grand building. A writer who lived and loved through the Cuban Revolution Luis Vargas now sells bric-a-brac that no one seems to buy. Stooped and faded his white mustache drooping over his downturned mouth he looks out on a Havana that���s teeming with compa��eros and trembling with signs of upheaval that are telegraphed by newspaper headlines highlighting China in one column and President Obama in the other.

Annie and Baxter keep their physical distance from their parents. But the ties that bind body and soul are hard to cut and the siblings are still playing supporting roles and still not in control of their lives. Annie is an actress seemingly on a downward spiral who while shooting a movie is resisting pressure to appear topless. Baxter is trying and failing to finish a second novel. Reluctantly he takes a magazine assignment to write about war veterans a gig that leads to a drunken woodsy bacchanal with potato guns and lands him in a hospital with a head injury." domineering father who���s oblivious to the nervously accommodating mother and the exasperated haplessly stuck adult children. Mr. Bateman���s direction of the actors is especially sensitive in this and other tricky scenes showing a delicacy with emotional textures that isn���t always matched by the story especially when Annie and Baxter speak in therapeutic clich��s. Thankfully most of these spill out late after the story has jumped around in time toggling between the present and flashbacks to Caleb and Camille���s happenings (Jason Butler Harner and Kathryn Hahn play the younger versions). Those scenes expose the dangers of their performances but also the thrill. The tragedy isn���t that Caleb and Camille can���t tell the difference between art and life but that they could make only one seem important."

when Eva Hesse went to Germany on a fellowship with her husband the sculptor Tom Doyle she was a talented 28-year-old painter with a blue-chip education (Cooper Union and Yale) and a foothold in the art world. By the time of her death six years later from brain cancer she was widely recognized as a major artist a maker of category-confounding forms ��� abstract and visceral minimalist and feminist sculptural and painterly ��� that have lost none of their power in the decades since." mostly dressed in 21st-century studio or academic mufti. Hesse in contrast is a revenant from a cooler smokier scruffier decade eternally and intriguingly youthful. At times resembling the actress Dakota Johnson she appears mainly in black-and-white still photographs some of which are digitally massaged so that they seem to move ever so slightly. Her voice is heard once in a snippet of audiotape. But Ms. Begleiter has made ample and judicious use of Hesse���s letters and diaries passages of which are read in voice-over by Selma Blair. These selections along with the pictures create a powerful illusion of immediacy a sense of the personality disclosed and obscured by the art." but many of their relatives were killed during World War II and the girls��� mother committed suicide in 1946. Though the Holocaust was never an overt theme in Hesse���s work Ms. Begleiter traces the shadow it cast on her life especially during her sojourn in Germany with Mr. Doyle." Hesse veered from heroic confidence to crippling doubt but in every phase she seemed capable of remarkable clarity humor and warmth. Among her closest confidants was Sol LeWitt the scholarly sphinxlike Conceptualist visionary who was the subject of an excellent documentary by Chris Teerink a few years ago. Their correspondence is clearly a remarkable trove of art world gossip fraternal feeling and critical insight and it provides this film its emotional and intellectual grounding. (LeWitt���s parts are read by the actor Patrick Kennedy.) But the drama of ���Eva Hesse��� is a story of mastery and self-discovery of a woman asserting her autonomy in a male-dominated professional realm." and it conveys a vivid sense of the sexual politics of the New York art world in the 1960s a scene still dominated by the myth of the heroic male creator. Hesse���s response was to cultivate her own heroism a powerfully idiosyncratic style that could be earthy delicate whimsical and sublime sometimes all at once. ���Eva Hesse��� pays a gratifying amount of attention to the thinking and the techniques that produced her art and invites viewers to contemplate it further. It���s like a comprehensive exhibition catalog or a thorough critical essay ��� an indispensable aid to understanding and appreciating a fascinating artist." ��� Marcie Begleiter���s conscientious and moving documentary tells the full story of its subject���s tragically foreshortened life but it focuses on those years of artistic emergence a period of rapid development and furious productivity with few parallels in the history of art. Hesse herself is both a ubiquitous presence in the film and something of a specter ��� an animating spirit and a ghost haunting the frames. She is remembered by friends colleagues and her sister Helen Hesse Charash. Her work is analyzed by curators and critics. Mr. Doyle is on hand to reflect tactfully and ruefully on the ups and downs of their relationship."

But that���s what Mr. Hanks accomplishes in the German filmmaker Tom Tykwer���s easygoing screen adaptation of Dave Eggers���s novel ���A Hologram for the King.��� This fanciful tale about Alan Clay an American consultant visiting Saudi Arabia to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government has been transformed through the force of Mr. Hanks���s nice-guy personality.

in truth with some family melodrama and sweet romance thrown in. Affable earnest and humanly scaled ���The Meddler��� is the kind of entertainment that the studios used to supply by the boatload and that now tends to show up on the small screen.

The patter is inane funny lifelike and Ms. Sarandon���s Jersey intonations give it a comic topspin. Ms. Scafaria seeds these passages with information ��� Marnie���s dead husband Joe was the love of her life ��� and you can see the narrative machinery in action. But part of what makes the movie work is its unshowy realism including yammer that isn���t the stuff of dramatic setup or tension but instead resembles the churn of random observations and pointless asides.

Still there is work to be done a life to live and in a sense the movie is a coming-of-later-age story in which a mother learns how to cut the cord one funny poignant snip at a time and discovers herself in the process. In this Marnie receives help from a much younger mother Jillian (Cecily Strong) and a new friend Zipper (J.K. Simmons) who each peel back layers." ��� you may wish it were the last. One half of an insistently winning hopelessly irresistible mother-daughter duet this buttinsky New Jersey widow (Susan Sarandon) puts the ���awl��� into call and the ���awk��� into talk and works both your nerves and ears as she does.

Part of this is the quality of the Los Angeles light which here has none of its sunshine-and-noir harshness but instead gives the characters an appealing glow a glow that after a while feels like adoration. When Marnie looks at Lori ��� and Lori looks at Marnie ��� you are watching two people who despite the nonsense care for each other deeply. You see their happiness and you share in it too because in ���The Meddler��� Ms. Scafaria is holding up that softening filter through which each of us sees the funny maddening indispensable people with whom we laugh mourn and if we���re lucky find love." leaving her mom alone. Marnie copes with this separation in her usual fashion calling Lori amid visits to the mall (cue the Crate & Barrel product placements) and visits to Lori���s dogs Lori���s friends and Lori���s shrink. Marnie has started to see the therapist (Amy Landecker in a quick deadpan turn) at Lori���s urging though mostly she seems to go as a way to insinuate herself even more deeply into her daughter���s life. It���s no wonder that Marnie seems like a smother-mother who���s one 911 call away from a restraining order; no wonder too that she seems lonely." despite the melancholy edging its comedy. Marnie is the biggest source of the humor and Ms. Sarandon plays her beautifully in every shade of sunshine.

Both the 1967 and 2016 Mowglis by contrast live under the Law of Disney which dictates that humans can exist with nature as long as nature isn���t too wild. There���s an argument to be made against that kind of cuddly domination of nature. Yet it���s also true that generations have grown up loving and respecting animals (as animals not just human surrogates) because of the peaceable kingdom that Disney has created. Here���s hoping that next time Mowgli shows up onscreen he trades in his four-legged foe for some two-legged villains ��� before the only wild worlds we have left are computer-generated." fearing potential trouble with the N.A.A.C.P. For all the ostensible timelessness of its storytelling Disney has always made movies that speak to its audiences and the world they live in. Even so it���s hard not to squirm through the number with Prima���s scatting ape because of the troubling signifiers it throws out. At the same time the film partly alleviates however unwittingly Rudyard Kipling���s weighty colonialist baggage both by giving Mowgli an Indian child a golly-gee American voice and by casting George Sanders as the villainous tiger Shere Khan who sounds just as you would expect a world-weary British royal to sound after centuries of pillaging. So a mixed Disney bag as usual with a hippie kid confusing politics and fuzzy-wuzzies." though there���s scarcely anything alive in it. That goes for the gaudy and glorious flora the gathering clouds and the wind stirring them all of which were created with various degrees of believability via computers. The child playing Mowgli ��� the human orphan turned wolf child ��� is played by an actual kid who frolics with computer-generated critters a smart call given that animals can be tricky to work with and that some of this menagerie���s real-life equivalents are (sorry to be a bummer) endangered." but now he���s lethally instead of imperiously cool which seems unfair given that Bengal tigers are endangered. The rest of the adult animals meanwhile largely register as noble particularly the elephants that Bagheera and Mowgli bow down before. In the 1967 film the elephants are amusingly buffoonish and march in a pachyderm parade as their leader invokes his time with the maharajah. The 2016 movie doesn���t refer directly to our environmental catastrophes including the decimation of the elephant population. Yet when Bagheera now instructs Mowgli to bow before the elephants it feels as if the filmmakers were gesturing to the truth that this fantasy and its relation to the real world are now tragically different from what they were in Kipling���s time." there���s a suggestion that humans can play their part in their rescue which is a comforting moral for the children who are this movie���s main audience. At the same time it would be heartening if Disney took a more environmentally aware stance in the sequel that���s already been discussed especially given that the company���s brand owes as much to the natural world as to princesses. In recent years the Disney princess has undergone a radical makeover evolving into a can-do figure who exists in that cinematic sweet spot between her fantastical world and our real one. The studio���s animal kingdom could use a comparable makeover."

A late sequence involving an encounter with Melanie and a high school drinking party is the one part of the film that breathes with a sense of freedom and spontaneity.

it���s another rung on Ms. McCarthy���s big ladder up. It���s a fitful amalgam of bouncy and slack laughs mixed in with some blasts of pure physical comedy and loads of yammering heads. There isn���t much filmmaking in it outside of Ms. McCarthy���s precision comedic timing and natural screen presence. But as it turns out sometimes it���s pleasurable enough just watching the most unlikely American comedy star since Bill Murray slip into a groove. Part of a sorority that is redefining what funny means in movies Ms. McCarthy is proving that women can be comedy���s font not just the killjoy who shuts off the tap." some of them very funny cuts to the appeal of a goof like ���The Boss ��� which even at its most familiar feels different because of who���s inspiring the laughter and jostling those breasts. Given this it���s worth remembering that slipped among the jokes is a story about two women who struggle with separate existential and economic realities and thrive in mutual dependency. In its arc the story recalls the 1933 Fannie Hurst novel ���Imitation of Life��� (and its filmed adaptations) about a white woman who makes a fortune off her black female employee���s recipes and likeness. ���The Boss��� dodges race and puts a smiley face on greed but it���s hard not to think that in celebrating female self-reliance Ms. McCarthy ��� star writer producer ��� is saying a little something about women in the entertainment industry." ���The Boss ��� Melissa McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell an investment guru with a motivational racket along the inspirational lines of Tony Robbins and Suze Orman. Wildly successful Michelle fills stadiums with true believers who drink her snake oil by the tanker cheering as she preaches the gospel of personal riches and the power of you you you even if it���s really all about her her her. She���s peddling empowerment of a kind as is this movie gleefully silly froth that Ms. McCarthy sells with slapstick you-go-girl uplift and a Kewpie doll smile that���s one twitch short of pure madness." an enterprise that leads her to recruit members of a girl-scout-like troop and engage in corporate warfare with an amorous foe (Peter Dinklage). Along the way Ms. McCarthy runs amusingly at times dementedly away with the movie as when Michelle while offering lingerie advice plays with Claire���s (clothed) breasts. In its intimate physicality this bit suggests a delightfully weird riff on a slap-happy Three Stooges exchange. Except that instead of smacking each other���s faces Michelle and Claire are reveling in the comedy of the female breast a routine that metaphorically whips the lacy push-up bra off what is of course an ordinary body part." ���Tammy��� touches on economic struggles that both connect it to the real world and suggest that Ms. McCarthy has ambitions beyond the well-executed pratfall. On its glossy surface ���The Boss��� looks safer than ���Tammy ��� partly because Michelle registers as a more familiar sellable caricature: the 1 percent meanie who needs a Tiny Tim to administer some emotional CPR. Michelle is plenty self-fulfilled when the story opens at least professionally as telegraphed by her bombast and an office stuffed with her framed portrait. She has issues but money is just the gold that���s plating her wounded self (or something)." ��� though I like to think that the director Paul Feig (���Spy���) might one day deliver on that dream. Until then she will continue to split sides and make bank including in disposable enjoyable nonsense like ���The Boss.��� It���s the second movie that she���s starred in directed by her husband Ben Falcone following the 2014 ���Tammy ��� about a sad sack who after losing her job sets off on a two-track inner and outer journey. That did well enough at the box office ��� Ms. McCarthy has become a Teflon laugh factory ��� despite being unworthy of her talents and despite the uneasy unfunny jokes about Tammy burgers and doughnuts." Mr. Falcone and Steve Mallory the movie tracks Michelle as she goes from penthouse to prison followed by a life-changing stay with her wary former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell an appealing second banana) a single mom with a kid (Ella Anderson). There in their cramped apartment mother and daughter coax out Michelle���s inner softy who unsurprisingly is nowhere near as fun as her outer meanie. Mae West once cracked ���Don���t marry a man to reform him ��� that���s what reform schools are for.��� The same tends to be true about writing characters."

Though later research has suggested that Arendt misjudged Eichmann ��� who was for one thing a much more ardent anti-Semite than he seemed to be sitting in the dock ��� the idea that great horror can spring from mundane roots has proved tenacious and perpetually relevant." ��� a vigorous and thoughtful new documentary by Ada Ushpiz frames its inquiry into Arendt���s career with her encounter with Eichmann. But its focus is much wider than the still-potent debate over ���Eichmann in Jerusalem ��� which was widely and fiercely attacked for what critics took to be its trivialization of Eichmann���s deeds and its lack of sympathy for his victims. Though both Arendt���s defenders and detractors are heard from Ms. Ushpiz���s film situates the Eichmann episode within a broad and rich portrait of an intellectual determined to use the tools of rationality to comprehend historical events that seem to defy all reason." and ���Vita Activa��� includes some especially chilling implications for the current state of American politics. Totalitarianism rested in Arendt���s view above all on the systematic refusal to engage reality on the substitution of ideological fantasy and outright fiction for reason and empiricism. To risk understatement those tendencies have hardly disappeared from modern society and may even be stronger than they were at the end of Arendt���s life."

For the most part Ms. Akerman simply records her mother in this apartment fuss-budgeting about while murmuring to herself or talking to visitors like Ms. Akerman whose camera often sits on a surface like another household appliance (which it is). The conversations between mother and daughter span the continuum from light to dark present to past from the young Chantal���s untied shoelaces to the Holocaust. Sometimes mother and daughter talk via Skype and you can see Ms. Akerman who often seems to be calling from a new location pointing her camera at her laptop her tiny image in the window that lets each caller see how she looks to the other." apparently a suicide at 65. One of the most influential filmmakers of the past several decades she leaves behind two-dozen features including ���No Home Movie ��� which serves as a conceptual and emotional counterpoint to her early masterwork ���Jeanne Dielman 23 Quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles��� (1975) which she made when she was 25. Her death makes ���No Home Movie��� even more of a memento mori than perhaps it might have seemed when she finished it given her mother���s impending death. Yet this makes the movie sound far too bleak especially in light of the love ��� the love that Ms. Akerman has for her mother who returns it in kind ��� that suffuses it." ��� Ms. Akerman cuts to a succession of traveling shots of a desert. They cleave the movie in two. There���s no overt explanation for them; there���s no voice-over commentary and none of the traditional documentary time date and location markers. Again as she does with the image of the shuddering tree Ms. Akerman lets you read the image for yourself even as she has also carefully laid out the movie���s meaning in every previous edit shot and word including her mother���s remembrances of the family���s history about keeping kosher about the flight from Poland the Nazis and the war. In your head these mother-daughter conversations ��� ���We thought we were safe here in Belgium ��� Natalia says at one point ��� become one with the thrashing desert wind." half-bare branches shuddering violently in the wind.

Like the rest of the movie they have the spontaneity and ineffable fascination of real life; it feels as if Ms. Akerman had turned on the camera seconds before she and her mother began talking. In time though her mother grows increasingly frail they also assume an undertow of sadness. Ms. Akerman���s filmography which sent her across the globe from the Baltics to Mexico has turned her into one of cinema���s nomads as have the festivals (Berlin Cannes New York) in which her work has been presented. There���s a rootlessness to her as even her meanderings through her mother���s apartment suggest." with English subtitles.

That���s true of ���Jeanne Dielman ��� an unblinking three-and-a-half-hour look at an outwardly impassive Belgian homemaker (Delphine Seyrig) who turns tricks in her immaculate sterile apartment amid other quotidian activities like folding sheets and making a meatloaf for more than three deliberate minutes." sparsely furnished room with a single window she doesn���t say anything. She just ties her shoes draws the curtains and exits letting the shot linger on the empty room. Her mother Natalia has been failing and Ms. Akerman���s melancholy hangs over the scene like funeral crepe. The first time I watched it her heavy silence was painful to see; the second time watching had turned into raw feeling because Ms. Akerman is now gone." ���No Home Movie��� invites you in first with its intimacy and then its deep feeling. It���s filled with Ms. Akerman���s signatures like images of doorways halls and obliquely shot rooms which can make her seem like a spy in her mother���s house. This is not as the title reminds you a home movie in the usual sense and yet it is. The deaths haunting it as well as some of its themes ��� the Holocaust the Jewish diaspora that far-off desert and the refuge we find in another���s embrace ��� can make it unbearably sad. The moment that I keep returning to occurs during a Skype talk when Ms. Akerman shows her reflection in her laptop screen her face floating over her mother���s like a ghost. She���s away yet she also feels home." ���Jeanne Dielman��� has often been discussed within a theoretical and political framework (voyeurism the male gaze) that can feel as mechanical as a 101 intro to cinema studies. With its long takes silences and emphasis on the kinds of everyday moments that most movies tend to ignore the film isn���t obviously inviting perhaps particularly for viewers whose rhythms are calibrated to those of dominant cinema and its three acts ping-pinging shots and counter-shots inciting incidents and tidy ends. You need to meet Ms. Akerman on her terms although even when you do her work may not completely open itself up to you even after repeated viewings. Its difficulty (or mystery) which can feel like her stubborn persistence of vision is part of its pleasure."

In addition to Keaton there was Boris Kaufman an important cinematographer and the younger brother of the great Soviet director and documentarian Dziga Vertov. Mr. Lipman makes much of that connection and threads ���Notfilm��� with lovely clips from Vertov���s films and other silent treasures." contrasting images of haplessness and stoicism. Beckett���s deeply lined visage surmounted by a sweep of silver hair is an emblem of late modernism a quietly charismatic mask of weary resolve in the face of existential absurdity. Keaton���s smooth brow and melancholy deadpan customarily shadowed by a porkpie hat express an ingenious innocent determination to surmount whatever obstacles the universe imposes." for one thing. It also evokes ���Not I ��� the fevered monologue ��� delivered by a disembodied mouth ��� that is numbered among Beckett���s theatrical masterpieces. And there is more than a hint of Beckettian self-reference since Mr. Lipman���s project motivated partly by his work as a preservationist is very much an artifact of the digital age. A charming earnest sometimes ungainly mixture of history criticism and high-minded gossip ���Notfilm��� testifies to an almost inexhaustible fascination with the pleasures and paradoxes of cinema." and that pushes against the constraints of the ���making of��� documentary template. Mr. Lipman has much to say about the making and transmission of moving images about the role of the movie camera in modern life and about the philosophical underpinnings of Beckett���s literary and theatrical vision. At times you may wish he had absorbed some of Beckett���s ��� or Keaton���s ��� ferocious discipline. Both of them were masters of pared-down precision and elegant understatement. Mr. Lipman���s sensibility by contrast is expansive and digressive attracted to loftiness and sweep." by the ways various recording machines both assuage and intensify the alienation of modern life. Extracts from Keaton���s work in particular ���The Cameraman ��� suggest that he had similar interests though he was always more concerned with technique than theory and did not think much of Beckett or ���Film.��� All the same Keaton���s performance in it is full of pathos and professionalism as is ���Notfilm ��� which in exploring the intersection between the Beckettian and the Keatonesque finds a hitherto uncharted dimension of human and cinematic experience." in the end a good thing. The work of Beckett is an invitation to think and it���s an invitation Mr. Lipman accepts with alacrity. Happily ���Notfilm��� does not neglect behind-the-scenes anecdotes. Though many of the participants are no longer living there are illuminating interviews with Jean Schneider the widow of the director of ���Film ��� and with James Karen a familiar character actor and close friend of Keaton���s who had a role in ���Film.��� These conversations are supplemented with other reminiscences and ruminations by archival stills and clips and by extraordinary audio recordings of script readings." committed to formal rigor and possessing finely tuned comic sensibilities. It is not surprising ��� though it is also somehow astonishing ��� that they worked together once on a film devised by Beckett and titled ���Film.��� A little more than 20 minutes long devoid of dialogue (though not of sound) it was made in New York in the summer of 1965. And it is now the subject of an intelligent affectionate documentary by Ross Lipman titled ���Notfilm.��� (A restoration of the Beckett short directed by his faithful collaborator Alan Schneider accompanies Mr. Lipman���s film during its run at Anthology Film Archives.)"

But while that film was a 99-minute sprint through the Russian past this one lingers over a particular episode during the Nazi occupation of France. It takes the form of an extended cinematic essay blending fictionalized re-enactments of plausible events with excursions into scholarship and fantasy." who ��� is missing from this tableau. As I was leaving a recent press screening a friend asked ���What about the Jews?��� There is indeed something unsettling about a chronicle of European history that gives such prominent attention to the Nazis without so much as mentioning the principal targets of their hatred.

Though many of the Louvre���s great paintings had been hidden in chateaus in the countryside Jaujard and Wolff-Metternich collaborated to keep the museum open during the occupation and to protect its collection." so is a melancholy sense of national grievance. The extent of Russian suffering during World War II is still insufficiently recognized in the West and Russia remains on the margins of the European story. Though present-day politics are outside the frame of ���Francofonia ��� they nonetheless cast a shadow. It���s hard to listen in on the director���s thoughts or to eavesdrop on Napoleon and Marianne without thinking about France���s current identity crisis and also about Russia���s resurgent defensive nationalism." who believed themselves the heirs and masters of European civilization had an interest in protecting Paris���s status as a cultural capital. They were assisted by members of the local elite like Jaujard who chose compromise over resistance. Mr. Sokurov bitterly contrasts the relative normalcy of France under German rule with the siege of Leningrad whose citizens starved and froze and whose cultural patrimony was not spared." ��� which is not rated is in French German and Russian with English subtitles.

Scenes of Baker trying to play in an empty bathtub after the beating blood streaming from the sides of his mouth are agonizing to watch." the makers of ���Born to Be Blue��� made the risky decision not to use Baker���s original recordings.

If Mr. Hawke does a reasonably good imitation of Baker���s plain vibratoless voice singing ���My Funny Valentine��� and ���I���ve Never Been in Love Before ��� he only fitfully captures the fragility embodied in that voice." the movie alternates between black-and-white and color.

Instead Mr. Abraham focuses on the greatest hits and private headlines narrowing in on Hank���s stormy first marriage to Audrey (Elizabeth Olsen) a beauty with a flat voice whose great passion seems to have been a misplaced belief in her own vocal talent. Much of the movie follows the arc of their marriage a grindingly unhappy union marred by her jealousy of Hank���s talent and increasingly plagued by fights and infidelities.

As Hank Mr. Hiddleston leads with charm and a twang keeping the beat with his shoulders hips and feet.

Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes." however appealing never gets below the surface is that Williams is one of those artists whose eloquence is expressed through his work. That eloquence is in his lyrics and melodies as well as a voice that especially when it quavers on the high end conveys a sincerity he transfers to his listeners. That voice has a singular sound and it carries a specific American history and way of feeling and being that finds the holy not only in the Bible but also in a lonesome whippoorwill a midnight train and ordinary life and people. When Williams sang to his audiences they knew that he heard them too."

He has no natural ability to leap a tall building in a single bound and so must rely on intelligence ingenuity and a limitless fortune." and it isn���t thinking either. It���s obedience.

so it���s all the more impressive that he cast not just his aunt but also himself his mother and grandmother in several critical roles. This gives the movie an extra frisson adding to its portrait of a self-destructive woman. There can be something pitiless about Mr. Shults���s gaze but the steadiness of his look is that of the artist who refuses to sell the truth out for sentimentalism. When Krisha stands in the kitchen wild-eyed amid all these human sights and sounds you see a woman overwhelmed by life itself as well as a movie that is an expressionistic tour de force." ��� and with such uncompromising ferocity. A family drama in alternately appalling and queasily hilarious extremis this bravura first feature takes place over an epically terrible Thanksgiving that may inspire you to start leafing through the collected poems of Philip Larkin looking for that one about Mum and Dad. It takes some time to grasp who wronged whom here but it���s clear from the get go that serious damage has been done." the characters ��� with their rapid gestures cacophonous movements and ductile faces ��� express a great deal. The extraordinary peripatetic camerawork and fluid editing (the cinematographer is Drew Daniels; Mr. Shults is the editor) bring characters together even when they���re not talking to one another the rapid lateral pans mapping relationships with revelatory geometric precision.

(She keeps the key to her safe on a chain around her neck.) Much of the movie which runs a very fast expertly jammed 82 minutes involves opening Krisha as it were.

The women in his life run the gamut: blond brunet young old underdressed undressed sane and rather less so. When this one crawls on top of him in bed he murmurs in voice-over ���I remember ��� as the scene fades to black.

As Paul walks the wind picks up and fallen leaves begin eddying around his feet their swirling movement echoing the fluid sweeping camera and helping shift the movie from its more familiar realism into a lyrical register. Head bowed Paul approaches Esther like a sly supplicant advancing obliquely; she in turn appears haughty and amused as she looks down from her perch. The distance between them disappears when he at last sits next to her inaugurating a flirty conversation relayed in sumptuous close-up." these memories are the truth (���I remember���) the foundations of his existence. They have shaped him making him the man who when someone asks ���Who are you? ��� looks genuinely bewildered. ���I can���t remember ��� Paul answers. It���s a strange assertion particularly given that most of the movie is a collection of remembrances. Then again as Paul says several times ���life is strange ��� a (true) statement that becomes as much a refrain in ���My Golden Days��� as another of his repeated confessions: ���I feel nothing.���" the second turns on a flashback introduced by the adult Paul who having been stopped at the French airport ends up describing his mysterious Soviet trip to a French intelligence agent (Andr�� Dussollier). As the present gives way again to the past Paul recounts how during his Soviet jaunt he gave his passport to a Jewish dissident who assumed Paul���s identity becoming an effective double. Mr. Desplechin likes to throw a lot into his stories and not everything he puts into play necessarily seems to fit. But the passport and Paul���s refusenik doppelg�_nger add layers to a story that chapter by chapter evolves into a meditation on identity." slipping in nods to ���Ulysses��� alongside the post-punk band Marine Girls. There���s a restless intelligence to his sampling which always feels organic experiential instead of merely ornamental. In ���My Golden Days ��� which largely takes place in the 1980s every musical literary and fashion cue speaks to the moment when Paul began a feverish love affair. When he reads the Yeats poem ���Among School Children��� (���She stands before me as a living child���) there���s meaning in the moment as there is when the score picks up a haunting thread from Alfred Hitchcock���s ���Vertigo.���" a story told through a glass darkly. (Paul played by Mr. Amalric also appears in Mr. Desplechin���s 1996 film ���My Sex Life ��_ How I Got Into an Argument.���) A kind of embodied Proustian madeleine Irina inspires Paul���s reminiscing setting off flashbacks that can seem like dreams. In the first chapter ���Childhood ��� Paul violently confronts his unbalanced mother and flees into the arms of his great-aunt Rose (Fran�_oise Lebrun a star of the 1973 film ���The Mother and the Whore���) and her Russian lover (Irina Vavilova). In the second ���Russia ��� he travels to the Soviet Union where he and a school friend play adult spy games with dissidents." Paul is a lanky adolescent (the newcomer Quentin Dolmaire) and a jittery charmer ready for love. He finds it in the third and final chapter ���Esther ��� named for the girl (Lou Roy-Lecollinet another superb discovery) whom he takes up with. At this point he���s a poor student living on his own in Paris where he studies anthropology. During a visit to his childhood home he swings by a courtyard where he meets some friends and his sister. There he also sees Esther (she���s a beacon impossible to ignore) sitting on a bench with a cluster of people who soon clear out. By the time Paul makes his move Esther alone and elevated the camera whirling below her looks like a statue on a pedestal." we know feels deeply all the way to the shattering epilogue which suggests that his memories of Esther ��� who teary encounter by teary encounter he makes the very image of the needy woman consumed by passion ��� don���t line up with who she was. The final scene echoes the opening with Paul once again in bed with a woman he will separate from. For all the slim-hipped boys who cluster around him it is women ��� his mother his great-aunt her lover his beloved professor and most important Esther ��� who serve as the signposts in his life. They help write the story of this solitary man this restive anthropologist who after leaving his tribe and losing his identity has a chance to make himself whole with a girl whose love is at last too great for him to bear." ��� an elegy for young love and its lingering ache a wind starts to stir.

But where once autumn leaves swirled at Paul���s feet he now finds himself walking ���in keeping with the story���s romantic melancholy ��� amid a tornado of flying book pages and thinking of the girl who once loved him. ���The hour of the waning of love has beset us ��� William Butler Yeats writes in his poem ���The Falling of the Leaves.��� Paul we know began reading Yeats early."

Ms. Senko invited video submissions from others who have had similar experiences with loved ones and those provide the film���s most heartfelt moments. But the nastiness that has been brought out into the open by the current presidential campaign demonstrates that hatred and suspicion are more endemic than a collection of personal stories suggests.

the air of imperial invincibility that Armstrong projected so skillfully is missing.

Because his voice is higher and lighter than Armstrong���s his pronouncements evoke a quality political pundits once ascribed to the first President George Bush: the wimp factor." his sneaky fish-eyed performance suggests he is the director���s designated hit man. Anyone might think twice before buying a used car from this man or even shaking his hand to seal a transaction." hypercompetitive narcissist addicted to the spotlight who grows to believe his own hype and is mercilessly vindictive toward anyone who threatens him. It is a measure of the public���s desperate desire for heroes and the greed and duplicity in sports that the scam continued for as long as it did." he wants some for himself and his teammates. And when he consults with Michele Ferrari the Italian doctor cycling coach and champion of EPO (played with a farcical edge by Guillaume Canet) what the movie dubs the most sophisticated doping scandal in sports history shifts into high gear." ��� which was begun when Mr. Gibney was in the thrall of his subject���s mystique.

There is no mention of his childhood or adolescence or any attempt to analyze his character. When the movie touches on the Livestrong Foundation Armstrong���s charitable support organization for those with cancer it is portrayed as a cynical buffer against allegations of drug use. The movie strongly suggests that the testicular cancer for which Armstrong was treated in the 1990s before his ascent was brought on by performance-enhancing drugs." ��� Stephen Frears���s patchy docudrama tracing the rise and fall of the disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong tell you all you need to know about this crude cinematic demolition job. In one the Armstrong character (Ben Foster) studies himself in a mirror while rehearsing different versions of the statement ���I���ve never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.��� No matter how he says it the words ring false."

��� at the Venice Film Festival last September I was impressed by its insight and bothered by what I took as a certain glibness a too-easy accommodation of moral horror to the imperatives of the thriller genre. On subsequent viewings I���ve come to appreciate this ambiguity as part of what Mr. Trapero is trying to address and as an essential aspect of what his film reveals about the nature of authoritarianism. Fascism is seductive not only because it feeds fantasies of power and greatness but also because at a primal visceral libidinal level it can be a lot of fun." which I don���t entirely mean as praise. Mr. Trapero���s energetic style his almost gleeful juxtapositions of sex and violence and his exuberantly Scorsesean musical cues often pull against the gravity of the story. The period details are meticulous and the shifting d��cor of the Puccio home provides a catalog of strenuously tasteful ���80s bad taste that may touch a nostalgic chord in middle-aged viewers. The kidnappings and ransom negotiations provide jolts of suspense as does the larger narrative of Arqu�_medes���s unraveling ambitions. As Argentina inches toward democracy he becomes more desperate and reckless; Alejandro���s doubts about his father grow; and an inevitable reckoning approaches for the family and the nation alike." returning from a year abroad is initiated into it. Their sisters and their mother are not expected to participate and one of the questions Mr. Trapero raises is how much they know or permit themselves to know about what is happening under their noses. Mostly they regard Arqu�_medes with deference and adoration helping to fashion an image of the perfect traditional family. He helps his daughters with their homework addresses his wife with chivalrous courtesy and strives to embody a Latin American version of a ���Leave It to Beaver��� fatherly ideal. He���s a provider and a protector ��� stern kind capable and patient." ��� Pablo Trapero���s wrenching exciting new film could be described as an examination of the banality of evil. It���s the story closely based on actual events of an ostentatiously normal family involved in crimes enabled by a climate of political violence and repression." Arqu�_medes Puccio played with regal sang-froid and deadpan perversity by Guillermo Francella is also a study in the evil of banality. His steadfast attachment to conformity and respectability is inseparable from his coldblooded self-serving sadism. In his own mind everything he does ��� the kidnappings the beatings the occasional murder ��� is an expression of his essential rectitude. He���s a good father a good businessman a paragon of petit-bourgeois virtue who happens to keep hostages tied up in the basement." and in the years since in the midst of economic and political turmoil its writers and filmmakers have grappled with the legacy of the ���dirty war.��� Mr. Trapero has set out to examine the period from the perspective of the guilty to explore the psychology of both the active collaborators with a brutal system and its passive beneficiaries. The cleverest and most troubling aspect of the film is its empathy." when Argentina was ruled by a military dictatorship that specialized in ���disappearing��� its suspected political opponents. Arqu�_medes though he is proud of his government connections (and adept at exploiting them) has neither an official position nor any particular ideological commitment. He���s in it for the money selecting his prey based on the ransom he can collect. Rather than targeting supposed leftists he and his accomplices ��� principally his son Alejandro (Peter Lanzani) ��� focus on members of their own class and social circle including a young man who belongs to Alejandro���s rugby club." grotesque comedy in the gap between who the Puccios ��� Arqu�_medes above all ��� really are and who they pretend to be and Mr. Trapero whose other features include the intense prison drama ���Lion���s Den ��� choreographs the contradictions of their domestic life with ferocious wit. ���The Clan��� is partly a dark satire of the authoritarian personality an appalling CT scan of male entitlement and middle-class vanity." though despicable is also intriguing and charismatic partly because of Mr. Francella���s commanding disarmingly dignified performance. As fans of recent antihero-driven cable dramas know it���s hard not to identify with a complicated protagonist and Mr. Trapero exploits this habit of identification ensnaring the audience and maybe also the film itself in an ethical trap. The violence is exciting and its perpetrators are more interesting more vivid and more real than the victims."

squinting eyes and hard-set jaw are as essential to Mr. Nichols���s imagination as shotguns and pickup trucks ��� shows up in ���Midnight Special��� as one of a pair of outlaws who have recently kidnapped a child. Or so it appears. Though Roy (Mr. Shannon) and Lucas (Joel Edgerton) are grim-faced heavily armed and unnervingly competent their victim a boy named Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) doesn���t seem afraid of them and indeed acts more like an accomplice than like prey." ���Midnight Special��� is a parable of parental love a heartfelt look at the challenges involved in loving and possibly losing an extraordinary child. ���I like worrying about you ��� Roy says to Alton at an especially grave and touching moment and his words are a beautiful and concise summary of a common emotion. The context in which they occur is completely outlandish and the charm and audacity of this film lie in the way it blends the commonplace and the bizarre." equally misleading set of associations. Here is a stern patriarch (Sam Shepard) flanked by goons in bad suits. Here are platoons of women with long plaited hair and long homespun dresses. Here is the F.B.I. coming in heavy. We might assume that we���re in the territory of the Branch Davidians or a polygamous quasi-Mormon sect. It seems possible that Alton who was taken from their midst was not abducted but rescued." a flight of visual sublimity looks a little too much like images pulled from an advertiser���s dream board or an architect���s digital sketchpad. Sometimes the best move for a visionary is to keep the visions out of sight. And the surest way to arouse a sense of wonder is to leave us with something to wonder about." defiant prison ballad has to do with what you just saw. I have some thoughts on the subject. The Midnight Special in the song is strictly speaking a train but it���s also a symbol of redemption one of many that decorate the many-colored garment of American folklore." we learn is Alton���s father and Lucas is an old buddy of Roy���s who has literally seen the light. The boy���s disappearance becomes less a matter of religious freedom and pastoral authority than of national security as a geeky National Security Agency operative (Adam Driver) takes over the case from the law enforcement guys. The boy somehow has access to top-secret codes and coordinates. He becomes a human GPS tracing a zigzagging route along the picturesque back roads of Texas and Louisiana and pausing to visit his mother Sarah (Kirsten Dunst) and to pull a satellite out of the sky into a parking lot." whose fondness for high-stakes boys-adventure stories was especially evident in the Mark Twain-inflected ���Mud��� (2013) plays with various allusions and possibilities. He doesn���t overdo the self-consciousness but he knows that the audience has a soft spot for unusual children whose aura of innocence is a screen for otherworldly powers. Alton could be a boy genius or a musical prodigy. The adults in his life fear for his safety and are also a little afraid of him and their desire to protect him is mingled with the urge to exploit his gifts." a writer and director of three previous features has a sincere interest in the traditions of American spirituality including its wilder manifestations. He is also willing to entertain ��� and to entertain his audience with ��� the possibility that the zealots and crackpots may be onto something. In his second feature ���Take Shelter ��� (2011) Michael Shannon played a hard-working family man plagued by forebodings of cosmic catastrophe. The movie spun a web of anxiety and ambiguity around the question of whether he was delusional or clairvoyant." which he pores over with scholarly intensity as if they were works of reference rather than fantasy. And in comics anything can happen. The rules of space time and narrative order can be redrafted at will as long as the writers and inkers stay on the right side of the line that separates chaos from coherence. Mr. Nichols has an efficient naturalistic style. His movies look and sound like Sundance-sourced exercises in regional realism and he is sensitive to the nuances of feeling that infuse even the strangest circumstances and also the most ordinary." but rather its godhead. You get that impression looking into his eyes especially when tractor beams of bright blue radiance shoot out of them like bolts from Harry Potter���s wand. His gaze has the power to set walls grown men and the earth itself atremble." since even the vaguest most careful description of Jeff Nichols���s ���Midnight Special��� risks giving away some important surprises. This is a film that generates much of its suspense through genre sleight of hand. If I even try to tell you what kind of movie it is ��� crime story road picture science-fiction allegory religious prophecy ��� I might be telling you something you���d rather not know just yet."

And her blissful expectations for the future are tainted by doubt. When Abdolreza interrogates her at the end of an exhausting day clouds have darkened the sunny skies." the movie is a tawdry tale of marital discord in which Mojdeh and Morteza go at it tooth and nail. Their plans to visit Dubai with their young son Amir Ali (Matin Heydarnia) are disrupted by their domestic strife. Their apartment strewn with possessions under sheets of plastic is in a state of chaos. There is a smashed window broken by Morteza in a fit of rage." a time of spring cleaning and dressing up in new clothes for family reunions is the backdrop for this incisive 2006 film by Mr. Farhadi the Iranian director who achieved international recognition with ���A Separation.���" an ebullient young woman first seen on the back of a motorcycle driven by her fianc�� Abdolreza (Houman Seyedi).

The same gender conflict drove Mr. Farhadi���s fourth film ���About Elly ��� released last year in which a lurking unease affected couples sharing a house on a summer holiday. In their sophistication and unsparing portraiture of grown-up combatants these films are diametrically opposite in spirit to the first wave of Iranian films focusing on children and nature." the festival is a reflection of the troubled marriage of an affluent middle-aged couple and by extension a larger battleground in an undeclared war of attrition between the sexes and the classes. Iranian society may be a traditional patriarchy but at least in the sophisticated precincts of Tehran its capital city wives often call the shots and husbands tremble in fear of their rage. As with Mr. Farhadi���s other films every detail of speech and body language resonates." they could easily be mistaken for deadly wartime explosions in a city under siege. And in a way they are."

Even scenes set in a church look to uplift viewers rather than convert them. The stresses of parenthood and illness are the main emphasis here and if the film follows the formula of an inoffensive Lifetime movie that works well enough to keep the tale perfectly watchable." the middle child of three daughters of Christy (Jennifer Garner) and Kevin (Martin Henderson) begins experiencing pain that worsens until the cause ��� a rare and potentially fatal intestinal disorder ��� is diagnosed." and a scene in which she begs a receptionist for help is especially heartfelt.

In that movie Ethan Hawke played a drone operator in Las Vegas increasingly sickened by having to deploy missiles that killed women and children. The movie reserved special contempt for the Central Intelligence Agency whose attitude toward collateral damage was portrayed as one of indifference.

At moments he seems near tears." and it is a great one suffused with a dyspeptic world-weary understanding of war and human nature.

And there is an intriguingly melancholy strain in both his writing and in this mostly celebratory film. Great cities are places of constant change hectic loss occasional violence and painful division.

Colleagues and expert witnesses are summoned to pay tribute to his genius and annotate his quirks. We spend some time with Laurie Ochoa his wife and erstwhile editor and their two children.

Mr. Gold resolved to eat at every restaurant on Pico Boulevard a 15-mile thoroughfare that runs from downtown Los Angeles in the east to Santa Monica in the west. The project confirmed what he had already suspected about his native city whose geography and demography created a complex and constantly shifting mosaic of cuisines: Los Angeles is an incubator of cultural and commercial variety.

Sucked into this new addiction David has persuaded himself that his virtual affair is real." ���Creative Control��� surfs its subject as if unaware of the possibilities. Watching David use his glasses to surreptitiously record his encounters with the real Sophie I was reminded of a recent episode of the fascinating Showtime documentary series ���Dark Net ��� in which a filmmaker who lost an eye in a gun accident replaced it with a camera.

By the time disaster strikes Kristian and his youngest child are bidding a nostalgic goodbye to their house while his wife Idun (Ane Dahl Torp) and Sondre are at the hotel where she works. Both Mr. Joner and Ms. Torp have somewhat protuberant eyes that make them a mirror for the audience though as their characters swing into parental survivor mode you���re reminded that this is the land of the Vikings from their resolve to their awesome man-crushing thighs." ���The Wave ��� which centers on a family swept up by a tsunami in Norway has been as seductively calm and beautiful as a tourist board commercial. The director Roar Uthaug and his team make some smart moves none shrewder than setting the story in and around a real southwestern town Geiranger which faces a long deep fjord. A Unesco World Heritage site the fjord is the movie���s true commanding star with soaring verdant and denuded rock walls flanking a glassy inlet that snakes along for miles before spilling into the sea. It���s one of those dreamy destinations that by virtue of its appeal can turn goose bumps of delight into nightmarish shivers." ���The Wave��� has three ready-made narrative movements ��� setup catastrophe and aftermath ��� populated by indispensable regrettably sacrificial and casually disposable characters. In other words somebody has to play Shelley Winters���s role in ���The Poseidon Adventure ��� somebody else gets to be Charlton Heston (pick your flick) while everyone else goes bye-bye. The filmmakers amusingly stack the deck by making the heroes members of an attractively close family that���s packing up to move when the story opens. Better yet the father Kristian (Kristoffer Joner) is a jumpy geologist who���s been monitoring a nearby mountain a restless giant whose collapse would instigate a tsunami that would wipe away the town and turn pleasure boats into broken bathtub toys." just not when.

The mountains are summertime green but the inlet isn���t yet jammed with cruise ships and the village isn���t overrun with visitors. The limited number of ships and sightseers concentrates your focus on the family and the natural world allowing you to see the ease with which these people navigate their environment. You can intuit an entire family drama in the shot of the teenage son Sondre (Jonas Hoff Oftebro) perched alone at the water���s edge dwarfed by a place he doesn���t want to leave.

Rick grew up with two brothers. One of them has died and the other (Wes Bentley) is a tormented soul with a suggested history of addiction and instability. Their father (Brian Dennehy in effect playing Brad Pitt���s role in the earlier movie) is full of grief and regret and the ache at the center of Rick���s existence seems to arise from the inadequacy of paternal and fraternal love." ��� the man���s name is Rick and he is played with mopey eyes a diffident half-smile and a scruff-bedecked chin by Christian Bale. Rick is a Hollywood screenwriter who seems stuck in the long second act of his mortal script. The questions of how to begin how to proceed haunt him and determine the elusive structure of the film���s narrative. Its title is drawn from the tarot deck as are the titles of its constitutive sections: ���The Moon ��� ���The Hanged Man ��� ���The High Priestess ��� among others. This suggests that the order of events may be random serendipitous a matter of occult meaning rather than chronological sequence." like most of the other speech in the movie ��� is ���begin.��� Curiously enough that is also the penultimate word of ���Portnoy���s Complaint.���" voiceless topless women ��� whose lithe bodies at once symbolize Rick���s existential quest and distract him from it ��� might as well be premium-cable eye candy. Like Paolo Sorrentino���s ���Youth ��� ���Knight of Cups��� settles into a lukewarm bath of male self-pity a condition perhaps more deserving of satire than sanctification. Rick mopes and mutters through an elegantly appointed malaise wandering the desert in an Armani jacket and driving aimlessly in his midnight-blue vintage convertible. In the room the women come and go. It���s all very poetic and rarely boring except maybe to Rick himself. But it���s hard to trust his anguish and hard not to suspect that what is being solicited is not your empathy but your envy." turning the tale that has come before into an extended Jewish joke. Mr. Malick���s film is not especially comical and he is surely one of the least Jewish directors in the annals of American cinema but his ending has a similarly startling effect. We���ve been watching a man���s life ��� his sex life in particular ��� unspool before our eyes only to learn that we haven���t even gotten started. Or that he hasn���t." at the same time a linear direction to Rick���s wanderings is implied by the invocation early and late of John Bunyan���s ���The Pilgrim���s Progress.��� We must be going somewhere toward some place of redemption. Bunyan���s allegorical City of Destruction ��� and also perhaps the Celestial City that is its antithesis ��� is incarnated by modern Los Angeles. Its architecture its vegetation and its light are all exquisitely rendered by the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who just won his third consecutive Oscar. Los Angeles like Paris and Manhattan is vulnerable to cinematic clich�� and at the same time through the right eyes endlessly resistant to it. Mr. Lubezki can infuse Sunset Boulevard Venice Beach and other often-filmed spots with a beauty that feels erotic and metaphysical at the same time." the confusion of eros and cosmos ��� or maybe to be generous their mutual entanglement ��� is Rick���s big problem and also Mr. Malick���s. At its most literal level ���Knight of Cups��� is an encyclopedia of its protagonist���s love affairs casual and serious painful and frolicsome blonde and brunette. There are threesomes pillow fights rooftop debauches and skinny-dipping parties.

But somehow the effort translates into this talented performer holding back a little too much losing the expressive verve that firing on all pistons as a comic seems to give her. It also doesn���t help that Ms. Fey���s sharpest past work has simultaneously skewered the archetype of the neurotic single professional and complicated it with a self-conscious edge that this film could use." ���The Taliban Shuffle ��� ���Whiskey Tango Foxtrot��� contains the fondly proudly recalled details of battle-tested experience.

Kim���s rise-and-fade arc is sympathetically rendered with humor and the urgency of an underhand pitch. The frazzled editing of Kim���s arrival in Kabul as a na��f subsides early replaced by a narrative glide that hints self-knowledge will emerge from the chaos. Kim���s achievements are swiftly packaged as personal wins such as when she proves her savvy to a top Marine officer (Billy Bob Thornton) she���s reporting on." it���s undercut by fuzzy platitudes near the end of the film. Ms. Barker seems to have earned the reward of such a reassuring conclusion but it���s not clear the movie has." she also finds herself and cracks a few jokes. That���s not entirely unexpected because Kim is played by Tina Fey an old hand at portraying the self-deprecating nerdy workaholic getting a handle on her personal life. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa ���Whiskey Tango Foxtrot��� suggests a serious extension of Ms. Fey���s best-known comedic persona on more treacherous terrain and with an Afghan culture clash.

(Carly Adams plays his sister Sally; Thomas Bair plays their younger sibling Christopher; and a charmer named Dante Hoagland plays a neighbor Howie.) Unlike his parents Jacob soon becomes hip to Anna���s menace which takes on increasingly violent form. Mr. Thielen plays out the child endangerment angle throughout building on the early unease with flashback-filler and some florid sadism that suggests the filmmakers share Anna���s philosophy toward child care." another young woman calling herself Anna (Sarah Bolger) is rubbing blood off her sneaker and hopping into a different car on her way to a babysitting gig.

In long shot a teenage girl walking on a tree-canopied street in Anywhere U.S.A. is suddenly snatched and hustled into a car. It���s a disquieting overture partly because it takes place in daylight. Mostly though it���s because there are no close-ups of the assault no cutaways to the presumably terrified victim or views of her two abductors a man and a woman who materialize as if out of nowhere. This is terror at an artful remove." rigid and rhythmic about Anna���s smiles (it���s as if she were reminding herself to express emotion) and something unsettling almost predatory about how she fixes her gaze. By the time Dan and his wife Joyce (Susan Pourfar) are walking out the door leaving their three rowdy tots in Anna���s care you may be ready to call child services. Dan and Joyce seem too distracted by their anniversary to notice their new sitter���s weird vibe but they also come off as fairly witless. The opening kidnapping has already destabilized the sense of the ordinary reassuringly familiar life that horror movies inevitably disrupt. Yet in making the parents so careless the director Michael Thelin has to work to bring you back into the movie���s world which he does with unnerving fits and starts an imperiled pet and several appealing peewee actors."

��� one of those productions in which much of the creative energy has been funneled into gaudily inventive displays of violence. Except for the Jewish mob everything else conforms to genre type: the doomed prostitute the talk of one last job etc. It���s a disappointing waste of an appealing cast that includes Casey Affleck Anthony Mackie Aaron Paul Clifton Collins Jr. Norman Reedus Teresa Palmer Michael K. Williams and that reliable M.V.P. Woody Harrelson. One of the few other female speaking parts belongs to the Israeli actress Gal Gadot whose big moment involves guiding Michael suddenly as helpless as a Samson with a crew cut to bed. Presumably Ms. Gadot will have more to do when she plays Wonder Woman in some forthcoming superhero movies." so his weird bids at mordant comedy feel as forced as they are ill-considered whether he���s connecting a sign for ���Kosher meats��� with bloodied victims or dropping a flip reference to ���La Kosher Nostra.��� These jokes are especially sour given that the only decent man in the story has a cross hanging from his neck and another on a wall. It���s baffling what Mr. Hillcoat thinks he���s doing with this imagery. He has a gift for casting talent and for conveying the intimacy of a shared endeavor whether the focus is on two men or an entire SWAT team. That he also has an eye for detail remains as evident as it was in his last feature ���Lawless ��� a disappointment which was released by the Weinstein Company." the only characters with anything to do are men; they���re decent or corrupt cops (sometimes both) others are former Special Forces. (It���s a drag that the faces of the darker-skinned actors sometimes melt into the shadows that Mr. Hillcoat likes so much.) They���re backed by a phalanx of supporting players who provide some atmosphere by throwing gang signs glowering at the police and running and gunning in a battlefield that could as easily be Los Angeles or Mexico City. An image of a child and a violent video game suggests that the filmmakers (the script is by Matt Cook) mean to draw lines between onscreen and offscreen violence but that moment quickly passes leaving no trace." even if she routinely likes to ditch the refined English rose thing for something down-market and a little rough. Here she plays Irina Vlaslov a Russian-Israeli hausfrau and mob wife who in between rolling out what looks like rugelach dough and getting her hair set and shellacked runs the business while her husband does time. She���s a ridiculous flamboyant conceit and would be easy to write off if her depravity were not so yoked to her Jewishness. But Irina is a particularly ugly scheming spider woman who spins her web while running her yarmulke-wearing thugs ominously cooing at her young nephew (Blake McLennan) and forcing his desperate father Michael (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to do very bad things." the thriller ���Triple 9��� comes dressed to kill. Directed by John Hillcoat it purrs to a start with men plotting in near dark a hook-y start that establishes the look and mood. Within minutes the men are robbing an Atlanta bank in a scene filled with gunfire and rattling visceral specifics like the wet stains spreading under the weeping prostrate employees.

But Mr. Eggers���s sharpest decision what makes you and the movie jump is that he stays inside the characters��� worlds and heads all disastrously close quarters. These are people who fervently believe both in the Devil and in God and for whom witches are as real as trees; it���s no wonder that their inability to tame the New World blurs with their fears.

There are gods and fathers in ���The Witch��� as well even if this movie finally settles into a specifically American story about a catastrophe of faith." ���The Witch��� opens on a scene of religious wrath. On a New England plantation around 1630 a true believer William (Ralph Ineson) and his family are facing a grim assemblage. The setting is a kind of meeting house crowded with men women and children a congregation whose silence and unsmiling faces imply disapproval or perhaps fear. Whether they���re standing in judgment doesn���t matter to William whose arrogant faith in his own notion of Christianity is as deep and darkly unsettling as his sepulchral voice. It���s the sort of soul-and-earth-quaking voice you can imagine one of the biblical patriarchs having the kind that Abraham used on God and Isaac alike." ���The Witch ��� takes place in an America that in its extremes feels more familiar than its period drag might suggest. It���s set a decade after the Mayflower landed in Plymouth and tracks William���s family as it leaves the plantation to settle down alone at the edge of a forest. There the family members build a farm grow corn and commit themselves to God a contract tested by a series of calamities that turn this story of belief into a freak-out of doubt. As the wind stirs the trees and the children taunt one another with talk of witches you may remember that the movie���s subtitle is ���A New-England Folktale.��� Something wicked this way comes?" these creatures skitter around the edge of the story their baaing and barking creating a homey cacophony with the giddy squeals of the family���s children. From afar the farm looks as pretty as a needlepoint sampler with its belching chimney stacks of corn and quaintly dressed figures. Closer up though the scene appears harder tougher and so do William and his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) a pair of Grant Wood prototypes. Their pinched and planed faces make a graphic contrast with that of their eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) whose peaches-and-cream complexion looks too insinuatingly succulent for a world of such punitive austerity.

who has written about his own personal struggles with bipolar disorder has directed a film that flirts with madness (some would say dangerously) while not going over the edge. For a time it almost seduces you into taking seriously the couple���s shared delusions. Any creative person who has had what might be a brainstorm when the emotions veer into overdrive and the mind and metabolism suddenly race will understand the exalted scary place in which Marco and Carla find themselves." they paint the walls in an enlarged copy of that van Gogh masterpiece. Van Gogh Marco assures Carla was bipolar as were any number of great painters and writers whose names appear in a long list at the end of the film." whether parents or doctors could have been portrayed as the repressive enemies of free expression. There is no conveniently monstrous Nurse Ratched to rebel against. Marco���s father (Griffin Dunne) and Carla���s parents (Christine Lahti and Bruce Altman) bend over backward to be caring and understanding." the self-centered belief in yourself as especially attuned to the truth is a leap of faith. You may have to be a little crazy to make that leap." ��� Paul Dalio���s extraordinarily sensitive nonjudgmental exploration of bipolar disorder and creativity. When Marco (Luke Kirby) and Carla (Katie Holmes) poets with the condition also known as manic depression meet at a group-therapy session in a mental hospital their emotional combustion undercuts any available treatment." ���Touched With Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament.��� Marco and Carla visit Ms. Jamison in the movie and she reassures them that taking lithium hasn���t diminished her creativity. Although awkward this scene shoehorned into the film to be reassuring crucially tilts a movie that might otherwise be misinterpreted as an invitation to embrace madness in the direction of medical common sense." they adopt a you-and-me-against-the-world attitude and embark on a mind trip fueled by Marco���s science-fiction-worthy interpretation of the mystical connections among things. They build an impenetrable fantasy of themselves as displaced otherworldly beings and parents-to-be of a yet unborn miracle child." a disturbing image brief sexuality and drug use. Running time: 1 hour 44 minutes." when a patient can become catatonic and suicidal." Marco a rapper-poet and participant in poetry slams has transferred all his books from their shelves to the floor of his loft to be closer to them. Carla is initially shown in a bookstore nervously reading from a published volume of her work. How talented are they? Not enough of their poetry is heard for anyone to form an opinion but from the bits and pieces included in the movie the answer is not very." and both Mr. Kirby and Ms. Holmes boldly meet the challenge of playing bright high-strung artists struggling with depression. Like Jack Nicholson���s Randle Patrick McMurphy in ���One Flew Over the Cuckoo���s Nest��� and Angelina Jolie���s Lisa in ���Girl Interrupted ��� they can appear supersane until their daredevil behavior reveals them as recklessly self-destructively messianic.

or make the human stakes as vivid. The three sending out those sparks are Tao (Zhao Tao) and her two close male friends Zhang Jinsheng (Zhang Yi) and Liangzi (Liang Jin Dong). An affable easygoing drifter with an expansive smile Tao works in a small store in the city of Fenyang (Mr. Jia���s birthplace). Mr. Jia likes a slow reveal and it isn���t initially obvious that Tao is the movie���s emotional organizing principle whose feelings run surge and erupt. The story tracks Tao and her relations with both Liangzi who works at a coal mine and Jinsheng a budding entrepreneur." which may underplay how deeply moving his work can be. While he invariably addresses larger cultural social and political issues sometimes openly at other times obliquely what makes his work memorable is how those larger forces are etched in the faces and bodies of his characters in the coal dust that defines one man���s reality ��� and by extension one China ��� and the hard mask that defines another truth another China. Here when Tao first walks down a street flanked by modest brick buildings she is moving through a country that is rapidly being lost to what���s optimistically called development. By the end she is living in a new world even if Mr. Jia suggests her soul remains in the old." at once choreographed and spontaneous but there���s no immediate reason for it even when the date 1999 appears on-screen. It isn���t until the next scene when Tao is trading New Year���s greetings that the dance feels tethered to a rationale. By that point though you will have had time to think about the dance to turn it around in your head consider its possibilities and wonder whether the revelers are spontaneously dancing or celebrating the end of the millennium or the 50th anniversary of the People���s Republic. Or perhaps the scene has more to do with Tao a woman who smiles and who dances." directorial solipsism is mistaken for mystery and empty images are turned into endlessly masticated cud for cultists. Although Mr. Jia is obviously conversant with the European art film ��� and East Asian cinema and Hollywood and so forth ��� he has carved out his own ways of making cinematic meaning an approach that draws on different idioms and traditions. He occasionally folds an image into the mix that can feel enigmatic but that over time make sense when considered in the context of the movie as a whole. A shot of an old-fashioned pagoda may not make ready sense may even look like picture-postcard scenery yet by the end of the movie it may make you weep." for instance Tao is right in middle of the action (and the frame) dancing with a large group to the Pet Shop Boys��� dementedly catchy 1993 cover of ���Go West ��� an old Village People tune. The original music video for the Pet Shop Boys��� version an exuberantly surreal pageant includes shots of Red Square and Vladimir Lenin. Mr. Jia doesn���t reference the video but it���s likely he used the cover partly because of its post-Soviet bloc resonance. Whatever the case it���s a lovely festive scene that suggests that everyone is in a party (or Party) mood. When Tao and the others form a conga line it seems as if they have decided to take the song literally:" ��� the latest from the transformative Chinese director Jia Zhangke people stand near a river that weaves through the landscape like a snake. In the first instance three friends light fireworks that send out modest sparks. In the second only two return to the river where they ignite a bundle of dynamite. By the third trip only one of the original three remains everyone���s life having changed as profoundly as China a cataclysm that���s expressed by a series of rapid explosions in the river suggesting a drowning world." Mandarin and English. Running time: 2 hours 11 minutes." Tao chooses one man over the other a decision that fractures the trio and sends the narrative spiraling in different directions. Mr. Jia���s approach means that you have to do a certain amount of interpretive work though mostly you just have to pay attention and be a little patient. If you do you will notice that ���Mountains May Depart��� is a movie of threes: its main characters moments in time narrative sections historical symbols and even aspect ratio come in triplicate. This schematic quality isn���t necessarily obvious on first viewing even though the story���s time frames ��� 1999 2014 and 2025 ��� are announced on-screen and accompanied by a corresponding increase in the size of the image an enlargement that mirrors the character���s expanding universe."

who hit commercial pay dirt with a catchy title and the fusion of two ludicrously opposed nominally irreconcilable cultural touchstones: Austen and zombies. With tongue in cheek and a copy of Austen���s novel of manners apparently by his side Mr. Grahame-Smith added a zombie apocalypse to the Bennet family concerns peppering the chatter about balls romantic prospects and the uncertain future of its five unmarried daughters with asides about human brains scooped out like ���pumpkin seeds from a jack o��� lantern.��� Mr. Darcy is as proud and disagreeable as ever but like Elizabeth he���s also a warrior." the mutually hostile Elizabeth and Darcy are already combatants of a kind whose primary weapons are their witty wounding deeply meaningful words. In the movie Elizabeth and Darcy (Sam Riley a persuasively brooding presence) sling metaphoric arrows at each other now and again but they���re so busy fighting the zombies overrunning the country that their actions invariably drown out everything else. Both pride and prejudice still play their parts but now in service to one tediously repeated joke: the sight of a gentleman or a lady together or alone playing cards or ballroom dancing fatally swarmed by devouring zombies." fighting zombies does nothing to improve on the original Elizabeth Bennet Jane Austen���s heroine from ���Pride and Prejudice.��� In ���Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ��� a character claiming to be Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) wields swords and other deadly blades fires guns and occasionally flashes a leg in order to stomp on a zombie head.

The studio is again Capitol but here the focus is a suit Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) a front-office true believer and a devout Roman Catholic. As tightly wound as the watch he regularly checks Mannix makes problems disappear before they become headaches or scandal-sheet headlines. He���s a pit bull in a fedora but his loyalty to the studio suggests that he���s either an idealist or a fanatic. So what is he?" Caesar!��� is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The usual Hollywood high jinks dames and drama. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes." though is more competent than Mannix who in his looks loyalty and especially his piety is finally the biggest fantasy figure on screen: the studio executive as a man of virtue. For all his church prayers Mannix���s faith is invested in Capitol. He���s an embodiment of the industry���s self-delusion and self-mythology the kind of executive who invokes vision and bullies the help. In this he makes a sly contrast with some Communist screenwriters who are true believers of a different stripe. Their discussions about art and dialectics mirror a side-splitter of a scene in which Mannix consults with four religious leaders about the studio���s depiction of Jesus. As it turns out everyone has something to peddle ��� a talent an angle a god ��� and truly that���s entertainment." but the Coens are not in any great rush to see him rescued. They���re more interested in meandering in and around their dream factory in showing DeeAnna wiggling underwater in a mermaid costume and Hobie doing a headstand in a saddle. Like all the performers at Capitol these two prove supremely good at their jobs which feels almost sentimental for the Coens but is also an acknowledgment of the old film factory���s brilliance. Even Whitlock a high-wattage dim bulb delivers the goods as does Mr. Clooney who paints the purloined actor in 50 shades of smiling idiocy. Whitlock is a boob; he���s also a great Hollywood star." the Coens get around to sketching in a story with the kidnapping of a major Capitol star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) who���s nearing the end of production on one of its big prestige pictures. Also titled ���Hail Caesar! ��� it looks and sounds like one of those dopily sincere religious spectacles that the studios never tire of. (In a Coen-esque flourish it appears at least partly modeled on the 1959 epic ���Ben-Hur ��� in which a lock-jawed Charlton Heston a few years after parting the Red Sea plays a Jewish prince turned Roman slave turned charioteer who has a life-changing encounter with Jesus.) Whitlock���s kidnapping stirs up turmoil and mystery ��� the snatchers portentously call themselves ���the Future��� ��� which leads to Mannix playing shamus as he tries to get back his star." Caesar!��� is one of those diversions that they turn out in between masterworks and duds. It���s a typically sly off-center comedy once again set against the machinery of the motion-picture business. And as usual with the Coens it has more going on than there might seem including in its wrangling over God and ideology art and entertainment. Some of it is familiar and satisfyingly funny even if there are laughs and bits that seem as if they were written to amuse only the Coens and the Turner Classic Movies crowd.

Mayer-like boss insists straight-faced that ���the writer is king!��� It���s a cruel joke one that the Coens play out as Barton is engulfed in flames and madness. As apocalyptic as a Nathanael West hallucination ���Barton Fink��� felt like the testament of two filmmakers who however much they loved movies were happy to torch the industry. Yet here they are in ���Hail Caesar! ��� back on the lot and cracking jokes." for starters much like the stable of stars and extras under his wing. Like some other Coen creations he shares a name with a real person Eddie Mannix a behind-the-scenes fixer who worked for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when it claimed to have more stars than there are in heaven. From the mid-1920s on Mannix prowled that studio serving as Louis B. Mayer���s trusted aide and the studio���s go-between with the unions; he even greenlighted films. He pops up dealing and scheming in some of the sleazier less reliable Hollywood histories but in ���Hail Caesar!��� he���s a straight arrow and effectively an executive suite of one ��� the only big shot on the lot." ���Hail Caesar!��� at times brings to mind one of those old plot-free film revues that featured a grab bag of studio talent performing in strung-together musical comic and dramatic scenes. Among the other marquee names Mannix handles are DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) an aquatic star who enters with a snarl and an Esther Williams splash and a singing cowboy Hobie Doyle (a charming Alden Ehrenreich) who goes from trick riding to wearing a tuxedo amid a froth of satiny gowns and Mid-Atlantic accents. It���s a rough transition especially for Hobie���s director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes perfection) who tries to squeeze the drawl out of the cowboy in an elocution lesson that makes for a very funny duet and illustrates Hollywood magic at its dissembling best." ��� the tumbling tumbleweeds in ���The Big Lebowski ��� the Old World shtetl in ���A Serious Man��� ��� which suits their playfully layered sideways storytelling. (They���re masters of the narrative tease.) Both blunt and opaque the first image in ���Hail Caesar!��� is of a large crucifix in a church where Mannix clutching a rosary is bowed in prayer and soon making the first of his confession-box appearances. Grimacing he comes across as a man with far more on his mind than spiritual matters; Mr. Brolin���s large magnificently sculptural head has rarely looked heavier." the kidnapping seems like an excuse for the Coens to fool around with genre and as they like to do riff on classical Hollywood form and style. Usefully the kidnapping gets Mannix out of his office and onto the set including a soundstage where a song-and-dance man in a sailor suit Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum) makes like a randy Gene Kelly. Mr. Tatum���s number is delightful at once satirical and virtuosic although the winking bawdiness of the choreography is more risqu�� than what would have been allowed in a real 1950s musical. Here as elsewhere the Coens are scratching off the glossy studio veneer to show what lies beneath including unspoken desires even as they���re also putting on the kind of good show that helped build MGM."

Referring to his classic film ���October: Ten Days That Shook the World ��� Eisenstein calls this working vacation ���the 10 days that shook Eisenstein.���" ���Eisenstein in Guanajuato��� revels in male full frontal nudity and unblinkingly observes the naked Eisenstein���s defloration from a middle distance. Eisenstein frequently talks to his penis and laments the lumpy shape of his own body which Palomino assures him isn���t unattractive. After one encounter Palomino ceremoniously plants a miniature Soviet flag between Eisenstein���s buttocks. Such scenes suggest that the film is partly intended as a deliberate affront to Vladimir V. Putin���s Russia where Eisenstein is celebrated as a cultural deity and homosexuality officially despised."

there is a haunting dimension to the film that is only obliquely related to the particulars of its setting. Mr. Gitai conducts an inquiry of the consequences of political extremism a case study of how inflammatory language can sow the seeds of violence. ���Rabin��� shows a democratically elected leader not merely criticized and disrespected but demonized depicted as a dictator and a monster a traitor an alien and an enemy of his people. The kind of rhetoric aimed at Rabin including from the floor of the Israeli Parliament and from members of the opposition party will hardly sound unfamiliar to American ears. We have been lucky so far. But it would be a mistake to view this troubled troubling movie simply as an inquest. It���s also a warning." therefore is likely to be satisfied with it. Anyone with a stake in Israeli politics is sure to find grounds for quarrel while those approaching from the outside may find some of the film���s silences as troubling as its speeches. The Palestinians to the extent that they are mentioned function as an abstraction as if the polarization of Israeli politics didn���t concern them at all. And while it���s true that Rabin���s killing exposed and deepened a schism within Zionism it���s also true that Zionism exists in a larger political context. Acknowledging this would not have made ���Rabin the Last Day��� less upsetting but might have relieved some of the claustrophobia." blurry images that at once bring the event into the present and remind viewers that it belonged to a bygone pre-smartphone era. Then our attention shuttles back and forth in time as episodes before and after the attack are recreated by actors." though it certainly is that. In movie terms it is radically negative undermining any of the genre categories that might make sense of it. It���s a political thriller with an almost infinite tolerance for tedium a detective story with an obvious culprit a courtroom procedural caught up in irrelevant details. It���s a profoundly frustrating movie which is to say that it���s an authentic expression of profound frustration." ���Rabin��� begins with an interview with Shimon Peres the former Israeli prime minister and president and Rabin���s longtime partner and rival in the leadership of the Labor Party. Mr. Peres recalls the polarized poisonous atmosphere of 1995 as the Israeli right mobilized against the Oslo accords and Rabin���s negotiations with Yasser Arafat���s Palestine Liberation Organization. Posters depicting Rabin in a Nazi uniform were set on fire at rallies. He was heckled in the Knesset Israel���s Parliament and spat at in public." the Last Day��� is not interesting in spite of its flaws as a film. It���s interesting because of them because of Mr. Gitai���s refusal or inability to clarify or even coherently narrate the history he addresses. Hebrewless readers can find an illuminating version of the story in ���Killing a King ��� Dan Ephron���s admirably concise and meticulously reported recent book. But Mr. Gitai is not a journalist. In some of his earlier films he has burrowed into painful ambiguous episodes. ���Kedma ��� about the 1948 War of Independence and ���Kippur ��� about the 1973 Yom Kippur War (in which he fought) are difficult stubbornly antiheroic war stories." the Last Day��� is not rated. It is in Hebrew with English subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 33 minutes." the question is still raw and Mr. Gitai for many years one of the most praised and prominent Israeli filmmakers poses it with undiminished anguish. While the earnest bureaucrats of the commission question police officers and limousine drivers a world of religious and ideological zeal is explored that exists at once in plain sight and beyond the reach of their inquiries." but even so the effect ��� and perhaps the intention ��� is to disorient the audience and strip away the literalism of historical dramatizations. Apart from archival news clips and retrospective interviews with Mr. Peres and Mr. Rabin���s wife Leah ���Rabin the Last Day��� often feels more like theater than cinema. It is a series of speeches and depositions a whirlwind of discourse surrounding a terrible and confounding act of violence." the ���Commission was not appointed to investigate the circumstances and causes that led to the creation of the social and political culture of which the murder was an expression ��� and its findings did not ���mitigate the need for in-depth soul-searching in Israeli society.��� Amos Gitai���s new film ���Rabin the Last Day ��� is part of that soul-searching. Arriving 20 years after the assassination it tries both to delve into those incendiary ���circumstances and causes��� and to measure at least implicitly the lingering effects of Rabin���s death." 1995 after addressing a large peace rally in a Tel Aviv square Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel was assassinated by a law student named Yigal Amir. In March of the following year an official commission of inquiry headed by the president of the Israeli Supreme Court documented lapses in security on the night of the killing and intelligence failures in the months before." Rabin���s opponent and now Israel���s prime minister appears before angry crowds encouraging their rage and seeking to turn it to political advantage. The last shot of the film in effect identifies him as the ultimate beneficiary of the assassination."

which opened in New York a few weeks ago might be described as a perverse folk tale set in the present day. Its dry wry minimalism will be familiar to devotees of the Romanian New Wave. Mr. Jude while he shares with his contemporaries an unsentimental interest in human folly and failure departs from the naturalism that has been their collective signature for the last decade. Shot in richly toned wide-screen black and white ���Aferim!��� looks like an elegant exercise in period playacting. But it casts a fierce revisionist eye on the past finding the cruelty and prejudice that lie beneath the pageantry." but in ���Aferim!��� it���s just a fact of life. Mr. Jude has no interest in preaching or in flattering modern audiences by re-enacting the bygone horrors of the old days. Anti-Roma bigotry and extreme inequality have hardly vanished from Romania and the political implications of the story ripple far beyond that country���s borders." but maybe not all that surprising. Romania a small country on the fringe of Europe has a long history of being trampled disrespected and ignored by the world���s great powers. Why should Hollywood be an exception? Marginality is part of the national identity and very much a theme in the recent flowering of Romanian cinema. Persistent unluckiness low self-esteem and compensatory pomposity define the comic universe of ���The Treasure ��� Corneliu Porumboiu���s most recent film for instance." funny and full of life. Nor does the collision of moral horror and profane humor seem in any way forced as it might in let���s say a Quentin Tarantino movie.

He also seems entirely at home in his milieu even as he is troubled from time to time by stirrings of compassion or remorse." good-humored fellow who walks with a limp and swaggers toward trouble with the confidence of someone accustomed to winning fights. He can be menacing when his job and circumstances call for it but he isn���t malicious and he treats Ionita with tough paternal tenderness. He clearly regards himself as a good father and a fair-minded guardian of law and order proud of his title (���Constable���) and aware of the responsibility it confers." this part of the world is a semi-feudal patchwork of villages monasteries and estates. Danger is everywhere and what government exists seems to rest on the principle of might makes right. Power and wealth are concentrated in the hands of aristocratic boyars. One of them has dispatched Constandin and Ionita to capture an enslaved Gypsy who has run away after sleeping with the boyar���s wife." drawing in part from contemporary records and writings exposes how deeply the oppression of the Roma was woven into the 19th-century Balkan social order. Gypsies are routinely referred to as ���darkies��� or ���crows.��� (They address Constandin and his employer as ���bright lord.���) They can be bought sold beaten killed or mutilated according to the whims of anyone in authority. When Constandin and Ionita find Carfin (Cuzin Toma) the slave they���re looking for they shackle his feet and throw him across the front of Constandin���s saddle." who may be familiar to fans of Romanian film from his work in Mr. Porumboiu���s ���12:08 East of Bucharest��� and Cristian Mungiu���s ���4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days ��� gives an exuberantly soulful performance. He has some of Anthony Quinn���s rough charisma and a touch of the loose wised-up humor that John Wayne brought to his later westerns." a man of conscience awakened by the injustice in which he���s implicated. But Mr. Jude loves humanity too much to tell comforting lies about it. His pessimism is somehow the opposite of despair and while the ringing affirmation of his film���s title is obviously sarcastic ���Aferim!��� is neither mocking nor mean. As a species we���re pretty awful but we can also be a lot of fun and even sometimes decent compassionate and wise. How can we live with ourselves? The answer this brilliant movie suggests is that we can���t but somehow we do." in the principality of Walachia a northern region of what is not yet Romania that resembles the territory of a classic western.

This dovetails with The Post���s characterization of modern (human) spy work as ���showing up in a Land Cruiser with some [former] Deltas or SEALs picking up an asset and then dumping him back there when you are through.��� It���s a touch sexier in ���13 Hours ��� which features intrigue over nice meals before everything goes to hell." registering as little more than a succession of strung-together fragmented images of men running and gunning.

as are most of Mr. Kaufman���s scripts; ���Anomalisa��� is more narratively and philosophically streamlined. It also clocks in at a well-timed 90 minutes a relatively abbreviated length that fits this hermetically sealed precariously unoxygenated world with its doll-size scale human avatars fabricated environments and locked-down protagonist.

Next up is a pale cloudy sky ��� it���s the most expansive image in the movie as well as the only representation of the natural world ��� a dreamscape that���s soon pierced by the plane taking Michael to his talk in Cincinnati." including on the play that became ���Anomalisa.��� Like that production the movie stars an excellent David Thewlis as Michael an author and motivational speaker who has traveled to Cincinnati to deliver a speech. He meets a woman Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and they have an intense affair. At this point it seems like a good idea to mention that all the characters in the movie are stop-motion puppets. And that all the other roles are performed by Tom Noonan an invaluable vocalizer who creates a supporting cast of thousands (well dozens) through a voice that rises and lowers barks and purrs and builds the ominous wall of sound that opens and closes the movie as if boxing it shut." ��� a beautiful big-screen whatsit features a throng of whiners malcontents and depressives along with one bright soul who hasn���t let disappointment break her. They���re a funny odd group. Some register as generically prickly full of vinegar and spit (a few may just be tired after a day���s work); others sag as if deflating one breath at a time under an unfathomable weight. And while some carry their burden quietly and alone others insist on sharing it like those people who take deep accusatory sighs when you bump into them on the subway." Duke Johnson who���s a partner in the production company that turned the play into an animation. They make a seamless team. ���Anomalisa��� is a recognizably Kaufmanesque creation in its anarchic and mordant humor its singular narrative beats and especially in its preoccupations (identity authenticity loneliness death love pleasure the usual). And this isn���t the first time that Mr. Kaufman���s work has involved puppets. The lead character in ���Being John Malkovich ��� directed by Spike Jonze is an unhappy puppeteer who works with marionettes that look like him and his wife. In a surreal turn the puppeteer finds a portal into the mind of the title character (played by Mr. Malkovich) who becomes something of a puppet pulling strings of his own." and Michael falls hard. ���Your voice!��� he cries out in wonder a moment of lyricism that the filmmakers tuck in between unbuttoned clothes and an admirably uncomfortable honest sex scene. Lisa may seem like a mess ��� she voluntarily enumerates her supposed failings like someone who���s memorized other people���s criticisms of her ��� yet she���s glorious. And Ms. Leigh who brings Lisa to trembling life with soft mewls of feeling perfectly timed pauses and a poignant a cappella rendition of ���Girls Just Want to Have Fun ��� makes you see how much is at stake both for her and Michael.

Well except that he���s a puppet one with strange black seams that run along his hairline down his chin and cut temple to temple dissecting his face into discrete quadrants. He���s also a puppet that is shortly popping a prescription pill a moment that ��� with his melancholic resignation the usual nightmare of plane travel the droningly familiar voices that swell around him ��� rapidly makes Michael feel somewhat real more recognizable than not. That���s because while ���Anomalisa��� is filled with uncomfortably at times sourly humorous moments it���s also a horror movie about the agonizing banal surrealism of everyday life." despite variations in clothing and hair all have the same eerily blank faces. Once Michael breaks free of the airport herd most of these faces are attached to service workers of one type or another who with degrees of friendliness and hostility masquerading as affability (or professionalism) roll out like dolls on an assembly line.

and many from the early sound years are lost and those that survive have long existed in less than ideally preserved celluloid materials. While contemporary digital restoration can sometimes make decades-old films look like new sometimes it just cannot. The restoration of ���Chrysanthemum��� was clearly done with sensitivity and care and the beauty of Mr. Mizoguchi���s imagery is almost wholly present. But this is a movie whose age does show particularly in what might be called a ���softness��� in the projected image. The restoration nevertheless speaks to the viewer with new clarity. One can now for instance see the matching pattern design of the deerstalker cap and cloak that Kiku wears as he catches the train to Osaka from Tokyo. (Emulations of such Western dress were common during Japan���s Meiji era in which this film is set.)" no implied disapproval of the social order that excludes Otoku. But Mr. Mizoguchi���s artistry and empathy are such that he makes Otoku���s ostensibly ennobling pain palpable. Hence the movie���s tragic dimension is formidable." he is obliged to leave Tokyo and go to Osaka on his own to work with a new troupe. A year later Otoku follows. In one of the film���s most moving scenes she gives Kiku an elaborate dressing table and mirror which barely fits into their tiny living quarters. And so Kiku���s artistic redemption begins even as the couple���s material circumstances dwindle." but he was also an unusually prolific one. By 1939 the year he completed ���The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum ��� a breathtaking melodrama opening in a new restoration Friday he had over 50 films to his credit. Yet it was only with his 1936 feature ���Osaka Elegy��� that by some accounts Mr. Mizoguchi felt he had finally found his artistic footing. ���Chrysanthemum ��� set in late 19th-century Japan tells the story of Kikunosuke (Shotaro Hanayagi) an egotistic Kabuki actor and Otoku (Kakuko Mori) who sacrifices her own happiness to help him achieve greatness." ��� the two Mizoguchi pictures of this period that have been most widely seen in the West were relatively brisk features ���Chrysanthemum ��� at nearly two and a half hours shows the director working in an expansive mode one that would flower even more fully with his postwar masterpieces such as ���The Life of Oharu ��� ���Ugetsu��� and ���Sansho the Bailiff.���" I was struck not just by newly visible detail in the frame itself but also the spectacularly effective nuances of performance from the entire cast particularly the leads. Look for the mincing walk Mr. Hanayagi bestows on the callow Kiku as he negotiates the theater and the geisha house early in the story. As for the perfectly pitched small voice that Ms. Mori uses in her heartbreaking final scene it is impossible not to hear and be moved by it." were she a real person would protest emphatically that for all she gives up over the course of her relationship with the ���young master��� Kikunosuke (���Kiku��� for short) her happiness is in fact realized through her sacrifice. From the beginning of their alliance she insists that her only desire is to help the arrogant actor who is portrayed at the story���s outset as a dim pampered hack more concerned with juggling geishas than learning the family business ��� his adoptive father heads up a renowned Kabuki troupe. Otoku works as a wet nurse for Kiku���s family and so it���s not her place to even speak to him let alone offer the withering assessment of his work that hits Kiku like a head-butt. Recognizing Otoku as the only person who will talk to him honestly Kiku resolves to make her his life coach and his wife." all within the same shot ��� feature beautifully fluid camerawork that draws from the formal traditions of Japanese scroll paintings. Later in the film during a climactic theater performance scene in which Kiku finally gets his thespian mojo working while Otoku hides in the basement and prays for him Mr. Mizoguchi breaks out of that stylistic mode. Here he uses relatively fast-moving and emphatic cutting calling to mind improbable as it may seem vintage Warner Bros. backstage musical dramas like ���42nd Street.���"

They have different approaches to the job in particular the ���dead or alive��� part. Marquis prefers the first option but John known as the Hangman believes in delivering his quarry to the proper authorities more or less intact. And so he is in the company of a live prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who takes an instant dislike to Marquis." who wears a blue United States Army major���s uniform and carries with him a personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. Currently employed like so many Tarantino heroes as a bounty hunter Marquis is well aware that neither his service record nor his connection to the martyred president will secure his dignity or protect him from bigotry. Before long racial epithets and threats of harm are coming his way from all directions." it knows just what to do with Ms. Leigh���s Daisy who enters the film with a black eye and exits it ��� well I guess I���d better not reveal much more. Suffice it to say that she is the film���s scapegoat and punching bag and above all its excuse for its own imaginative failures. At a certain point the n-word gives way to the b-word as the dominant hateful epithet and ���The Hateful Eight��� mutates from an exploration of racial animus into an orgy of elaborately justified misogyny. The final scenes wrap up this shaggy-dog story with a nasty punch line delivering on the promise of the film���s title. I won���t spoil it. See for yourself." ���The Hateful Eight ��� was shot on film with antique lenses and is being projected at some theaters in sumptuous wide-screen 70-millimeter Panavision." a way of separating the fans from the scolds. Mr. Tarantino has made a career out of forcing critics and cinephiles to choose knocking the ambivalent off the fence with brilliant barrages of offensive language and mayhem. So maybe I���m repeating myself: ���The Hateful Eight��� is a Quentin Tarantino movie. But Mr. Tarantino is also repeating himself spinning his wheels here in a way he has rarely done before. None of his other films venture so far into tedium or manage to get in their own way so frequently." along with the stagecoach driver (James Parks) and a newly appointed sheriff (Walton Goggins) seek shelter from a blizzard at a saloon known as Minnie���s Haberdashery where they find a further collection of characters including a retired Confederate commander (Bruce Dern) guilty of massacring black Union soldiers during the war an itinerant hangman (Mr. Roth) and two fellows of dubious background (Mr. Madsen and Demian Bichir). Does this add up to eight? Don���t worry too much about the math. If you read the names that appear on screen just after the overture you���ll know to expect even more company." and of relevance. But much of it seems dumb and ill considered as if Mr. Tarantino���s intellectual ambition and his storytelling discipline had failed him at the same time. Marquis Warren is a remarkable character ��� one of the boldest products of Mr. Jackson���s fruitful collaboration with Mr. Tarantino ��� but the movie can���t quite figure out what to do with him." the three-time Oscar winner Robert Richardson revel in the tonal and compositional possibilities of the format. The dense colors and clever shifts in focus hold your attention when the dialogue starts to sputter. There is quite a lot to see and hear. Almost three hours long ���The Hateful Eight��� has an overture at the beginning ��� a static title card accompanied by a sinister and swaggering Ennio Morricone score ��� and an intermission a little past the midpoint." structurally speaking an Agatha Christie mystery ��� with Marquis in the Hercule Poirot role ��� that ends in geysers of blood. Not only spurting from gunshot wounds but also vomited from the mouths of poisoning victims." ��� with an audacity that may still be underappreciated revisited the anti-Nazi Hollywood action dramas and comedies of World War II and pushed them to an outlandish and weirdly effective conclusion as if the Holocaust could be avenged or undone by a lost platoon of time-traveling movie stars. ���Django Unchained ��� more controversially but no less brazenly turned both moonlight-and-magnolias Southern sentimentality and he-man revenge-mongering upside down offering a vision of African-American male empowerment to rival the wildest dreams of blaxploitation. Set in the Deep South before the Civil War it transformed the prelude to that conflict from a grinding chronicle of resistance and political agitation into a burst of righteous score-settling." its deft manipulation of tension its blurring of the line between slapstick and shock and its intricate weave of allusions to obscure and canonical films of the past ���Hateful Eight��� is ��� what���s the term I���m looking for? ��� a Quentin Tarantino movie. The cast is full of familiar faces from his earlier work: Kurt Russell and Zo�� Bell from ���Death Proof ��� Michael Madsen and Tim Roth from ���Reservoir Dogs ��� and Samuel L. Jackson from just about everything else. The old films that Mr. Tarantino bites off and riffs on now include his own." it also like ���Inglourious Basterds��� and ���Django Unchained��� before it has more than just the history of cinema on its mind. It shares with those movies an impulse to imagine how the fantasy world of film genres might intersect with the cruelty of real-world history and offer a kind of belated symbolic redress. The winking and filibustering are undertaken with the serious intent of collecting make-believe payback for actual wrongs. This is an ethically tricky artistically risky undertaking but in Mr. Tarantino���s hands it is never not interesting." whose acting rises above the mannered self-consciousness that Mr. Tarantino���s writing often calls forth. And the sense that the business of the Civil War remains unfinished produces a current of tension that stretches beyond the walls of Minnie���s Haberdashery into the present. Mr. Tarantino doesn���t make films that are ���about race��� so much as he tries to burrow into the bowels of American racism with his camera and his pen. There is no way to do that and stay clean."

��� a period drama reaching for tragedy Leonardo DiCaprio plays the mountain man Hugh Glass a figure straight out of American myth and history. He enters dressed in a greasy fur-trimmed coat holding a flintlock rifle while stealing through a forest primeval that Longfellow might have recognized. This though is no Arcadia; it���s 1823 in the Great Plains a pitiless testing ground for men that���s littered with the vivid red carcasses of skinned animals ghastly portents of another slaughter shortly to come. The setting could not be more striking or the men more flinty." as with ���Birdman ��� Mr. I����rritu���s last movie this desire to knock the audience out pays off. ���The Revenant��� is a more explicitly serious graver and aspirational effort. Working again with a team that includes the director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki (whose credits include ���Birdman���) and a handful of special-effects companies Mr. I����rritu creates a lush immersive world that suggests what early-19th-century North America might have looked like once upon an antediluvian time. Yet he complicates the myth of the American Eden ��� and with it the myth of exceptionalism ��� by giving Glass an Indian wife and mixed-race son. It���s a strategic move (and another bit of sizzle) that turns a loner into a sympathetic family man. It also softens the story. Instead of another hunter for hire doing his bit to advance the economy one pelt at a time Glass becomes a sentimentalized figure and finally as much victim as victimizer." you know paradise is generally short-lived and here arrows and bullets are soon flying bodies are falling and the muddy banks of a riverside camp are a gory churn. Glass part of a commercial fur expedition escapes with others on a boat and sails into an adventure that takes him through a crucible of suffering ��� including a near-fatal grizzly attack ��� that evokes by turns classics of American literature and a ���Perils of Pauline���-style silent-film serial. Left for dead by two companions Glass crawls out of a shallow grave and toward the men who abandoned him. It���s a narrative turn that suggests he like so many before him is one of D. H. Lawrence���s essential American souls: ���hard isolate stoic and a killer.���" the mountain man has long had a hold on the American imagination and recently made a revisionist appearance in the form of Katniss Everdeen the heroine of ���The Hunger Games.��� The mountain men in ���The Revenant��� are drawn along more traditional and masculine lines from their bushy beards to the buckskins and bulky furs that at times make them look almost indistinguishable from the animals they kill. Mr. I����rritu is entranced by this world with its glories and miseries its bison tartare and everyday primitivism which he scrupulously recreates with detail and sweep. He���s particularly strong whenever Glass employing that old can-do pragmatism goes into survivalist mode to cauterize a wound catch a fish or find shelter." by turns soaring and overblown. Directed by Alejandro G. I����rritu (���Birdman ��� ���Babel���) it features a battalion of very fine hardworking actors none more diligently committed than Mr. DiCaprio and some of the most beautiful natural tableaus you���re likely to see in a movie this year. Partly shot in outwardly unspoiled tracts in Canada and Argentina it has the brilliant crystalline look that high-definition digital can provide with natural vistas that seem to go on forever and suggest the seeming limitless bounty that once was. Here green lichen carpets trees that look tall enough to pierce the heavens. It���s that kind of movie with that kind of visual splendor ��� it spurs you to match its industrious poeticism." at times graphic violence including scenes involving animals. Running time: 2 hours 36 minutes." ��� a 2002 historical adventure by Michael Punke inspired by the real Hugh Glass. In 1823 Glass signed on with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company for an expedition on the upper Missouri River that almost did him in when Arikara Indians attacked the group and sometime later he was mauled by a grizzly sow that may have been protecting her cubs. The bear should have killed Glass. Instead its failure to do so ��� along with Glass���s frontier skills some help from strangers and the indestructible romance of the American West ��� turned him into a mountain man legend and the inspiration for various accounts including a book-length poem and a 1971 film ���Man in the Wilderness.���" which makes him a spacious vessel for interpretation. Mr. I����rritu who wrote the script with Mark L. Smith fills that vessel to near overflowing specifically by amplifying Glass with a vague gauzily romantic past life with an unnamed Pawnee wife (Grace Dove) seen in elliptical flashback. By the time the movie opens the wife is long dead having been murdered by white troops and Glass���s son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) has become his close companion. The son���s name evokes James Fenimore Cooper���s Hawk-eye (���The Last of the Mohicans���) and together Glass and Hawk create an intimate familial bulwark ��� and a multicultural father-and-son dyad ��� in a wilderness teeming with assorted savages." ��� with its butchered animals muddled ideas heart-skippingly natural landscapes and moment after moment of visual and narrative sizzle. What makes too many of his moments ghastly and grand ��� an arrow piercing a man���s throat the beatific face of a beloved a man scooping the innards out of a fallen horse the enveloping softness of the dusk light ��� isn���t the moment itself but that little something special that he adds to it whether it���s a gurgle of blood in a throat or the perfectly lighted sheen of a hunk of offal. Mr. I����rritu isn���t content to merely seduce you with ecstatic beauty and annihilating terror; he wants to blow your mind to amp up your art-house experience with blockbusterlike awesomeness." with repeated images of a spiral and even a flash of homespun magical realism. Worse he makes Glass not just a helpless witness to a murder that���s a stand-in for the genocide of the Indians but also a proxy victim of that catastrophe. It���s disappointing in a movie that offers much and that actually points to another foundation story that emerges when one of Glass���s companions Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) tries and fails to get paid for his labor. He learns too late that the system that turns people and animals into commodities is rigged against men like him. And while the simple facts of that system may be too brutal to feed the ambitions of a movie like ���The Revenant ��� we know that the system nevertheless helped build a nation." everyone is. Mr. I����rritu likes big themes but he isn���t given to subtlety. There���s a shocker of an image for instance in ���Amores Perros ��� his feature debut which expresses his talent for finding the indelible cinematic shot the one you can���t look away from even when you want to and also underscores his penchant for overstatement. One of those multi-stranded stories that he helped repopularize (���Babel ��� etc.) ���Amores Perros��� includes a murder capped by the vision of human blood spilled on a hot griddle. This being a big moment as well as an illustration of Mr. I����rritu���s sensibility the blood doesn���t just splatter it also sizzles. It���s filmmaking as swagger."

She is the kind of movie star who turns everyone else into a character actor. This is not a complaint but an acknowledgment of both her charisma and her generosity. The rest of the cast members have the freedom to be weird awful and lovable in spite of themselves to orbit eccentrically around her celestial presence. Mr. De Niro and Ms. Rossellini in particular seem to be having the time of their lives playing parental grotesques who might have wandered out of a Roald Dahl novel." she invents a new kind of mop the kind that can be wrung out without touching the head. (This household convenience really exists and the character is very loosely based on its inventor and her career.) Flush with entrepreneurial zeal Joy borrows money from her father���s new companion (a supremely haughty Isabella Rossellini) works out the patent and supply-chain issues and prepares to revolutionize American floor cleaning." David O. Russell���s new film ���Joy ��� looks perfectly straightforward even square. It���s a bootstrap-capitalist fable a tale of adversity overcome and rags exchanged for riches a case study in success suitable for a self-improvement seminar." he has emerged as something of a genre magician able to make formulas and clich��s disappear behind a smoke screen of artful misdirection. ���Silver Linings Playbook��� (2012) was an assembly-line romantic comedy tricked out with a wild paint job and a souped-up custom-built engine. ���American Hustle��� (2013) was a caper movie blown up into a pop opera. ���The Fighter��� itself ��� the movie ���Joy��� most resembles ��� was a boxing picture with an irregular heartbeat and a wildly talented cast." breakneck style. The camera never stops moving the people never shut up and the resulting buzz is both stimulating and enervating. There are a few bright spots and calm moments in Joy���s drab frenetic life. Her grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd) believes in her (and provides benevolent voice-over narration). Joy���s ex Tony (�_dgar Ram�_rez) is actually a pretty nice guy and is able like Amy Adams���s character in ���The Fighter ��� to be an ally against the familial back stabbers." the striving pug played by Mark Wahlberg in that movie Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself thwarted and undermined by her own family. In the film���s opening scenes her various relations nearly erase her altogether blocking Ms. Lawrence���s quiet incandescence with ugliness and noise. The divorced mother of two young children Joy left college when her parents split up and now contends daily with a small army of needy narcissists. Her mother Terry (Virginia Madsen) lies in bed all day watching a soap opera (a fake one that Mr. Russell has cast with real-life soap opera stars). Rudy (Robert De Niro) Terry���s ex-husband acts like a helpless child when he���s single and like an entitled patriarch when there���s a woman in his life. Joy also has a passive-aggressive sister (Elisabeth Rohm) and an ex-husband of her own who is living in her basement until his singing career takes off."

the mass murder of the Jews seemed to many artists and intellectuals to exist beyond the reach of representation. It was something to be handled with the utmost care and gravity. But art especially popular art abhors a vacuum and the Shoah is among other things a rich reservoir of stories true and speculative. There are works of narrative ��� like Claude Lanzmann���s ���Shoah��� or the novels of Patrick Modiano ��� that try to measure the gulf between past and present and to document the inadequacy of memory. There are others that try to bridge that gap by recreating or retrieving a sense of what actually happened. ���Schindler���s List��� remains the best-known ��� and one of the best examples. And there are some that try to fill the void with fable and fantasy like ���Inglourious Basterds��� and ���Life Is Beautiful.���" and to signal an uncompromising vision. Mr. Nemes wants to serve the horror raw to bring us as close as he possibly can to the machinery of murder to make cruelty palpable. He subscribes to one of the dubious dogmas of post-World War II aesthetics namely the idea that the representation of real-life atrocity requires the chastening of artifice the stripping away of anything that might smack too much of style." ���Son of Saul��� moves rapidly and relentlessly in the present tense never leaving Saul���s side. Not that we penetrate his thoughts. Mr. Rohrig a poet and former teacher appearing in his first film has the intriguing opacity that distinguishes nonprofessional actors. Like Lamberto Maggiorani in ���Bicycle Thieves��� or Maria Falconetti in ���The Passion of Joan of Arc ��� he is an indelibly particular almost spiritually intense screen presence. His face is hard to read and impossible to forget ��� a mask of stoicism anguish exhaustion and cunning." and becomes obsessed with giving the body a proper Jewish burial. He scrambles through the camp a buzzing hive of hideous and mundane routines in search of a rabbi. He barters and begs and his quixotic project intersects with desperate plans for rebellion and escape that other prisoners are hatching. Mr. Nemes orchestrates a tour de force of suspense a swift symphony of collisions coincidences and reversals that is almost unbearably exciting." everything I have said about this movie so far has to do with its formal strategies and visual tactics. To say that ���Son of Saul��� is a highly stylized self-conscious and calculating piece of narrative is not to say that it���s a bad movie only that it���s a movie. And to say it���s a Holocaust movie is not so much to identify its subject matter as to specify its genre. Mr. Nemes may disdain ���Schindler���s List��� ��� as every ambitious European art-film director must ��� but he is very much in its debt." though Mr. Nemes who favors a hand-held intimate in-the-moment shooting style decidedly does not. The Sonderkommando occupy an especially painful and contested place in the history of the Holocaust. Slave laborers like nearly everyone else in the camps who was not immediately killed they had the job of shepherding their fellow Jews to their deaths and cleaning up afterward sorting through clothes eyeglasses jewelry and other personal effects and burning the corpses." ��� the 38-year-old Hungarian filmmaker Laszlo Nemes���s debut feature. Nearly square it evokes an earlier era when all movies looked this way and also emphasizes the claustrophobia of the story and the setting. We are in a Nazi death camp and really in it to a degree that few fictional films have had the nerve to attempt. The camera doesn���t just survey the barracks and the guard towers the haggard prisoners and brutal guards. It takes us to the very door of the gas chambers in the close company of Saul Auslander (Geza Rohrig) a Jewish inmate who is a member of the camp���s Sonderkommando (special commando) unit." but also troubling. The movie offers less insight than sensation an emotional experience that sits too comfortably within the norms of entertainment. This is not entirely the director���s fault. The Holocaust once forbidden territory is now safe and familiar ground." where ���Son of Saul��� takes place there was a Sonderkommando uprising in 1944 an event that is echoed in parts of the film. After the war members of the Sonderkommando were shunned by many other survivors because they had however involuntarily participated in the slaughter. Some were executed or otherwise punished for collaborating with the Germans." and therefore we don���t see much of what he sees. Mr. Nemes uses shallow focus techniques that blur everything not immediately in front of his protagonist���s face. Though we find ourselves in close proximity to death we are also detached from it. Human figures are blurred movements are indistinct and horrifying sounds ��� cries gasps footsteps blows ��� reach us from invisible sources." German Yiddish and Polish with English subtitles.

There for decades the Salatin family has shunned chemical-heavy farming practices in favor of sustainable rotation and grazing methods. Family members also teach those methods to others; their success has led to many devotees and appearances in several documentaries and books." even as the film avoids sermonizing there are a few too many cutesy shots of happy children and lovely butterflies. More perspective on the hard economics of agriculture would be helpful. Yet those concerns aside this tale of an unorthodox farm may have you nodding along to most everything its operators say and believing that their methods are the best way to help us eat (and live) a whole lot better." the filmmakers and their subjects more often take an optimistic tone when describing their hopes and illustrating the changes they seek in the American way of farming.

as ���Star Wars��� grew into an entertainment machine it took on the aspect of a cult. That at any rate is how it could feel to those of us looking at it from the outside in especially as one mediocre movie after another with noxious creations like Jar Jar Binks crushed the box office. Mr. Abrams may be as worshipful as any ���Star Wars��� obsessive but in ���The Force Awakens��� he���s made a movie that goes for old-fashioned escapism even as it presents a futuristic vision of a pluralistic world that his audience already lives in. He hasn���t made a film only for true believers; he has made a film for everyone (well almost). So will Rey Finn and Poe save the day? Will they battle Kylo Ren and Oedipus too?

Even better was his ���Star Trek ��� an enjoyable big-screen gloss on the 1960s series that he followed with a disappointing sequel taking two steps back. Mr. Abrams is still trying to transcend the worst of the blockbuster imperative but with ���The Force Awakens ��� he shows that he hasn���t stopped learning and that the lessons have begun to pay off. (He���s backed by some of his regular crewmates notably the cinematographer Dan Mindel and the editors Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey.)" created in the wake of second-wave feminism was always a thoroughly liberated woman whether shooting a laser gun or working a metal bikini. Leia is now a resistance general and played with a muted twinkle and tasteful up-do by Ms. Fisher. Like Mr. Ford she has become more of a supporting player in a crowded room that also includes Adam Driver who brings intensity and flowing physical grace to Kylo Ren. Among the strongest creations of Team Abrams Kylo Ren is a kind of baby Darth Vader who throws tantrums in inky-black robes while wearing a leather-and-metal head appliance that looks like a domination mask by way of the grille of a 1952 Chevy." ��� which folds in a father-and-son schism that evokes the one between Luke and Darth Vader. Even so the more interesting Oedipal struggle may turn out to be between Mr. Lucas and his cinematic sons starting with Mr. Abrams. He has delivered a more seamlessly diverting movie than Mr. Lucas has in years but his most far-reaching accomplishment here is casting Mr. Isaac Mr. Boyega and Ms. Ridley ��� a Latino a black man and a white woman ��� in this juggernaut series. It���s too early to know how this will play out as the whole thing evolves but the images of Mr. Boyega and Ms. Ridley each holding a lightsaber are among the most utopian moments in a Hollywood movie this year." really ��� in ���The Force Awakens��� is to have returned to basics largely by dispensing with a lot of clutter. This is no small thing in a complicated movie universe in which the series sequence doesn���t even align with the release dates: The original 1977 film for instance is the fourth in the series and now known as ���Star Wars: Episode IV ��� A New Hope.��� ���The Force Awakens��� is the seventh chapter but also the first film in what���s being called a sequel trilogy. This sounds headache-inducing but it just means that ���Force��� picks up years after ���Return of the Jedi��� (1983) the third release left off after Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) prevailed over villainy with his sister Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and their pal Han Solo (Mr. Ford)." born to the blockbuster world they helped make. At its best that world taps into the wonder that can come with new visions and realms sending you into raptures with earthly delights or those in galaxies far away. Too often though this world gives privilege to special effects and anonymity over story character directorial vision or just a little creative intelligence. Instead moviemakers bludgeon viewers numbing them into quiescence with pictorial monotony punctuated by apocalyptic clamor with the same repetitive story beats explosions close shaves and grindingly unsurprising saves. In these pictures good invariably triumphs over every evil except moviemaking formula." the director of ���The Force Awakens ��� may not have the makings of a god or an empire builder like George Lucas but he turns out to be what this stagnant franchise needs: a ���Star Wars��� superfan and pop culture savant. Given that the fans have been doing much of the heavy lifting for a while holding up the franchise even as the filmmakers let them down with some titanic clunkers (���Attack of the Clones��� ��� why George why?) it seems fitting that the new film was directed by one of their own. Mr. Abrams was 11 when he saw the original ���Star Wars��� back in 1977; by the time he was a teenager he had a gig cleaning Steven Spielberg���s old student movies." it won���t save the world not even Hollywood but it seamlessly balances cozy favorites ��� Harrison Ford ladies and gentlemen ��� and new kinetic wows along with some of the niceties that went missing as the series grew into a phenomenon most crucially a scale and a sensibility that are rooted in the human. It has the usual toy-store-ready gizmos and critters but it also has appealingly imperfect men and women whose blunders and victories decency and goofiness remind you that a pop mythology like ���Star Wars��� needs more than old gods to sustain it." with Michael Arndt and the ���Star Wars��� veteran Lawrence Kasdan ���The Force Awakens��� takes off with a battle and closes on a meaningful moment of quiet. Mr. Abrams doesn���t pile on the mayhem and for the most part the pace remains fast without being overly frantic. In the inaugural skirmish you can follow Poe Dameron as he darts across the screen; he doesn���t get lost among the shadows and editing a clarity that remains fairly consistent. As for the story well it���s as simple as ever with the usual complications and a bestiary of cute cuddly and loathsome creatures (humanoid and not) with odd names and habits that keep this circus jumping. It���s the old war of all against all with fur and feathers snouts and slapstick and a guest appearance by Oedipus." though the war has dragged on and now Luke Leia and Han have been succeeded by a charismatic talented trio ��� played by Oscar Isaac John Boyega and Daisy Ridley ��� who look more like the multitudes humankind contains a genuine diversity infrequently represented in our movies. Yet while these three are variations on the original holy trinity part of what makes them contemporary isn���t just their skin colors but also the slippery playfulness of their roles. Mr. Isaac as a resistance pilot Poe Dameron suggests a next-generation Han but so does Mr. Boyega as Finn stormtrooper turned refusenik. The one seemingly unambiguous note is that the new-school Luke Skywalker is a young woman a desert scavenger named Rey (Ms. Ridley) who shares Luke���s skill set and love of natural fabrics."

But that queasy empty feeling is the point: This is a terrifically enjoyable movie that leaves you in a state of rage nausea and despair. What is to be done with those feelings is the great moral and political challenge Mr. McKay has set for the audience which I hope is vast and various. I don���t condone mob violence and I���m supposed to keep my political opinions to myself but as soon as I���m done writing this I���m going out to the garage to look for a pitchfork." ��� ���Anchorman 2���) and Charles Randolph and directed by Mr. McKay and released in the midst of ���Star Wars��� advent season the film sets itself a very tall order. It wants not only to explain the financial crisis of 2008 ��� following the outline of Michael Lewis���s best-selling nonfiction book ��� but also to make the dry complex abstractions of high finance exciting and fun. Celebrity cameos (from Margot Robbie Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez among others) are turned into miniseminars on the finer points of credit-default swaps and collateralized debt obligations. The story swerves and swings from executive suites and conference rooms to hectic Manhattan streets and desolate Florida subdivisions. The performances the script and the camera itself seem to be running on a cocktail of Red Bull Adderall and mescaline." when Mr. Lewis���s book came out it was as ubiquitous an accessory for business-class airline passengers as the ���Twilight��� novels were for adolescent girls. Part of the book���s appeal ��� a side effect of its author���s smart breezy plain-spoken style ��� was that it offered readers the illusion of retroactive prescience. You could read about the insanity of bundling subprime mortgages into highly rated investment products and think: Well of course that was a recipe for disaster. Of course a drop in the housing market would bring the whole thing crashing down like a Jenga tower. It was obvious. We knew it all along." intellectual and ethical failures that led to the crisis. J .C. Chandor���s superb ���Margin Call��� (2011) depicts the minute-by-minute bursting of the mortgage-backed-securities bubble while Ramin Bahrani���s excellent ���99 Homes ��� released this year dramatizes some of the long-term consequences of the crash. But rather than rehash familiar ground ���The Big Short��� achieves a fresh and brilliant synthesis of knowing insiderism and populist incitement." for Shipley and Geller to hit pay dirt and for Vennett to earn the right to be smug in perpetuity we are also hoping for ruin to be visited on millions of ordinary people. Houses nest eggs jobs and lives will be lost. Brad Pitt in a gravelly turn as Ben Rickert Shipley and Geller���s paranoid guru makes this point explicitly when he scolds his prot��g��s for celebrating their good fortune. He says what needs to be said but the achievement of ���The Big Short��� is that Mr. McKay doesn���t only underline the moral of the story in dialogue. The film���s final images its abrupt shift in tone from exhilaration to exhaustion its suddenly downbeat music (by Nicholas Britell) all combine to trigger a climactic wave of almost unbearable disgust." Dr. Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a fund manager who sits in his office wearing a T-shirt and flip-flops blasting death metal beating on his desk with drumsticks and betting his client���s money on financial catastrophe. There is the righteously angry crusader Mark Baum (Steve Carell) a disaffected Wall Streeter who sees a similar wager as the perfect expression of his contempt for the big banks (including the one he technically works for). And there are the young indie upstarts Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Geller (John Magaro) college buddies whose ���garage band��� fund was started with their own money and who want to show that they can play in the big leagues." almost none of us did. Certainly not the government officials and banking executives who remain at liberty and in positions of power to this day. Or if they did know they didn���t care. The truth about what the banks and their enablers were doing was obvious only to a handful of people (one of whom in the movie is shown demonstrating the Jenga tower metaphor I just borrowed). Mr. McKay with a comedy writer���s eye for archetypes sorts them into an amusing array of strongly defined characters." as we know ��� and as we can stand from time to time to be reminded ��� there is no happy ending to this story no punishment for the crime. A movie is unlikely to change that and ���The Big Short ��� in many ways a startlingly ambitious film is modest about what it can do. It offers no solutions and no comfort. The best it can do is put down a marker." and serving as our guide to the apocalypse unfolding around them is Jared Vennett a silky cynic played with all the seductiveness that has made him a beloved Internet meme by Ryan Gosling. From time to time Vennett will cast his baby blues toward the camera to tell us that something didn���t really happen in quite the way it���s being shown ��� or that incredibly enough it actually did. His slick winking wit inoculates the movie against excessive earnestness and allows us to think that ���The Big Short��� is going to be one of those boisterous amoral rich-guy movies complete with geysers of Champagne and visits to strip clubs." to some extent it is. Mr. McKay is not above using paid-for female nudity as a signifier of capitalist excess nor acknowledging more generally the hedonistic aspects of greed. He is a naturally exuberant director and his antic energy matches the rhythms of the story. The teams conspiring to short the market are impossible not to root for and the work of the movie���s sprawling ensemble is never less than delightful. (This is the place to appreciate the contributions of Rafe Spall Hamish Linklater and Jeremy Strong who play Baum���s baffled minions; Adepero Oduye who plays his liaison to the bank that houses his fund; and Marisa Tomei who as Baum���s wife is like the only civilian in a combat picture.)"

though is a misbegotten decorousness that sinks the movie stoving it as calamitously as an enraged whale. Whether out of squeamishness Oscar ambitions or because the story never coheres Mr. Howard puts his pulp instincts in check and consistently (tastefully) pulls back deploying splatters rather than torrents. Yet Melville was drawn to the story of the Essex for good reason including the ghastly turn of events that led Mr. Philbrick to drop memorable phrases like ���gastronomic incest��� into his book.

One problem is the obvious artificiality of many of the digital effects. These often take you out of the story partly because unlike the impressionistic painted backdrops in old Hollywood films they���re trying hard to replicate the real world. When a rope runs along a post the heat rising from it looks faked while it���s the grappling men who give the moment a fleeting vibrancy." and the pleasant scratching sound of a quill on paper only goes so far. So it���s understandable that Mr. Howard who���s best when he���s in touch with his B-movie pulp side seems as anxious as Owen to set sail.

That���s too bad but as the movie lurches along by fits and starts toggling between the little Nantucket room and the great watery world it becomes apparent that the filmmakers have no idea how to reconcile not just two parallel stories but also the past and our contemporary age. In one corner there���s the ambitious author hungrily absorbing a tragic tale that will help lead him to a masterpiece; in the other is the old-fashioned adventure story outfitted with manly action churning waters and a catastrophe in the wild that meant something very different in the 19th  century than it does today." the movie pulls a thread from history and tries to weave it into a tapestry. On a Nantucket night in 1850 Herman (a wan Ben Whishaw) blusters into the home of an old seaman Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) who has a story but is in emotional lockdown. Making his case with cash Herman persuades Tom to talk which he does with booze and much actorly harrumphing from Mr. Gleeson. Winding the clock back to 1819 Tom begins the story of the whaling ship the Essex and its first mate Owen Chase a role that once would have belonged to Burt Lancaster and which Mr. Hemsworth plays with a straight-edged seriousness that is among the movie���s virtues." the trickle of movies about nature���s revenge may turn into a deluge. There are oceans already sloshing through ���In the Heart of the Sea ��� the latest from the director Ron Howard about the shipwreck that was an inspiration for Herman Melville���s ���Moby-Dick.��� Epic in ambition it spans decades and miles as it moves from Nantucket to a Pacific whale hunt that pits man (Chris Hemsworth) against Leviathan. It���s at once a biopic and an adventure yarn that with harpoons and ploddingly good intentions turns a story of survival into an ecological cautionary tale." ���In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex.��� Among Mr. Philbrick���s sources are Nickerson���s posthumously published account ���The Loss of the Ship ���Essex��� Sunk by a Whale and the Ordeal of the Crew in Open Boats ��� and Chase���s 1821 book which has an even more charmingly prolix title: ���Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex of Nantucket; Which Was Attacked and Finally Destroyed by a Large Spermaceti-Whale in the Pacific Ocean; With an Account of the Unparalleled Sufferings of the Captain and Crew��� and so on.

Some of the men end up delivering their lines erect which the ancient Athenian players expressed by wearing artificial phalluses. (Somehow I don���t remember that detail from school.)" surreal furious funny and wildly messy the movie sounds like an invitation to defeat but it���s an improbable triumph that finds Mr. Lee doing his best work in years.

What became of Mr. Ellis who died in 1998 won���t be spoiled here but it was in certain ways a very American end to a life that embodied quite a bit about American aspirations." the president of Sun Records had him perform in a mask billed as Orion and sounding like Presley and he developed a passionate following. The film relates the tale through clips interviews and occasional fragments of audio in which Mr. Ellis talks obliquely about the stunt sounding like a reluctant participant." a singer blessed and cursed with a voice that sounded too much like Elvis Presley���s is strange and tragic a piece of musical history that says worlds about the fickleness of fame and ends with a jolt that makes it even sadder.

��� Paolo Sorrentino���s new film is an Alpine resort ��� a picturesque place rich with cultural associations and full of rich cultured guests. Even if most people in the audience have never been to such a spot it may nonetheless ring a few bells and jog some literary and cinematic memories. We���ve been here before. Was it ���The Magic Mountain��� or ���The Grand Budapest Hotel���? ���The Good Soldier���? ���Last Year at Marienbad���?" the film starts to feel like an airline magazine collaboratively produced by the editorial staffs of Playboy and Modern Maturity. The wonder of nature is assumed rather than explored and the psychological insights are narrow and dreary. Artists are men. Women are their muses their objects and their burdens. This notion has always been sexist but it hasn���t always been boring. Can we please move on to the after-party?" friends since way back and easygoing twilight companions. Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) is a prominent composer in semi-retirement his longed-for serenity disrupted by the marital crisis of his daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) and by the attentions of an emissary from the British royal family who wants Fred to conduct a command performance of one of his best-loved works. Meanwhile Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) a filmmaker has gathered a team of young screenwriters to help him cook up what he hopes will be his final masterpiece the capstone of a storied career." in spite of the gorgeous vistas and beautiful naked women. Or actually because of them." even if it too often sounds as if they were speaking lines translated into English. Mr. Sorrentino���s pictorial sense remains exquisite as it was in ���The Great Beauty��� and before that in ���This Must Be the Place��� and ���The Consequences of Love.��� As befits a movie about a composer the music (by David Lang) makes its presence felt in more than a merely decorative manner. It carries the intimation of something deeper and grander into this minor fable of waning potency." to which I was too young to be invited ��� and Mr. Sorrentino concocted a pretty good one a couple of years ago a meditation on stasis and hedonism aptly called ���The Great Beauty.��� That film an Oscar winner set amid a drifting Roman literary and social elite pulled off the nifty trick of combining spiritual emptiness with aesthetic repletion so that you could walk away feeling both starved and satisfied exhilarated and inexpressibly triste. The notable absence of any whisper of Italy���s social economic and political crises was not necessarily a sign of disengagement since the obliviousness of the Italian elite was one of that film���s main themes." ��� the melancholy is more explicit and appears at least on the surface to be individual rather than systemic. And universal rather than tied to any particular facts of geography and history. It���s a movie about getting old which happens to everyone. In the movie���s view of life this happens with special poignancy to men." but they share their rarefied aerie with a movie star (Paul Dano) and a recent Miss Universe (Madalina Ghenea). Lena pursues a romance with a rock climber and other guests involve themselves in sexual and metaphysical shenanigans. The two old pals reminisce about lost loves one of whom shows up briefly and memorably in the person of Jane Fonda." of course. These are highly specific mountains and trees and the people gamboling and gambling in their shadows are exquisite in their individuality. But still.

So long that decline has become its own kind of vigor. On the eve of World War I and in its aftermath aristocrats and artists walked these grounds in tuxedos and evening gowns.

the interpretation���s the thing. The director Justin Kurzel working from a script by Jacob Koskoff Todd Louiso and Michael Lesslie lights a smoldering scene with a broodingly dark palette verdant hills and vales and the pale beautiful face of a dead child on a funeral pyre. Death haunts this place and soon Macbeth the Thane of Glamis is leading his troops to victory on the battlefield the arena that Mr. Kurzel loves best here. Similarly to what Steven Spielberg did in ���Saving Private Ryan��� (and the Wachowskis did in ���The Matrix���) Mr. Kurzel periodically slows down the action allowing every drop of blood and bit of mud to linger." even if beautifying carnage in this manner is distracting and complicated both for what it means for the drama unfolding on screen and for the audience. The slow-motion scenes suggest that there���s a timeless aspect to this slaughter and perhaps by extension an inevitability to such violence. And if war is inevitable and eternal what does this say about Macbeth? Then again the carefully choreographed and filmed violence with its flowing sword-clanging and blood-spurting is kind of cool. You can���t look away even when one warrior draws a blade across another���s throat ��� which may be another reason (or the main one) for this deceleration." Tynan continued immediately contradicting his claim was Laurence Olivier who in a 1955 production ���shook hands with greatness.��� With his Macbeth Mr. Fassbender who routinely shakes hands with greatness in films that don���t remotely do the same produces a man whose anguish eventually becomes a powerful counterpoint to his deeds partly because he���s already dead by the time he utters his first word. Mr. Fassbender gives you a reason to see this ���Macbeth ��� although the writing isn���t bad either." double toil and trouble��� is among the play���s most memorable passages the one with three witches a bubbling caldron and an eye of newt. A gang of weird sisters still roams the foggy Scottish moors periodically speaking in riddles and giving Macbeth the evil eye. Yet the movie mutes the dark magic that swirls in the play an alteration that itself stirs the pot complicating the question of Macbeth���s freedom his will and his guilt." does Macbeth kill Duncan (David Thewlis) because of magic fate or ambition? Or is Lady Macbeth (a mushy-mouthed Marion Cotillard) who bombards her husband with pushy exhortations (man up!) and seductively busy hands to blame? These are the questions that like the fog that Mr. Kurzel keeps pumping into the fray obscure the character and that only Mr. Fassbender���s exceptionally fine performance disperses. Quietly insistently he pulls you to him in scene after scene largely with a restrained intensity that in its near-husbandly closeness creates an intimacy between you and the character effectively turning you into another Lady Macbeth."

Still by the time the boxer Larry Holmes the filmmaker James Toback and the novelist Jeffrey Eugenides are sharing a frame the film has begun to feel like an avant-garde variant of a cameo-laden old-school studio blockbuster like ���The Greatest Story Ever Told.���" Mr. Barney in the role of the Ka of Norman (in ancient Egyptian theology the Ka is a portion of the soul)��� emerges filth-covered from a deep body of water and sewage.

Described by its makers as an opera (much of it is indeed sung) the film uses as its base the life of the author Norman Mailer and the Egyptian characters and rituals described in his 1983 novel ���Ancient Evenings.��� The action such as it is toggles between a long memorial service for Mailer (who died in 2007; he acted in one of Mr. Barney���s ���Cremaster��� pictures in 1999 after which the two became friends) and the enactment of certain Egyptian myths in modern-day settings including Detroit and Los Angeles." until a third act that���s almost an assault.

which is the erasure of the distinction between the literal and the metaphorical. Symbols in this film have a way of crashing to earth and mundane facts take on mysterious meanings.

Art often emerges out of a struggle with the conflicting imperatives of personal expression social engagement and formal experimentation. Artists in the past ��� some mid-19th-century European novelists many mid-20th-century European filmmakers ��� have attempted heroic acts of synthesis. What marks Mr. Gomes as a representative artist of his time is his preference for fragmentation and for an anti-heroic ironic conception of his own artistic identity. ���Arabian Nights��� predicts its own failure.

It���s an anti-masterpiece." ��� called ���The Restless One ��� begins with the filmmaker���s self-mocking confession of impotence and bafflement. We see him fleeing the set his panicked crew chasing after him. (Later as punishment his colleagues will bury Mr. Gomes up to his neck in sand as if preparing to stone him to death.) In a voice-over he lays out his creative predicament. He finds himself both ���in the eye of the storm��� and ���at a dead end ��� pulled between two contradictory desires. He wants to indulge his taste for beauty and fantasy but he also wants to tell the truth about the world and in particular about Portugal at a time of economic and political crisis. Is it possible to satisfy both desires?" ��� the anxious ambitious new film by the Portuguese director Miguel Gomes are nestled inside two distinct frames. One is what the title would lead you to expect: Scheherazade daughter of the grand vizier of Baghdad invents tales to prevent her fearsome new husband the sultan from taking her life. Each vignette in this three-part movie belongs to one of Scheherazade���s 1 001 nights." this section would be a small troubling strangely lyrical film. In the context of the larger project though it loses some of its impact. There is a fine line between delving into the mysteries of life and engaging in mystification and Mr. Gomes lands on the wrong side of it. There is something disingenuous in the way this movie disowns its own ambitions and scorns the possibility of clarity or coherence. Maybe its opacity is a matter of principle. Or maybe it���s just an excuse." ���Arabian Nights��� is less elegant and less coy than Mr. Gomes���s ���Tabu ��� and not as haunting as his ���Our Beloved Month of August.��� Its three parts are being shown in American theaters separately over the next few weeks but while there is little narrative overlap they hardly stand alone. Nor do they really add up. Part 2 ���The Desolate One ��� is where you will find the heaviest concentration of fabulism and soft-core nudity ��� Mr. Gomes is a proud member of the fraternity of directors who persuade women to disrobe in the name of art ��� while Part 3 ���The Enchanted One ��� represents the most extended engagement with contemporary reality. Part 1 has some of each." it may be foolish to expect much of a payoff from this film which makes a virtue of irresolution and indecision. Still it is worth sticking with it until the end since the third part is the most powerful. It consists almost entirely of an exploration of the tradition of trapping and training songbirds which has flourished in some parts of Portugal since the early 20th century. In the middle we hear of a sad love affair between a Portuguese man and a Chinese student narrated in Chinese over images of labor unrest." of course. A note at the beginning of each installment explains that these stories are fictionalized versions of events that occurred in Portugal in 2013 and 2014 as the government adopted austerity measures that squeezed an already demoralized population. Some of the anecdotes have the feel of urban legends arising from a climate of malaise and mistrust. Did you hear the one about the lost dog in the housing project? The outlaw who evaded capture in the mountains? At other times the dislocation of workers and the erosion of middle-class living standards are confronted directly as we hear men and women who are not professional actors testify to their hardships. Occasionally the film will take an allegorical satirical turn notably in a tale about a group of bankers and government ministers who encounter a wizard peddling a magical cure for impotence." a plaything and a structural principle. A lavishly costumed anthology of exotic fables may be the movie he dreams of making but reality keeps distracting him. Or maybe it���s the other way around: His ambition to make a rigorous documentary about the state of the Portuguese working class is continually interrupted by dreams of far-off lands and naked women."

Mr. Civeyrac dabbles in detachment and alienation without digging in. Poking the bear then jumping back he presents random jabs of racial conflict that appear jarringly out of nowhere.

the appropriately named protagonist of ���Christmas Again ��� approaches the holiday season more as he would a duty than an occasion for good cheer. For a brief period each year he ventures from upstate New York to Greenpoint Brooklyn to sell Christmas trees. He stands stoically while customers snap pictures of the firs on their cellphones or pepper him with questions about different evergreens." mood tempo and even suspense.

Whether these two might provide some comfort for each other is the closest that ���Christmas Again��� comes to having a plot." ���Christmas Again��� is concerned with how the holidays are for some a time of lonely resignation. (Sporting a green winter jacket Noel sometimes looks ready to camouflage himself in his merchandise.) The cinematographer Sean Price Williams shoots on 16-millimeter film suffusing the film with wintry colors and at times visible grain. This is a Christmas movie in which magic exists largely on the periphery and that is just the right mix of chilly and sweet." clearly Noel���s ex.

which Mr. Jones lovingly illustrates in dissections of a few of the master���s most memorable scenes. Though merely a tasting menu these moments add jolts of pulpy fun and allow their creator to speak for himself. The man who embraced many of the characteristics that movie snobs love to denigrate ��� his genre; his prolific output (at the time of the interview he was just completing his 48th film); the constraints of the studio system ��� is finally his own best argument for the happy coexistence of art and entertainment." Mr. Jones fashions an unfaltering encomium that���s entirely free of the highfalutin monologues that might deter noncinephiles. Bob Balaban���s intermittent narration is soft and unintrusive and a chorus of lauded directors mostly American and all male (I can���t help thinking that a woman might have dug deeper into the significant contributions of Hitchcock���s wife and collaborator Alma Reville) chime in with acuity and ardor." movie buffs were likely to view Truffaut���s enthusiasm for Hitchcock as a sufficient entree to their discerning fold. But the book an engrossing record of Truffaut���s dayslong interview with his idol in 1962 did more than just reposition its subject���s reputation. It also provided riveting insight into the art and craft of moviemaking revealing Hitchcock���s mastery of time and space and his unwavering preference honed by his period of making silent movies for image over dialogue." an experience that my 7-year-old self was ill-equipped to parse. Surrounded by jittery adults I puzzled over everything and not just the frantic screaming that mimicked Bernard Herrmann���s devilishly clever musical cues. Why I wondered was Janet Leigh wandering around in her bra in the middle of the afternoon?" Kent Jones���s documentary ���Hitchcock/Truffaut��� ��� though not nearly as dry as its title ��� barely tickles Hitchcock���s fascinating fetishes. Despite a promising nod to the brilliant perversions of ���Marnie��� and ���Vertigo��� (which few can deny is one terrifically sick movie) Mr. Jones remains rigidly focused on hammering home the director Fran�_ois Truffaut���s motivation for writing the 1966 book on which this film is based: To lead Hitchcock then widely considered a mere commercial entertainer out of the shoals of populism and into the cineaste spotlight. Truffaut knew that hindsight was better than no sight at all."

His drug habit was soon financed by crime and for some 30 years he was in and out of prison. After his last stint he was released and went on to record some of his finest work." ��� subtitled ���The Frank Morgan Story ��� isn���t a hard-hitting exploration. Though Mr. Morgan���s grittier side is outlined it���s not deeply investigated. (When a former wife says that the only way to love Frank Morgan was to ���live in a state of exasperation ��� you long to hear more about their marriage and his demons.) Instead it���s a fond and forgiving tribute to the man filled with music that moves beyond happy and sad and toward something like brilliance." and later played by his son���s crib.

in contrast acts from the inside out with an openness and spontaneity that is especially rare in movies like this one. Whether she is painting smoking embracing her husband or offering her hand to the woman who replaces him Gerda is the one figure onscreen who seems to breathe the sharp air of reality. The others have been painted with practiced skill and impeccable intentions by numbers." Kyle Buchanan writing for Vulture complained that it was part of a trend of ���queer and trans films that are actually about straight people.��� Not that the emphasis on Gerda���s experience is illegitimate. She is called upon to support the man she loves as he erases himself from her life and Ms. Vikander registers the anguish and ambivalence as well as the passionate loyalty that Gerda feels as Einar gives way to Lili." earnest didactic style ��� magnified by Alexandre Desplat���s decorously overwrought score ��� does the film no favors. And the asymmetry between the central performances doesn���t help either. Mr. Redmayne is a master of technique adept at significant gestures freighted glances and the kind of showiness that masquerades as subtlety. As a result the passage from Einar to Lili is almost entirely a matter of artifice and surface. Einar���s fingers brush against the ballerina���s dresses hanging in Ulla���s studio. Mr. Redmayne alters the angle of his neck the rhythm of his walk the timbre of his voice and the set of his mouth. It���s all very impressive as it was when he traced the progress of Stephen Hawking���s neurological illness in ���The Theory of Everything.��� But like that much-praised performance this one does not take us where we need to go which is inside the character���s mind and spirit." ���The Danish Girl��� is a fictionalized biography of Lili Elbe (as Einar Wegener came to be known) one of the first people to attempt sex reassignment surgery. Lili���s encounters with prevailing medical wisdom culminating in her meeting with a sympathetic doctor (Sebastian Koch) form a harrowing subplot. And her bravery makes this film a welcome tribute to a heroic forerunner of the current movement for transgender rights. It���s impossible not to be moved by Lili���s self-recognition and by her demand to be recognized by those who care most about her." not to be confused with gender. Running time: 2 hours." ��� Tom Hooper���s new film is a story of individual struggle that is also a portrait of a marriage. In this respect and others it resembles ���The King���s Speech ��� Mr. Hooper���s earlier historical drama a multiple Oscar winner a few years ago. In that case the union of George VI and Elizabeth the Queen Mother was the foundation on which the tale of George���s elocutionary striving was built. Here the marriage is bohemian rather than aristocratic but the stakes while personal are every bit as profound and consequential as the matters of state that drove the monarch to the microphone." a more daring and emotionally open exploration of Lili���s emergence. As it is the film like its heroine for most of her life is trapped by conventional expectations and ways of being. If that is Lili is really the heroine at all. The film���s title phrase is uttered on screen once by Einar���s childhood friend Hans (Matthias Schoenaerts) a Paris art dealer in reference to Gerda. And it is Gerda���s ordeal that provides the narrative with its emotional center of gravity." ��� which embeds gender transition in a dense and detailed weave of family relations ���The Danish Girl��� takes place in the airless elegant atmosphere of quality filmmaking. Every scene is wrapped around a neat nub of feeling. The dialogue is carefully balanced between modern sensibilities and the imaginary language of Fancy Old Europe which is really just English spoken in a variety of lovely and heterogeneous accents." played by Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne they seem perfectly matched.

Their best friend Ulla (Amber Heard) a dancer marvels at their mutual devotion which combines the easy egalitarian warmth of friendship with the heat of sexual attraction." Einar discovers that the man the world has always taken him to be is not the person he truly is.
