apparently factual and generally unhelpful subtitle ���The Untrue Story of Monty Python�۪s Graham Chapman.�۝ That more or less takes care of the movie�۪s subject which is either a somewhat or not at all fallacious account of the life of Graham Chapman (born in Britain in 1941) one of the six members of that landmark comedy troupe. Save an absent Eric Idle all of the Pythons contributed vocal talent to the movie including Chapman which is especially impressive given that he died from cancer in 1989." Jeff Simpson and Ben Timlett ���A Liar�۪s Autobiography�۝ consists of close to 20 animated fragments by 14 companies. It�۪s a colorful patchwork of family high and low points schoolboy days professional triumphs and assorted epiphanies (including sex with women followed by sex with men)." generally heavily graphic visual style as befits a professional funnyman the story they tell in aggregate is less formally bold than the overall conceit. Unlike a typical episode of the Pythons�۪ television show (1969-74) say the movie hews to a standard developmental logic: Chapman was born grew up went to school met his future foils and partied to grim excess." also titled ���A Liar�۪s Autobiography�۝ (1980). What does seem true is that he met John Cleese while they were at Cambridge and both went on to work for David Frost. In one section ���Ibiza �۝ an animated Mr. Cleese drawn with delicate lines and with skin as red as a boiled Englishman pedals a two-seater with Chapman perched on the back seat. Together they cycle through excuses to work not at all or only a little. ���I�۪ll sit in the shade with the typewriter �۝ Mr. Cleese says pumping a portentously flat tire ���and you can sit out on the balcony in the sun sunning yourself and shout a few lines in right?�۝" often illustrated with his ubiquitous clenched pipe and faraway smile had a seemingly prosaic youth. The filmmakers using a recording of ���A Liar�۪s Autobiography�۝ by Chapman create a voice-over that tracks his peaks valleys loves losses and laughs over animation of variable expressivity. The resulting portrait is of a vague bookish randy and arch daydreamer whose decision to study medicine took a U-turn when he joined the Cambridge Footlights a comedy troupe whose alumni include Germaine Greer and Sacha Baron Cohen. Chapman and Mr. Cleese both toured with a Footlights revue the Cambridge Circus and later joined with the other future Pythons including Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam to make TV shows albums movies history." including ���The Pythons: Autobiography by the Pythons�۝ (2003) which was released two years before the musical ���Spamalot�۝ hit Broadway. Written by Mr. Idle ���Spamalot�۝ is a popular musical riff on the group�۪s first original feature ���Monty Python and the Holy Grail �۝ one of several of its big-screen successes. Chapman who plays the lead role in ���The Holy Grail �۝ apparently drank through the production but he gave up the bottle (and endured delirium tremens) to play the title role in a later feature ���Monty Python�۪s Life of Brian.�۝ His alcoholism is a theme that winds a bit too lightly throughout the movie of ���A Liar�۪s Autobiography �۝ though one section does skew darkly hallucinatory when bugs scuttle up both of Chapman�۪s arms like flanking armies." rancorous troupe moments interspersed throughout the Pythons�۪ 2003 ���Autobiography �۝ including Mr. Cleese�۪s decision to leave it partly because of he says Chapman�۪s drinking. Mr. Cleese�۪s participation in the ���Liar�۪s Autobiography�۝ movie suggests that time may have eased his hurt or maybe that the remaining Pythons are engaging in legacy building." Mr. Idle who says in ���The Pythons: Autobiography�۝ that an inebriated Chapman bullied him certainly has his reasons for keeping away. But his absence is felt in this group effort which squeezes its biggest laughs from its many squawking strangulated vocalizations. These are the silly voices that however tempered by age remind you why the Pythons were so completely different."

���In Another Country�۝ is at once a comedy of manners and an oblique commentary on the power of cinema to expose and alter reality. Its three chapters each a little under a half-hour long are scenarios dreamed up by an aspiring young screenwriter (Jung Yumi) in the midst of some vague family trouble. The movies she writes which we see enacted on the screen (with Ms. Jung as a helpful neighbor) are variations on some of Mr. Hong�۪s favorite themes: social awkwardness sexual frustration and the selfishness of Korean men." who finds herself the only foreigner in an overcast beach town. Whether she is a filmmaker the lover of a filmmaker (Moon Sungkeun) or a newly divorced spiritual seeker she finds herself entangled in an odd group dynamic made more so by her cultural and linguistic estrangement. Whatever the situation she attracts the clumsy infatuated attention of a lifeguard (Yu Junsang) with whom she communicates in halting half-shouted English." whose relationship is unsettled by Anne�۪s presence. Anne is not precisely the same person each time. Her clothes and hair are a bit different as is her temperament: coy when she wears red reckless and abrasive in green. The others are sometimes rude sometimes solicitous and variously puzzled exasperated and charmed by her presence." which is never less than moderately interesting but only intermittently more. Mr. Hong�۪s playful formal ingenuity is evident in the way certain shots scenes and events are repeated with small but significant alterations. He ��� or his alter ego the fledgling writer ��� is pleased to show us how much he can do with a strictly limited set of elements. We notice patterns and motifs without worrying too much about the structure that governs them. Our job is not to interpret things like the repeated theft or borrowing of an umbrella or the way certain scenes echo one another but rather to notice that these things are there." and Mr. Hong�۪s fondness for sudden pans and zooms that call attention to the presence of his camera contrasts with the ordinariness of the setting and the unaffected naturalism of the performances. He is interested neither in conventional realism ��� he drifts further away from it with each film ��� nor in equally conventional displays of self-consciousness but rather in staging collisions between those two styles. A movie may be a representation of the world but it is also something that happens in the world which means that sustaining a cinematic illusion and breaking it are equally beside the point." one of the most adventurous actresses in movies the opportunity to try something new. And that might be enough."

�۝ but the venomous passions remain repellently seductively familiar. Bankrolled by Chinese money and directed by a South Korean filmmaker Jin-ho Hur this Chinese-language version of the 18th-century French novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos opens in Shanghai in 1931 when the city was known as the Paris of the Orient. (Now it�۪s just the center of the world.) That year a fighting-trim Mao Zedong helped create the Chinese Soviet Republic and Japan invaded the Chinese province of Manchuria setting up a puppet government. The second Sino-Japanese war was six years away." �۝ which mostly unfolds as a divertingly lush tear-stained melodrama. Written by Yan Geling it follows the overall streamlined contours and devious intrigues familiar from Stephen Frears�۪s 1988 film of the Christopher Hampton stage adaptation. Once again a suave rake Xie Yifan (Jang Dong-gun wearing a Clark Gable smirk and �۪stache) spends his nights busily bedding the local talent and his days sharing gossip with a female counterpart Mo Jieyu (Cecilia Cheung). They are effectively the Shanghai match of Laclos�۪s Vicomte de Valmont and Marquise de Merteuil the twinned vipers who while nestled in the bosom of the city�۪s high society conspire to seduce conquer and destroy their prey." Xie and Mo�۪s conquests seem very helpless and very doomed. Shortly after the movie opens Mo is pointing Xie toward a new target the virginal Beibei (Candy Wang) a giggler in knee socks. Xie�۪s gaze lingers over a widow Du Fenyu (Zhang Ziyi) but Beibei proves the bigger prize because she and her virginity have been promised to a power broker. From how she flutters her lashes at her art teacher Dai Wenzhou (Shawn Dou behind a curtain of boy-band hair) Beibei appears eager to learn the ways of the flesh. Those plotting to help in her education feed the drama as does the question of whether they will land triumphantly vertical or broken on the bed of their own destruction." and as the history of Hollywood shows stories about pretty people behaving badly remain reliably alluring. How such beauties go rancid and why changes from decade to decade and it�۪s worth pointing out that Mr. Hampton�۪s play and Mr. Frears�۪s adaptation both landed in the 1980s during the Thatcher and Reagan eras. This ���Dangerous Liaisons�۝ carries a suggestion of contemporary commentary too. As chanting protesters take to the streets waving placards and shouting praise about China the film�۪s decadent lovelies remain singularly oblivious to the political tremors starting to shake their world. Given how fast almost eagerly Mr. Hur turns to his story�۪s glossy charms audiences may not notice those tremors either." despite a few choices that look as out of time as Mr. Dou�۪s Bieber-esque swoop. Mr. Hur seems content simply to polish his film�۪s luxurious facade particularly with close-ups that loom like billboards for powdered cheeks and glossy hair. As the players and stakes shift there�۪s little evidence of the emotional texture that Mr. Frears brought to his film and certainly none of the pop culture savvy that fizzed up ���Cruel Intentions �۝ a telling of the tale with high schoolers. But when Zhang Ziyi weeps her tremulous heart-shuddering performance sends cracks across the film and you grasp that the movie�۪s meaning never existed only on its surface but also in what lies beneath."

Goggle-eyed and clenched trapped in an anonymous concrete desert where transport is scarce and utilities unreliable Tommy finds solace in a warmhearted hospice nurse (Wunmi Mosaku) and therapy to modify his flinching body language. But when the fiendish imps ��� all wearing identical hoodies ��� return to claim his daughter Tommy discovers there�۪s more to their viciousness than a lack of parental supervision." ���Citadel�۝ occasionally veers into ludicrousness especially with the introduction of an angry priest (James Cosmo) who turns out to have a connection to the murderous minors. But this spare first feature from the Irish filmmaker Ciaran Foy (drawing on his own experiences) has an atavistic pulse evoking a decaying society where elevators fail and bus drivers cower behind mesh grills. Steeped in the fear of poverty the film prompts us to wonder what�۪s gestating in those low-income tower blocks: feral monsters or economically deprived delinquents? Its mind is already made up." deadly syringes and deformed juniors."

I am an enthusiastic admirer of Mr. Vall̩e�۪s semi-autobiographical 2005 film ���C.R.A.Z.Y �۝ which won several Genie awards (the Canadian Oscar) including best picture but was hardly seen in the United States.

Its mysticism suggests a much less bombastic echo of the 1998 Robin Williams mush fest ���What Dreams May Come �۝ crossed with Krzysztof Kieslowski�۪s more cerebral ���Double Life of Veronique.�۝" who also has Down syndrome. It is love at first sight for these 7-year-olds who form an attachment so intense they have to be physically pried apart by the jealous Jacqueline." �۝ although handsomely filmed and convincingly acted goes increasingly off track the more it concentrates on Carole a sleepwalker with premonitory dreams who is so troubled that she consults a medium. As the two stories come together around the theme of interlocking destinies with suggestions of reincarnation the movie floats into the ozone." the more frenetic its editing and the multipronged story that alternates between Montreal and Paris becomes a deluge of crosscut fragments that jump around so frantically that ���Caf̩ de Flore�۝ feels less like a movie than like a cinematic jigsaw puzzle whose agitation undermines the very continuity it wants to portray." it doesn�۪t descend into cheap sentimentality.

a German-born 18th-century physician and martyr for liberty is well known to schoolchildren in Denmark. Analogies are imperfect ��� this critic�۪s mastery of Danish history even more so ��� but Struensee who died a few years before the start of the American Revolution might be compared to Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin. Like other eminent figures of the Age of Reason he was both a politician and a man of science a philosopher and what we might nowadays call a player." fighter thinker and schemer ��� that is the portrait that emerges in ���A Royal Affair �۝ an Advanced Placement bodice-ripper directed by Nikolaj Arcel. Struensee played with an intriguing blend of dash and gloom by Mads Mikkelsen is depicted with a reverence touched by slightly envious admiration. This guy not only reformed the Danish legal code and pushed a backward nation toward the light of modernity. He also slept with the queen!" but the collision of Enlightenment notions of liberty and aristocratic habits of libertinism seems to have made it inevitable. Also the lovely lonely Queen Caroline Mathilda (Alicia Vikander) happened to be married to a childish obnoxious ninny: His Majesty Christian VII (Mikkel Boe Folsgaard). Struensee serves devotedly as the young monarch�۪s adviser tutor and confidant filling his head with radical French ideas between visits to the queen�۪s chambers." to the rule of law and the supremacy of reason ��� it is in almost every way a decidedly old-fashioned film. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Stately stagy expositions of history have their place in the world of entertainment and the acting is both solid and agile communicating the feelings of passionate people in a passionate time." excessive length and the tendency to read history as a set of moral diagrams. The reactionary prudes who control the Danish court before Struensee arrives (their leader Guldberg is played by David Dencik) are caricatures of authoritarian villainy scheming to destroy Struensee and hypocritically condemning him for immorality." whose maturation is the real arc of the story. ���A Royal Affair�۝ suffers from the richness of the historical material ��� there is so much going on here ��� and also perhaps from a patriotic desire to treat it reverently. Unfortunately it never fully comes to life."

it was tough to picture what he could do for an encore. Zip line into the next European summit meeting with Angela Merkel tucked under his arm? Wrestle nude on the frozen banks of the Volga with Vladimir Putin? Turning Britain�۪s royal octogenarian into a Bond girl was a stroke of cross-marketing genius that profited queen and country both while also encapsulating the appeal of the 007 brand in the age of aerial drones." to borrow somewhat perversely a phrase from Graham Greene who worked for Britain�۪s foreign intelligence agency MI6. In his novel ���The Human Factor �۝ about a double agent Greene sought he said to portray the British secret service unromantically with ���men going daily to their office to earn their pensions.�۝ Bond is wearing a silver-gray suit when he powers into ���Skyfall �۝ the latest 007 escapade but it isn�۪t cut for office work. The suit is seductively tight for starters and moves like a second skin when Daniel Craig in his third stint as Bond races through an atavistic opener that ��� with bullets buzzing and M (Judi Dench) whispering orders in his ear ��� puts him back on mortal yet recognizably Bondian ground." given that he looked as if he were on the Bataan Death March in his last film ���Quantum of Solace.�۝ Directed by a surprisingly well-equipped Sam Mendes ���Skyfall�۝ is in every way a superior follow-up to ���Casino Royale �۝ the 2006 reboot that introduced Mr. Craig as Bond. ���Skyfall�۝ even plays like something of a franchise rethink partly because it brings in new faces and implies that Bond like Jason Bourne needed to be reborn. The tone is again playful and the stakes feel serious if not punishingly so. This is a Bond who after vaulting into a moving train car pauses to adjust a shirt cuff a gesture that eases the scene�۪s momentum without putting the brakes on it." no less ��� suggests that this may be very much like your granddaddy�۪s Bond even without the bikinied backdrop. From the initial sequence one of those characteristic supersize set pieces that precede the opening credits Mr. Mendes shows that he�۪s having his fun with 007. The opening doesn�۪t just take place in Turkey one of those putatively exotic locales adorned with woven carpets and dark-complexioned extras it also includes smoothly choreographed mayhem in both a crowded bazaar and outdoor market. There amid these familiar action-cinema signposts Bond and another agency operative the suitably named Eve (Naomie Harris) chase down a baddie as locals and oranges scatter." though you have to wonder if Mr. Mendes and the writers Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan have folded some 007 arcana into the mix. Turkey plays a major role in the second often most critically celebrated Bond film ���From Russia With Love �۝ which like this one includes a lethal fight on a train a formidable blond male adversary and an island headquarters. But whether the filmmakers want to intimate that this is the rightful follow-up to the rebooted Bond is less interesting than this type of longitudinal thinking the movies inspire." one that Mr. Mendes nicely capitalizes on is that they have made all of us Bondologists. We each have favorite Bonds (Sean Connery for me followed by Mr. Craig) our preferred 007 women outlaws slick gizmos sweet rides command centers and double entendres. We know what kind of cocktail Bond savors and whom he works for and that he often behaves more like a killer than a tradecraft wizard. We also know that like the cowboy�۪s six-shooter and horse Bond�۪s gun and sports car are genre givens as is a sizable body count. And while over the years there have been cruel suave and silly Bonds there is always only one Bond James Bond. The movies have schooled us well." a British film and theater director whose dubious screen achievements include embalming the American dream in ���Revolutionary Road �۝ gets Bond just right in a story that first turns on a domestic threat and then on a personal one. Mr. Mendes grasps the spy�۪s existential center as typified by the ritualistic mano a mano grappling that almost every action movie now deploys to signal that when push comes to punch the hero can still kill with his bare hands. There�۪s brutal death here but there�۪s also a pervading sense of mortality that makes the falling bodies register a little longer than they sometimes do in a Bond movie. As a director of films like ���American Beauty�۝ and ���Away We Go�۝ Mr. Mendes has indulged in a noxious blend of self-seriousness and condescension. There�۪s none of that here." pretty women and silky villainy along with the little and big bangs. Whether Mr. Mendes is deploying an explosion or a delectable detail he retains a crucially human scale and intimacy largely by foregrounding the performers. To that end while ���Skyfall�۝ takes off with shock-and-awe blockbuster dazzle it�۪s opulent rather than outlandish and insistently progressively low-key despite an Orientalist fantasy with dragons and dragon ladies. As Bond sprints from peril to pleasure Mr. Craig and the other players ��� including an exceptional wittily venal Javier Bardem a sleek Ralph Fiennes and a likable Ben Whishaw ��� turn out to be the most spectacular of Mr. Mendes�۪s special effects." if mostly bloodless violence."

�۝ a brand-new Walt Disney feature unites child-friendly 3-D animation with video games. This will strike many parents as a consummation devoutly to be dreaded akin to a sentence of consecutive birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese�۪s. Scholars of corporate pop-culture synergy on the other hand will wonder what took so long since between them the kiddie-cartoon and joystick rackets account for untold billions of dollars in revenue. The merchandising potential is limitless! In either case the movie invites a measure of cynicism ��� which it proceeds to obliterate with a 93-minute blast of color noise ingenuity and fun." mass-produced playthings to imagine them with inner lives in some ways richer than our own. ���Wreck-It Ralph�۝ attempts a similar feat with the pixilated avatars that shoot scamper and zoom across our various interactive screens. In some ways this represents an easier cognitive leap since those characters already possess rudimentary personalities along with the ability to move and make sounds." but can we ever really love them?" from a screenplay by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee ��� answer this question by appealing first of all to nostalgia to the affection parents feel for games that evoke their childhoods. Woody and Buzz Lightyear were to some degree baby boomer throwbacks and Ralph and some of his companions similarly recall the golden age of Generation X arcade play the 1980s of Pac-Man and Centipede and Donkey Kong." a lumbering giant with huge hands an appetite for destruction and the voice of John C. Reilly has toiled for 30 years as the ���bad guy�۝ in a game called Fix-it Felix Jr. Every time a quarter drops into the slot he smashes up an apartment building until it is repaired and he is routed by Felix a twerpy goody two-shoes voiced by Jack McBrayer." which cleverly toggles between its own rather conventionally bigheaded smooth-featured character design and the variously crude fanciful and realistic styles that the players would see. When the arcade is closed the characters are able to travel outside and between their native games a conceit that makes possible some good jokes a handful of geek-friendly references and cameos ��� nice that Q*Bert gets a shout-out ��� and a hectic multilevel plot." like any true Disney animated hero undergoes an identity crisis. Treated as a pariah by his colleagues in Fix-it Felix Jr. ��� even though he�۪s just doing his job ��� he sets out to become a hero in another game risking a breach of protocol that is known (for reasons that would be a spoiler to explain) as ���going Turbo.�۝ In a violent first-person shooter game where heavily armored warriors mow down rampaging insects he encounters a tough commander named Calhoun (Jane Lynch) who will serve as a romantic foil for Felix and as an emblem of gender parity in a usually boy-centric imaginative universe." and not only because the main gamer ��� an eager mostly silent surrogate for the audience ��� is a girl. Ralph�۪s main field of battle is a car-racing game called Sugar Rush which unfolds in a hallucinatory Hello Kitty candy land with more gumdrops than guns. There he meets his fellow outcast and obligatory sidekick a sharp-tongued pixie named Vanellope von Schweetz. She compensates for her cloying name by channeling the voice (and therefore at least by implication the sensibility) of Sarah Silverman." and ��� this being an animated Disney feature ��� the outcome is hardly in doubt. But perhaps because the mood of the movie is so relentlessly playful and kinetic its bouts of sentimentality feel refreshing not forced." thrilling and just a bit exhausting. The secret to its success is a genuine enthusiasm for the creative potential of games a willingness to take them seriously without descending into nerdy pomposity.

It�۪s a beguiling and puzzling line ��� wouldn�۪t you know if you were home or not? ��� and one that suits Cheyenne a retired rock star played with consummate oddness and utter sincerity by Sean Penn." an American singer whose big moment was sometime in the �۪80s (a decade to which his gravity-defying jet-black hair pays vivid and tireless tribute) lives in Dublin in a modernized castle with his wife Jane (Frances McDormand) and their dog. Cheyenne and Jane who works as a firefighter have an easy affectionate sexually lively relationship. Cheyenne has a handful of friends ��� including a moody Goth girl played by Eve Hewson whose father is the real-life Dublin rock star Bono ��� but there is nonetheless something out of place about him an aura of sorrowful estrangement that is not just a matter of appearance." with bright red lipstick dark eyeliner and a deathly pallor dragging a shopping cart behind him Cheyenne looks as if he could be the great-aunt of Edward Scissorhands. His voice ��� high whispery and fussily precise ��� confirms the impression of a post-punk bad boy who grew up into a kooky old lady." partly out of awareness of his celebrity and partly out of a general tolerance for eccentricity. For a while ���This Must Be the Place�۝ has a low-key local comic vibe that recalls the sharp genial �۪80s comedies of the Scottish director Bill Forsyth (like ���Gregory�۪s Girl�۝ and ���Local Hero�۝) albeit with the bright colors flamboyant camera movements and emphatic compositions that are Mr. Sorrentino�۪s hallmarks. But then it turns into something else ��� or rather a bunch of other things among them a road movie a Holocaust drama and an epic tale of prodigal sons and vanished fathers." in which surrealism becomes a form of verisimilitude in its own right. ���The Consequences of Love�۝ (2004) traced the fate of a seemingly unexceptional heroin-addicted businessman with Mafia entanglements. Mr. Sorrentino�۪s masterpiece thus far may be ���Il Divo�۝ (2009) a nothing-but-warts portrait of Giulio Andreotti one of the most powerful and enigmatic political figures in postwar Italy. That film was hyperbolic garishly theatrical and rigorously faithful to the historical record ��� completely unbelievable and pretty much all true." for one thing and one that expresses the kind of fascination with exotic American landscapes that you find in Wim Wenders�۪s ���Paris Texas �۝ Wong Kar-wai�۪s ���My Blueberry Nights �۝ and in ���Borat.�۝ It is also less abrasive than most of Mr. Sorrentino�۪s work. The plot turns are playful as well as jolting and the visual shocks are gentle: a bison on the porch the world�۪s largest pistachio Mr. Penn in his makeup." playing himself and graciously receiving passionate envious tribute from his fictional fellow musician. A phone call summons Cheyenne to New York (by ocean liner since he is afraid to fly) where his father an Orthodox Jewish Holocaust survivor has died. In his diaries the father had recorded his obsession with a German death-camp guard who tormented him and his son resolves to find the man and take revenge." in hindsight to smooth this film out into a more conventional version of itself or to find fault with the tangents and loose ends that it generates along the way. Maybe beneath the stylistic flourishes and bursts of operatic emotion it is a simple story of psychological struggle about a man in midlife reckoning with the damage of his past. But to settle on that interpretation is to deny or discount the splendid strangeness of Mr. Sorrentino�۪s vision ��� and also therefore of the curious corners of reality he discovers along the way." but not much in the way of sex drugs or even rock �۪n�۪ roll."

the bottle looks so very big for something so small like a totem of some mystical deity. It represents a million earlier drinks downed in a forlorn existential frenzy but it also resonates with a foreboding that the director Robert Zemeckis sustains for several unsettling seconds.

And you�۪re dying a little along with him." down down is Whip Whitaker.

Whip doesn�۪t drink to excess and quietly fade he stumbles shouts flails blacks out.

The coordinated chaos makes a sharp contrast with the movie�۪s equally pivotal low-key opener which introduces Whip as he groggily wakes in a hotel room swigs some booze and leers at the naked woman Katerina (Nadine Velazquez) bent over next to him. It�۪s initially amusing to see Mr. Washington who excels at square-jaw decency getting down and dirty." using his restless cameras the pinpoint editing and seemingly nonchalant performances to home in on details that will register more meaningfully later like the hunger with which Whip looks at Katerina and the anger edging his voice as he talks to his ex-wife on the phone. Nothing in the scene registers as especially significant until amid the chatter and subtly choreographed bodies and cameras you learn that Whip is a pilot scheduled to fly that same morning. This bombshell doesn�۪t fully explode though until he leans over a line of coke and with his head swooping straight at us ��� and the camera racing away from him just as fast ��� snorts it punctuating the hit with an ecstatic shake of his head the whites of his eyes shining." and you may be too lifted by the contact high that great filmmaking gives you. Mr. Zemeckis is far from a reliable filmmaker. What he has are good pop-culture instincts and at least until he became infatuated with motion-capture technology a gift for harnessing technological innovations with stories that can turn into enlivening cinema as he did in movies like ���Who Framed Roger Rabbit�۝ and segments of the ���Back to the Future�۝ trilogy. His infatuation with motion capture by contrast has produced a handful of dreary animated experiments like���The Polar Express.�۝ To watch Mr. Zemeckis working fluidly in consort with Mr. Washington�۪s ferocious performance is to regret this director�۪s last technologically determined decade." the controlled movement both conveys the contained frenzy of the scene and visually echoes the chill racing along your spine. Here he achieves more than virtuosic display. By something more I don�۪t mean the movie�۪s subject which is at its broadest a tail-spinning alcoholic. Superficially ���Flight�۝ is the sort of award-season entry that earns plaudits simply because its subjects are sanctified as important serious. There�۪s seriousness in ���Flight �۝ but not self-seriousness. And what distinguishes it is the balance of its parts and how its floating racing cameras complement the nimble performances rocking emotions and ups and downs of the story and music alike." Mr. Zemeckis seems almost to blow it right at the start when he begins abruptly cutting between Whip and a willowy seemingly unrelated redhead. She�۪s soon introduced as the drug addict Nicole who will become important to Whip yet in her twitchy establishing scenes of buying and shooting dope she feels like a miscalculation. Mr. Zemeckis�۪s penchant for matchy-matchy musical selections is similarly distracting as with his use of the Cowboy Junkies�۪ version of the Lou Reed song ���Sweet Jane �۝ when Nicole injects heroin so strong that it�۪s called the Taliban. Mr. Zemeckis may want to suggest that the song ��� its lyrics include ���heavenly wine and roses/seem to whisper to me/when you smile�۝ ��� is playing in her head or ours when she slides the needle in but it�۪s a crude stroke." and there are other instances when Mr. Zemeckis dilutes his movie�۪s power notably with broad comedy and predictable sermonizing. ���Flight�۝ is of course about survival and not only the type promised by the somewhat misleading advertising which focuses on the more shocking (and cinematic) nose-diving calamity instead of the bottle-tipping one. To that end the story hits many familiar recovery beats partly because transformation is the only way out when a star plays an addict in an American mainstream movie. Our national culture of resurrection has as great a stranglehold on movies as Hollywood narrative conventions do. (That partly explains the limited popular appeal of Paul Thomas Anderson�۪s ���Master �۝ in which deliverance remains insistently out of reach.)" as Mr. Washington does brilliantly here. Most charm up their villains thinning the venality with charisma and winks at the camera; in ���Training Day �۝ as a seductively corrupt cop Mr. Washington�۪s magnetism made a mockery of the story�۪s moral posturing. There�۪s no such falsity in ���Flight.�۝ The inevitable redemption doesn�۪t erase what happened or ease the pain and the performance remains astonishingly true to Whip�۪s harrowing aloneness and its cost. Once again you can�۪t take your eyes off Mr. Washington but this time you watch him with agony rather than just admiration." as well as excessive drinking drug use and the usual adult language."

Without passion a performance no matter how impeccable is just a technical feat." high-strung artists must put aside their disagreements to work toward a common goal of seamless unity.

Beethoven�۪s Quartet in C sharp minor (Op. 131) is a tumultuous 40-minute string quartet whose seven movements are to be played without a pause. The ravishing version heard in the film belongs to the Brentano String Quartet whose recording is piercingly intense.

Robert�۪s wife Juliette (Ms. Keener) the group�۪s violist who is very close to Daniel disparages her husband�۪s ambition and her insensitively worded criticisms drive him into such a fury that he has a one-night fling with his sometime jogging partner (Liraz Charhi)." and when Juliette discovers his betrayal she is struck to the quick. Nobody imbues the role of wronged wife with more disdainful loathing than Ms. Keener. She directs a deadly expressionless gaze at Robert who can barely control his emotions once his demons are unleashed." Alexandra (Imogen Poots) who has just begun to live on her own in Manhattan. Alexandra acts out her long-simmering rage at her parents�۪ neglect over the years by impulsively initiating an affair with Daniel. Ms. Poots is scary as this embittered rebellious diva in training. Daniel�۪s sudden abject acquiescence to Alexandra whom he has been shown tormenting with his disapproval is a shock until you realize that he is even more bottled up than Robert." once aired threatens to become a philosophical war over the group�۪s direction waged between a control freak and a free spirit. And the screenplay by Mr. Zilberman and Seth Grossman persuasively argues both sides." covering all the emotional bases before coming to rest. With less sensitive performances this hothouse flower of a film might have seemed stiffly programmatic.

Directed by the hip-hop impresario turned would-be auteur RZA (a k a Robert Diggs) of the group Wu-Tang Clan ���Iron Fists�۝ is a sweetly sincere lightly cheeky gloss on the film genre wuxia (���martial chivalry�۝) and those entertainments known for their flying swordsmen (and women) crouching tigers hidden dragons and often fabulous hair gowns and wirework. This is a movie as drenched in genre love as it is in the arterial spray from its hordes of sliced and diced characters." and really there seems little point in doing so. Once upon a time so-called respectable films opened in certain theaters and the putative dross of the type churned out by the producer Samuel Z. Arkoff opened elsewhere. Those divisions between high and low are long gone demolished by vanguard directors like Dennis Hopper and more recently by filmmaker-pasticheurs like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez who draw on exploitation cinema as enthusiastically as they do on classic Hollywood and art film. The apex of their geek fandom was Mr. Tarantino�۪s ���Death Proof�۝ and Mr. Rodriguez�۪s ���Planet Terror �۝ which were packaged in the United States as a double feature titled ���Grindhouse.�۝" like those films the progeny of a deep cinephile passion if rather shakier filmmaking skills. Shot in China though as supremely artificial-looking as a Hollywood (or Hong Kong) backlot it mostly takes place in a fictional feudal town Jungle Village at the juncture of King Hu and Sergio Leone filmmakers whose shadows loom heavily over the movie. It�۪s here that Western name actors notably Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu rub elbows and clashing accents with Asian talent like Daniel Wu and Gordon Liu in a knotted story involving the usual mad grab for power and gold. Lucy Liu plays Madam Blossom who runs a flamboyantly amusingly smutty pinked-up brothel packed with smiling lovelies who look like an Orientalist fantasy by way of Victoria�۪s Secret." RZA has cast himself as the narrator and story hub a character known with a touch of wit only as the Blacksmith. A hardworking soul the Blacksmith makes weapons for the local warring clans squirreling away his money so that he can leave town with Lady Silk (Jamie Chung). The Blacksmith�۪s pungent history ��� told in flashback and buoyed by a brief appearance from Pam Grier ��� could itself be spun off into a separate movie. It�۪s an obviously pivotal role that should have real juice. But RZA with his sleepy eyes and an affect so laid-back it�۪s a wonder he can remain standing for minutes at a time is too recessive a screen presence to make the character pop much less hold your interest." he has tapped some professional scene stealers including Mr. Crowe and a diverting ByronMann as Silver Lion a gaudy baddie with heavy-metal hair and a psycho grin. Mr. Crowe who swans about as a rogue called Jack Knife looks amused throughout and it�۪s no wonder since about all he has to do is bed multiple women and gut an occasional foe in a movie that can feel like a private party. Which in some ways it is: Ms. Liu and Mr. Liu appeared in Mr. Tarantino�۪s epic ���Kill Bill �۝ to which RZA contributed music. Mr. Tarantino has returned the favor by lending his brand to ���Iron Fists�۝ as its ���presenter.�۝ RZA wrote the movie�۪s screenplay with Eli Roth of ���Hostel�۝ franchise notoriety who appeared as the bat-wielding American soldier in Mr. Tarantino�۪s ���Inglourious Basterds.�۝" after all."

When well-dressed clean-cut Dublin fans rush the stage knocking down equipment and scrapping with police officers it is hard not to see an omen of the lethal mayhem of Altamont in 1969." though what you see is the intensity of rock �۪n�۪ roll at a time when it still felt risky and thrilling. The music is simple disciplined and powerful and its impact on the screaming masses may seem disproportionate to the art. In interviews band members ruminate on the strangeness of it all ��� the power they have over the audience and also the distorting effects of stardom on their lives ��� and Mr. Jagger expresses amazement that they have lasted so long. There is no false modesty in his observation: then as now pop careers could be as brief as mayflies�۪ lives. But time was on their side."

�۝ a new film by Lorraine L̩vy shares its premise with ���The Prince and the Pauper�۝ and Shakespeare�۪s ���Comedy of Errors �۝ though its mood is more melodramatic than humorous. The idea of infants switched at birth each growing up as somebody else is an old and potent one in literature. The possibility of such a mix-up happening in real life evokes both fascination and horror and raises stark primal questions of identity. Is who you are determined by the genetic fingerprints of your biological inheritance or by the influence of your environment?" Yassin (Mehdi Dehbi) and their families who live on opposite sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide. Joseph is the dreamy artistic son of a high-ranking Israeli officer (Pascal Elb̩) and a French-born doctor (Emmanuelle Devos) emerging from a cozy privileged adolescence and preparing for his own military service. A routine blood test shows that he cannot be his parents�۪ child and further investigation reveals that their baby ��� Yassin that is ��� has been reared by an Arab couple (Areen Omari and Khalifa Natour) on the West Bank." the lessons of ���The Other Son�۝ are not hard to guess. The film is propelled by a hopeful good-hearted humanism and it sets out to show that in spite of political religious and cultural divisions people are people." no one can really argue with this but beneath the gentle optimism of the movie is an undercurrent of despair. The chasm between ordinary middle-class Israeli Jews and their Palestinian counterparts is so wide ��� or more concretely the wall is so high ��� that it takes an extreme almost preposterous happenstance to bring the two sides together." �۝ says Yassin to Joseph looking at their reflections in a mirror after the two have become friends. This is not the only reminder that the Middle East conflict is in many ways a family quarrel. The young men�۪s households are virtual mirror images of each other. Their fathers ��� the main who raised Yassin is a music-loving auto mechanic trained as an engineer ��� are quiet solitary men neither one quite able to deal with the revelations about their sons. The mothers in contrast find ways to express their pain and confusion and also discover the capacity to love both of the children they now share." which is the French language. Joseph�۪s mother was born in France as were her husband�۪s parents and Yassin has been studying in Paris where he plans to attend medical school. This is not merely a convenient coincidence. ���The Other Son�۝ is at its best when it is most like a French movie which is to say more interested in the psychological lives and emotional interactions of its characters than in their political circumstances or symbolic significance." preachy tendencies by the skill and sensitivity of the actors who turn a wobbly parable of tolerance into a graceful and touching story of real people in a surreal situation."

Ms. Loktev is highly even morbidly attentive to physical detail to registering the sounds colors and textures of the natural world and the tiniest nuances of human behavior. She also ruthlessly purges her movies of the kind of psychological expression and narrative exposition that most filmmakers depend on. Her stories take place in a vacuum that is also recognizably and palpably the real world." ���Day Night Day Night�۝ (2006) follows a young woman through Midtown Manhattan. She is even more of an abstraction than Alex and Nica: all the viewer knows about her is that she carries a backpack full of explosives and is planning a suicide bombing in Times Square. The documentary background and the camera�۪s unflinching attention to her every step gesture and facial expression both create suspense and induce a kind of philosophical reverie. Who is this person? Why is she doing this? What does it all mean?" �۝ even though the dramatic stakes seem lower. The title evokes a series of guidebooks popular among adventurous travelers and Alex and Nica setting out for a hike in the Caucasus Mountains with a local guide named Dato (Bidzina Gujabidze) seem to fit that profile. They are daring and carefree but not especially reckless and they tramp across a rocky empty landscape with easygoing determination. Occasionally the guide tries to make conversation telling a labored dirty joke or a puzzling anecdote about buying a car." a sense of foreboding and latent violence that Ms. Loktev creates by amplifying ordinary sounds applying small doses of portentous music and cutting abruptly between shots. Something eventually does happen. I can�۪t be more specific partly because I don�۪t want to spoil a surprise and also because the specifics don�۪t necessarily matter." though those are only two of the many possibilities. The episode ��� which lasts a few seconds and is never spoken of afterward ��� might just be a crazy story they will tell at their wedding or something they�۪ll fight about later or forget about entirely." though just as inevitable. Their isolation from each other from us and from Dato is part of the point of the film which is (speaking of paradoxes) aggressive in its subtlety. It is gripping and haunting but also coy and elusive."

jittery beauty to ���Pusher �۝ a very fine British redo of a 1996 Danish movie of the same title. Beauty and drug dealers don�۪t often exist in the same hemisphere. Here though beauty sneaks into neon-streaked streets and reveals itself in a woman�۪s tear-stained face in the shimmering of her sequined dress and at a dance club pulsing with luscious candied colors. This is the world that the dealer Frank (the excellent Richard Coyle) inhabits when he�۪s not racing from one trouble to the next anxiously trying to peddle dope (he calls it gear) and staying out of the gun sights of one scary big fixer." Luis Prieto lets you know that you don�۪t need to see the old ���Pusher�۝ to dig the new. Like the first movie this one revs up with several self-reflexive storytelling devices including a gaudy mildly amusing opener in which the main characters enter striking representative if teasingly exaggerated poses their names splashed on the screen. There�۪s a cartoonish quality to these introductions with Frank�۪s friend Flo (Agyness Deyn) crawling near a stripper pole and his laughing nemesis Milo (a great Zlatko Buric reprising his role and the same tasty villainy) pointing a gun at the camera. Their poses indicate that each has a role to play and they know it as well as you do. See Flo. Crawl Flo crawl. See Milo. Shoot Milo shoot." including the on-screen display of the days of the week (starting with Monday) to suggest that time is running out. It�۪s business as usual though that dawning day with Frank and his sidekick Tony (Bronson Webb) haggling over the price of coke with a dissipated party boy. The buyer�۪s decadence is nicely telegraphed by his lavish digs and picturesquely decayed teeth which contrast with Frank�۪s no-nonsense professionalism. When the buyer comes up short and pleads for a break Frank just scoops out enough coke to make up the difference. Frank may sample his own goods but he manages to stay ahead until he falls disastrously behind." leading to a cascade of oh-so-unfortunate events. It can be difficult to find the right tone or approach in stories about dealers partly because they don�۪t solicit easy sympathy. In Oliver Stone�۪s recent ���Savages�۝ the tale�۪s pot growers are golden boys whose physical attractiveness suggests that they live on Mount Olympus instead of a Southern California beach town. Good looks are a way that filmmakers try to win the audience�۪s support and sometimes a clever way to inoculate characters from criticism. The charismatic gruffly appealing Mr. Coyle with his pouchy eyes and snaky moves serves a similar function in ���Pusher�۝ or so it initially seems and he effortlessly brings you into the story and right alongside him." shuddering close-ups ��� that you have a line on his good and bad choices desires and fears. Frank is more personable than in the earlier version and more shaded morally a complexity mirrored throughout. When a man dies in the first ���Pusher �۝ you notice the room the gun and the splatter. In the remake you see all that (as does Frank) but you also see the man and his trembling and you feel as you should his terror.

Big ideas or at least earnest intellectual conceits crowd the screen along with suave digital effects and gaudy costumes. Free will battles determinism. Solidarity faces off against domination. Belief in a benevolent cosmic order contends with fidelity to the cruel Darwinian maxim that ���the weak are meat the strong do eat.�۝" despite its lofty ambitions can feel like an exercise in number crunching and watching it is a bit like doing a series of math problems in your head.

This is by no means the best movie of the year but it may be the most movie you can get for the price of a single ticket. It blends farce suspense science fiction melodrama and quite a bit more not into an approximation of Mr. Mitchell�۪s graceful and virtuosic pastiche but rather into an unruly grab bag of styles effects and emotions held together just barely by a combination of outlandish daring and humble sincerity. Together the filmmakers try so hard to give you everything ��� the secrets of the universe and the human heart; action laughs and romance; tragedy and mystery ��� that you may wind up feeling both grateful and disappointed." it is also possible to divide the movie into Wachowski and Tykwer halves. Mr. Tykwer�۪s contributions are those that take place closer to the present ��� they concern the composer the journalist and the publisher ��� whereas the Wachowskis leap back to the past and forward into the future. They are less concerned with efficient storytelling than with the maximization of spectacular and intellectual impact with blowing your mind and explaining the cosmos. The Wachowski chapters are bigger grander and noisier while Mr. Tykwer�۪s are tighter funnier and more emotionally resonant. The tale of Frobisher is perhaps the only piece that could stand alone a perfect novella of artistic rivalry sexual misbehavior and poetic despair." however and contrary to the film�۪s design. A major difference between the movie and its source is structural. Mr. Mitchell nests his plots inside one another splitting each one to make room for the others and making his book into something like a set of Russian dolls or a turducken. Mr. Tykwer and the Wachowskis ��� abetted by the heroic editing of Alexander Berner ��� have abandoned this symmetrical literary design opting for the more cinematically manageable technique of crosscutting. The narrative strands are woven together elegantly plaited and quilted at some points tangled and snarled in others. Connective tissue is supplied by music (composed by Reinhold Heil Johnny Klimek and Mr. Tykwer) by voice-overs and visual echoes and also by the reappearance of the same actors in elaborate but nonetheless transparent disguises. Mr. Weaving for example memorably pops up as a devil a Victorian capitalist a sadistic female nurse a corporate-totalitarian bureaucrat and a hit man." sporting facial tattoos and speaking in a futuristic pidgin.

She also appears as Meronym who visits Zachry�۪s island as part of a delegation of technologically advanced researchers. And she is almost unrecognizable as Jocasta Ayrs married to the temperamental maestro played by Jim Broadbent. He is elsewhere a ship�۪s captain and the luckless publisher Timothy Cavendish." in any case a lot of acting here.

Hugh Grant indulges in some sly vulgar villainy with impressive prosthetic teeth and Susan Sarandon floats through a few scenes trailing mists of love and weary wisdom.

It�۪s a path embraced by the wetsuit warriors in ���Chasing Mavericks �۝ a surfing movie about men water and waves and how and why they sometimes come together beautifully and sometimes collide with terrifying force. The movie directed by Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted is based on the true story of a Santa Cruz-area surfer Rick Hesson entertainingly nicknamed Frosty ��� welcome to California people! ��� who back in the day helped shape a legend-to-be: Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston) a boy with a dream and a battered board." home of killing crushing gorgeous monster waves that surge and crash near the coastal city of Half Moon Bay 30 miles south of San Francisco. To judge from all the big-wave surfing movies YouTube clips books blogs competitions and dollars now in circulation he was part of a vanguard. What entices these surfers and looky-loos to Mavericks are waves that become behemoths topping 50 feet giants that owe their size to long swells the continental shelf fault lines reef beds storms and shallow water. According to lore the surf break is named after a German shepherd Maverick. He would follow the surfers who frequented the area in the early �۪60s and like them didn�۪t tackle its biggest waves." by turns seductive and cornball about a master a young grasshopper and the Way of the Wave.

It�۪s who he is to the gentle consternation of his wife Brenda (Abigail Spencer looking like a hippie Sarah Silverman). He has children she reminds him responsibilities. Ms. Spencer beams brightly in a hackneyed role that�۪s part saint part bummer." Frosty isn�۪t the warmest savior though he melts soon enough done in by the boy�۪s yearning. This longing initially revolves around surfing and provides some of the movie�۪s most appealing scenes including ones of Jay hurtling into the waves on a board held together with duct tape. Seven years later and the boy is a teenager slaloming down waves and played by the eager Mr. Weston. (His short blond �۪fro and somewhat distressingly happy-vacant stare may induce flashbacks to William Katt and that classic of surfer movies ���Big Wednesday.�۝) Jay lives to surf though he also works hard both at a pizzeria and at home where he tends to his inattentive often bedridden and depressed mother Kristy (Elisabeth Shue)." but ���Chasing Mavericks�۝ is emphatically upbeat. (It�۪s a co-production of Walden Media which is in the inspiration business.) When the movie works its buoyancy can be infectious and persuasive particularly in the surfing scenes and in the mesmerizing shots of the heaving churning ocean and waves." with its steel blue undulations and the Freudian oceanic feeling it summons. It invites you to gaze into this watery abyss to ponder its mysteries as well as those of the swimmer whose image brackets the movie and evokes John F. Kennedy�۪s observation: ���We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea whether it is to sail or to watch we are going back from whence we came.�۝" keep your eyes on the waves just like the watermen in ���Chasing Mavericks �۝ whose numbers include the surfers Greg Long Peter Mel and Zach Wormhoudt who show up briefly to lend it authenticity and genuine cool. The surfers and the surfing along with the natural beauty of the California coastline help balance the movie�۪s weak areas including its lamentably one-dimensional protagonist. (Mr. Apted took over the last 15 days of shooting after Mr. Hanson left the production for health reasons which may help explain the movie�۪s unevenness.)" the fictionalized Jay tends to drag the story down whether he�۪s smiling moonily at Frosty the ocean or one of the women in his life. He nearly sinks a story that the real Jay Moriarity surfed into legend."

Sprinkled throughout though are involved passages that spin gloriously surrealistically off the narrative rails explaining why Luis Bu̱uel hired Mr. Carri̬re to help write masterworks like ���Belle de Jour �۝ ���The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie�۝ and ���That Obscure Object of Desire.�۝" memories and storytelling ���Le Grand Amour�۝ opens from suitably lofty heights with an aerial view of a city and the sound of a woman singing about love and regret with aching gently jaded knowing. Again and again she sings ���I wait for you �۝ a promise or maybe just a concession that after being repeated a few times starts to sound a wee bit like a threat. Suddenly the scene shifts inside a church where Pierre waits at the altar alongside Florence. The camera then quickly leaves them to trail after some of the others attending the wedding taking snapshots of human moments like a man falling a woman wheezing and a child crying." tagging after this or that person instead of cutting straight to the main attraction. But while the film hinges on Pierre and to a lesser extent Florence their lives are bound up with those around them particularly her parents but also friends employees and passers-by. Pierre dreams of sweet liberation but he does so in a world in which his life his kisses and fights are determined by and performed for other people. Ever so lightly Mr. Etaix evokes the idea that our lives are never our own suggesting notions about ideology very much in circulation in the late 1960s." even in its more wistful interludes. Pierre is repeatedly thwarted yet his imagination his memories and visions free him an emancipation mirrored in the storytelling. The first hint of deliverance appears at the wedding with Pierre in a foreshadowing of his supplication kneeling at the church and then merrily chasing Florence in flashback. ���It had all started badly �۝ he says in voice-over as if contradicting this happy scene. He starts describing his early love life over more flashbacks at one point trying to recall where he met her. He thinks it was on a terrace. ���That�۪s not right �۝ he says. It was ���the Caf̩ de Paris.�۝ You see him at a terrace and a cafe and then a waiter exasperated says ���Make up your mind.�۝" the waiter interrupts Pierre�۪s reminiscences opening up the question of what part of this ramble through time he�۪s making up while waiting to marry. He does wed and for a while seems happy the rhythms of his life echoed by the ticking clocks at home and whirring machines at work. But life or rather a young secretary intrudes throwing him off-kilter and sending him blissfully dreaming including on a runaway bed that ��� as it tools along a country road with two snuggling escapees ��� transforms into a paragon of the Surrealist imagination and a delirious manifestation of that old promising phrase: free love."

I would like to nominate John Hawkes and Helen Hunt in ���The Sessions�۝ as the movie couple of the year. Their extraordinary connection while re-enacting the true story of a disabled virginal 38-year-old writer and his sexual surrogate infuses the movie written and directed by Ben Lewin with a piercing depth of humanity and no small amount of humor." the brilliant chameleonic actor lauded for his sinister portrayals of a backwoods meth dealer in ���Winter�۪s Bone�۝ and of a Charles Manson-like cult leader in ���Martha Marcy May Marlene �۝ plays Mark O�۪Brien a poet writer and journalist who died in 1999 at 49. Ms. Hunt portrays Cheryl Cohen Greene the sex therapist he hires to guide him toward his first experience of intercourse." prurience and pornographic imagery ���The Sessions�۝ is a pleasant shock: a touching profoundly sex-positive film that equates sex with intimacy tenderness and emotional connection instead of performance competition and conquest. There are moments between the client and his surrogate that are so intensely personal that your first instinct may be to avert your eyes. But the actors�۪ lighthearted rapport allows you to rejoice unashamedly in their characters�۪ pleasure." Ms. Hunt is nude. But the camera angles avoid showing genitalia. At the same time when penetration is achieved the body language and clinical dialogue clarify exactly what is happening and what is being experienced." ���Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O�۪Brien�۝ (1996) directed by Jessica Yu. This new film is largely adapted from Mr. O�۪Brien�۪s article ���On Seeing a Sex Surrogate �۝ published in 1990 in the literary magazine The Sun." he contracted polio and lost most of his mobility and muscle coordination but not his sensation below the neck. He was forced to rely on artificial respiration for all but a few hours a week. His parents instead of sending him to a nursing home cared for him and he attended the University of California Berkeley transporting himself by an electric gurney between the campus and his apartment where his iron lung was located." who was 4 feet 7 inches tall and weighed only 60 pounds (Mr. Hawkes is 5-foot-10) wrote his poems and articles by holding a stick between his teeth to tap words on a computer and to make telephone calls." Mark consults with Father Brendan (William H. Macy) a supportive open-minded priest before proceeding with therapy. ���I know in my heart that God will give you a free pass on this one ��� go for it �۝ Father Brendan reassures him." who is understandably sardonic about his faith says: ���I believe in a God with a sense of humor. I would find it absolutely intolerable not to be to able blame someone for all this.�۝" ���The Sessions�۝ becomes a different movie on a much higher plane. Cheryl has never worked with someone like Mark who must remain on his back his thin fragile body painfully contorted. This married woman is exploring uncharted territory every bit as much as Mark and the therapy is a dual journey in discovery. Inevitably she makes mistakes." she applies herself with intense dedication asking how this or that feels." who has never been touched this way before experiences waves of sensation that to his humiliation cause him to ejaculate uncontrollably. Each time Mark disappoints himself Cheryl remains a reassuring encouraging coach and they make progress." wittily self-lacerating charming and erudite. You can feel how increasingly difficult it is for both partners to follow the rules once they have reached a certain level of intimacy." though well executed are little more than tasteful d̩cor around which the main drama revolves.

as one of these sweetpeas likes to say to crush you. Year after year these big brains and little bodies at Intermediate School 318 in Williamsburg win chess tournaments and their winning streak continues on screen. They are a remarkable funny inspiring at times devastating group. Through the eyes of the director Katie Dellamaggiore you come to know these children their teachers and parents as you witness their pulse-quickening matches and tears splashed on the family dining-room table. There�۪s smiling uplift here but the road is seldom easy and sometimes brutal." Justus Williams might be a chess genius; Patrick Johnston who has attention issues just wants to raise his ranking. Pobo Efekoro helps his mother with her day care business. He doesn�۪t mind pushing around a vacuum cleaner for her; she�۪s trying hard he says and well his father is dead. By the end of the movie Pobo is writing a letter to politicians about budget cuts reminding them of their ���moral responsibility�۝ and well on his way from easygoing child to bright light and civic-minded citizen." but its reach is higher because it looks at pedagogy politics and their intersection. As Pobo suggests that means it�۪s also about moral choices. Providentially for her narrative if not the school Ms. Dellamaggiore ��� who produced ���Brooklyn Castle�۝ with her husband-editor Nelson Dellamaggiore and her brother-cinematographer Brian Schulz ��� began shooting after the 2008 economic downturn. (Nothing makes for documentary drama like a budget cut that might wipe out the subject of your project.) Bluntly put to watch a child worry that his school�۪s marching band and chess program will be cut is to witness the further collapse of a dream far bigger than he is: that of quality public education as a democratic ideal." though with mood- and stage-setting scenes mixed in with talking-head interviews. At I.S. 318 ���The geeks they are the athletes �۝ beams the principal Fred Rubino a big man with a broad smile. The chess program was started in 1991 by another principal Alan Fierstein. By 2006-07 Elizabeth Spiegel a chess coach and one of the movie�۪s heroes was teaching at I.S. 318 full time. (She is ranked an expert.) Pale reedy determined with rotating long and short hairstyles that speak to the multiyear shoot Ms. Spiegel (in the movie she is Ms. Vicary; she has since married) is a paragon of public-school virtue. Another advocate is an assistant principal John Galvin who has absorbed the game�۪s lessons into his teaching philosophy." who can wear their burdens heavily with worried eyes and anxious jittering. Being gifted and going from opening move to checkmate in between homework and chores isn�۪t easy. The children in ���Brooklyn Castle�۝ go up against intense pressures: They burn and tremble to win and watching them lose is hard but they also cope with external burdens like parents and poverty demanding teachers uncertain futures and budget woes. They keep going day after week month after year urged on by teachers who expect greatness from them and who are rewarded with students whose time before a chessboard brings them trophies scholarships and cognitive skills. The school is featured in Paul Tough�۪s new book ���How Children Succeed.�۝" but it is also unabashedly and somewhat overexcitedly a feature-length mash note to its young subjects. Yet why not? It�۪s deeply satisfying watching these public school hard-knock kids win and Ms. Dellamaggiore knows it. They struggle these children and their struggling reaches its climax in tournaments that are at once dramatic and nicely cinematic as illustrated by the many wide shots of rows upon rows of boys and girls hunched over boards in cavernous hotel rooms. Will they win? You know it. Read it and weep: In April after the documentary wrapped I.S. 318 became the first middle school team to win the United States Chess Federation�۪s national high school championship." and is absurd."

The film�۪s firm warm embrace is a better fit for the already converted particularly the many women who have adopted yoga." cancer survivors mothers delinquent teenagers newly flexible Nairobians. But the film often evokes a yoga video with its statements about feeling in harmony with oneself and its stories mostly turn on the hard-to-dispute proposition that yoga is relaxing and therapeutic." �۝ with narration enunciated by the actress and yogini Annette Bening begins with an intriguing premise: yoga historically a practice dominated by men in India now occupies a mat-carrying slot on women�۪s schedules the world over.

As we hear from members and commentators this diffuse hybrid community has evolved from humble beginnings on sites for sharing weird stuff to increasing politicization and organization in taking on the likes of the neo-Nazi Internet radio host Hal Turner and Scientology. The Scientology effort prompted by that church�۪s clampdown on the 2008 promotional video featuring Tom Cruise planted the group on terra firma with worldwide protests wearing Guy Fawkes masks." after an abbreviated lineage of earlier hacker movements. The movie is too often a hit parade of events and flare-ups with bursts of cogent analysis that become less frequent. The utopian swagger of the group�۪s young adherents prevails even when they�۪re talking about relatively common organizational uses of the Internet. Yet the passion scale and international span of Anonymous are all special and their cybersabotage smackdowns can be quite cathartic. We also do see the legal dangers of hacking though more skepticism would actually bolster the film�۪s arguments." but so are many freedoms when asserted so boldly."

They strike up a conversation that leads to friendship that leads to more and Mr. Kasdan who wrote and directed takes them through their clumsy courtship with a keen tasteful eye.

With a strange metal key that�۪s apparently grafted to one of his fingers he unlocks the door and ��� like Little Nemo tumbling into Slumberland Dorothy crossing over the rainbow and Alice falling down the rabbit hole ��� leaves one world for another." horror rapture and eddies and swells of despair. It�۪s an episodic work of great visual invention ��� from scene to scene you never see what�۪s coming ��� that reminds you just how drearily conventional many movies are. You want three acts? How dull. A pretty protagonist? Oh please. The triumph of the human spirit? Go away. Mr. Carax has nothing for you. What he has are weird tales; beautifully whirling gyrating bodies; an anguished song a sense of drift and the steady (heart) beat of lament. And still you ain�۪t seen nothin�۪ yet: at one point a diabolical creature crawls out of a Paris sewer bites off a woman�۪s fingers and then licks Eva Mendes�۪s bare underarm painting her creamy skin red with his tongue." as a fashion model kidnapped from a shoot scarcely seems to notice. She comes across as an almost indifferent damsel in distress even after a sly wardrobe change and she�۪s one of several characters or types who circulate throughout sometimes briefly. The most important of these is a chameleon of a thousand faces played and sometimes just pantomimed by Denis Lavant. An extraordinary physical specimen with a lumpy pockmarked mug suggestive of volcanic stone and a body that�۪s jumpy with sinew and muscle Mr. Lavant has appeared in most of Mr. Carax�۪s movies including as an acrobatic fire eater in the 1991 gorgeous swoon of a film ���Les Amants du Pont-Neuf.�۝ Here Mr. Lavant plays male and female old and young the living the dying and the dead." walking away from a large Streamline Moderne house a swirl of curves and portholes that sits on a hill like a luxury liner. The joyful sounds of giggling children ring out: ���See you tonight Dad! Work hard!�۝ (Earlier the caws of complaining sea gulls fill the air.) It�۪s charming and sweet or would be if not for the armed guards. The house it appears sits on a compound with multiple cars and guards and a waiting chauffeur C̩line (��dith Scob) a sober beauty who opens the door of a white limousine for the man she calls Monsieur Oscar. (Mr. Carax's original name was Alex Christophe Dupont; Leos Carax is an anagram for Alex Oscar.)" you discover a man of movement motion and moving (as in pictures). After chattering into a phone like a regular master of the universe Mr. Oscar begins busily transforming himself in the back of his now improbably spacious limo crammed with boxes bric-a-brac and a dressing room mirror. When he emerges a few beats later for the first of his multiple magical metamorphoses he looks like a shriveled old woman and almost unrecognizable. Bent over he wobbles along the bank of the Seine tapping a cane and muttering as if to himself instead of the bodyguards trailing him. He ends up shaking a beggar�۪s tin on a bridge ignored by the passers-by who surge around him like a pitiless current." nobody loves me nowhere�۝ the old woman murmurs. ���But I�۪m alive anyway.�۝" and Mr. Oscar is on the move again scanning another dossier for what he and C̩line cryptically refer to as appointments. The nature of these appointments and his role(s) in them are an abiding beguiling mystery. Mr. Carax never explains his intentions ��� and why Mr. Oscar appears like a demon in one scene and a mustachioed baldie with a knife in the next ��� leaving you to piece together meaning or meanings. All movies demand interpretation but Mr. Carax doesn�۪t seem interested in your solving his puzzle which allows you to solve it as you like. About all that�۪s clear is that Mr. Oscar works for an entity perhaps God which also makes this a movie about filmmaking and the ecstasy of creation." a god of French cinema as a kind of reproving manager.)" and exhilarating. In ���Holy Motors�۝ you never know where Mr. Carax will take you and you never know what exactly you�۪re to do once you�۪re there. Sometimes you may be amazed or delighted; other times you may feel restless or uninterested. No matter: there�۪s always another new vision coming up. If that sounds confusing it isn�۪t. Although the movie doesn�۪t have an obvious narrative through line its episodes are nonetheless deeply connected by mood visual style and Mr. Lavant. They are connected in other words by Mr. Carax�۪s singular fluid artistic vision. And while at times it feels as if ���Holy Motors�۝ had been cobbled together from a million movies it mostly wonderfully feels unlike anything else: it�۪s cinema reloaded."

Like the first it opens in 2016 with the world gripped in an economic crisis (and rife with amusingly torpid Occupy-style protests) that has led to an astonishing development that sounds like an environmentalist�۪s dream: because gas costs more than $40 a gallon Americans now rely on railroads as their major means of transportation." nor is it taken up in ���Part II.�۝ No matter business is brisk enough to keep the railroad tycoon Dagny Taggart (a wan Samantha Mathis replacing the first movie�۪s Taylor Schilling) on the go driving and walking and sometimes riding a train as she worryingly keeps tabs on her company Taggart Transcontinental and on her weak sister of a brother James (Patrick Fabian).

If you want to know what a real movie looks like rent King Vidor�۪s riotously overheated 1949 version of Rand�۪s ���Fountainhead.�۝" like ���Part I �۝ it was made for true believers. Written by Duke Sandefur Brian Patrick O�۪Toole and Duncan Scott it jumps from one location to another ��� transportation is a subject as well as a visual and narrative motif ��� without smoothing the edges creating coherent transitions or as bad trimming the long draggy passages of people moving staring into space or sitting around and talking at one another (and you) about the evils of federal regulation and the glories of capitalism." including from Teller (of Penn & Teller) Sean Hannity and Grover Norquist who is thanked in the credits not far from the logo for IATSE which represents stagehands and other entertainment workers affirming that this anti-union movie was a union production."

Mr. Duris 38 has been a major French star since ���The Beat That My Heart Skipped �۝ Jacques Audiard�۪s 2005 French adaptation of James Toback�۪s ���Fingers.�۝ In ���The Big Picture�۝ he is as compelling if not more so." Paul�۪s apparently charmed life with his wife Sarah (Marina Fo��s) and their two young boys seems about to become even cushier with the announcement by his business partner and mentor Anne (Catherine Deneuve) that she is dying and plans to turn their law practice over to him.

For lack of anything else to do he buys a secondhand camera constructs a darkroom and begins taking pictures. His buried talent blooms and a gallery pursues him. But as international recognition looms his ruse is almost certain to be exposed." �۝ ���The Big Picture �۝ directed by Eric Lartigau doesn�۪t bear down heavily on its themes of exchanged identities and second chances. Paul is not a sociopath like Tom Ripley and the movie does not convey the same diabolical Hitchcockian sense of being manipulated by a slightly sadistic master puppeteer. As the story sprawls across the screen it darts from one incident to the next as though it were inventing itself as it goes along." and at one point starts a confessional letter to Sarah." but ���The Big Picture�۝ explores the other side of the coin ��� the claustrophobic notion that it is increasingly difficult for a person to disappear.

How good they are depends on the degree of truthfulness they convey about a subject that was once shrouded in secrecy and shame but is now a reality-television staple. Alcohol addiction may not seem to be the big deal that it once was except that it often remains a matter of life and death." �۝ a small precisely observed portrait of Kate Hannah (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a Los Angeles elementary schoolteacher whose drinking spins out of control is an unsentimental movie for the age of shows like ���Intervention�۝ and ���Rehab With Dr. Drew.�۝ Its story is quite similar to ���Days of Wine and Roses �۝ minus the old-time Hollywood melodrama.

But a scene in which she and Charlie visit her bitter estranged mother (Mary Kay Place) whose first gesture is to fix them bloody marys suggests a family history of alcoholism. The mother and the strict school principal (Megan Mullally) who shows little sympathy for Kate even after she is sober are the least likable characters.

really look at her characters. Mostly Ms. DuVernay who won the directing award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival wants you to look at Ruby a lonely young nurse (Emayatzy Corinealdi) whose husband Derek (Omari Hardwick) is serving time. At once tethered to the world and seemingly detached from its thrum Ruby dedicates herself to Derek whom she regularly visits by riding a bus to the prison with all the other dutifully waiting women." slow-boiling quietly soul-stirring drama about a woman coming into her own ���Middle of Nowhere�۝ carries the imprimatur of Sundance but without the dreary stereotypes or self-satisfied politics that can (at times unfairly) characterize its offerings. The journey is hard in Ms. DuVernay���s movie as well as politically freighted but also more complex than it might initially seem. Like the title character in Victor Nu̱ez�۪s ���Ruby in Paradise �۝ an understated American independent classic with Ashley Judd that surely inspired this movie Ms. DuVernay�۪s Ruby lives in a recognizable world of familiar pleasures disappointing setbacks and everyday struggles. Ruby also lives in Compton a city directly southeast of Los Angeles and probably best known to most Americans as the backdrop for gangsta entertainments." �۝ by contrast is an ordinary nondescript place with the usual sad swaying palm trees and working people nodding to one another while they wait for a bus. The sun shines but this isn�۪t the Southern California of endless warmth and limitless possibility as suggested by the worry that flickers across Ruby�۪s face and seems to have permanently hardened her mother Ruth (a potent mesmerizing Lorraine Toussaint) turning her features into a Kabuki-like grimace frozen in fury. It�۪s an unsettling image of maternal rage ��� Ruth enters the movie in a housecoat perhaps in a sly nod to ���Precious�۝ ��� one that Ms. DuVernay as she does throughout plays with before peeling away the clich̩s and revealing the person underneath." a circumspect retiring character whose story surfaces in realistic conversations and in phone calls and visits to the prison. Seemingly friendless she lives alone in a small dimly lighted somewhat emptied out apartment that feels almost abandoned. In a sense that�۪s precisely what it has become. Ruby having single-mindedly dedicated herself to her husband for years ��� she has a thick file of documents that testifies to the time she�۪s served for him ��� has essentially abandoned her home and herself. About the only other person in her life aside from Derek and Ruth is her sister Rosie (Edwina Findley) a single mother with a young son. As you watch Ruby with her nephew it�۪s clear that she hasn�۪t entirely let go of her life but instead put it on long-term pause." Bradford Young who brings soft beauty to every image Ms. DuVernay uses long shots a shallow depth of field and punctuating close-ups of Ruby to put her existential and physical isolation into visual terms. There�۪s a haunted stillness to the character which the camera even hand-held persuasively expresses. Time and again you see Ruby looking out at the world through windows while riding to work and the prison and every so often you also see what she sees like a bus driver Brian (a terrific David Oyelowo). Brian notices Ruby and in doing so surprises her. She�۪s forgotten all about herself even as Ms. DuVernay from start to finish in this very fine movie works to make sure that Ruby is a woman to remember." and probably used at least a few times."

�۝ a smart jittery thriller about a freakish and little-known chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis a Hollywood producer says that history starts as farce and ends up as tragedy. He seems as someone rightly points out to have it backward. But as a professional dissembler he knows better. Because much like the revolutionary shock troops who seized the United States embassy on Nov. 4 1979 and turned the crisis into gripping political theater watched by the entire world ��� tune in tomorrow when America goes on trial with the special guest star the Ayatollah Khomeini ��� the producer knows that historical events alone don�۪t cut it. You need lights camera action." a Central Intelligence Agency officer was after when he was tapped to help free six State Department employees stranded in Tehran. While revolutionary forces were overrunning the embassy and taking hostages including the 52 men and women who were held for 444 days five Americans fled undetected. Eventually they made their way to safety including at the Canadian ambassador�۪s house staying hidden (with a sixth escapee) while the C.I.A. the State Department and the president struggled to find a way to ferry them home. Mr. Mendez a wizard of disguise came up with the cover story for the six escapees that improbably stuck: They would pose as a Canadian movie crew." however who directed ���Argo�۝ from a script by Chris Terrio and cast himself in the pivotal role of Tony Mendez realized that comedy alone wouldn�۪t do. American lives after all were at stake (a situation that contemporary viewers will be all too familiar with) and so after opening the movie with a bit of history and archival imagery he rushes into the moment�۪s jarring unsettling craziness with a cinematic whoosh. Fast and faster he sets the skittish stage with convincing you-are-there re-creations and then jumps back and forth between the chanting exultant Iranian protesters outside the embassy and the freaked-out Americans inside it." working from Mr. Mendez�۪s book ���The Master of Disguise �۝ and a 2007 Wired magazine article ���The Great Escape �۝ by the journalist Joshuah Bearman embellishes the official story without eviscerating it. Given how great the very premise is it makes sense to stick more or less to the official record ��� a series of photographs from the hostage crisis that is juxtaposed with stills from the movie show how close Mr. Affleck hews to the evidence ��� and he and his production team clearly had fun with the Chia Pet facial hair oversize glasses wide collars fat ties and earth-toned threads. Shrewdly he visually transmits the escalating claustrophobia of the escapees�۪ confinement with billowing cigarette smoke small rooms a limited palette and shallow depth of field." after setting your pulse racing he smoothly downshifts easing from the high anxiety of the opener ��� which evokes 1970s political thrillers like Sydney Pollack�۪s ���Three Days of the Condor�۝ ��� into something looser mellower and funny. After Mendez spitballs escape plans with his bosses (including an amusing Bryan Cranston popping neck tendons) he receives the green light to go Hollywood. To make the movie idea work he flies to Los Angeles where he brings in an old colleague John Chambers (John Goodman breezy and reined in) a real makeup artist who received an honorary Oscar for ���Planet of the Apes.�۝ Next on board is a dyspeptically seasoned producer Lester Siegel (a wonderful Alan Arkin) who helps make the fake project now a science-fiction flick called ���Argo �۝ look legit." serving as comic relief that Mr. Affleck uses contrapuntally with the increasingly tense perilous situation in Tehran. The scenes of Mendez swanning through Los Angeles across a rooftop party at the Beverly Hilton and a studio lot where Chambers and Siegel set up shop are enjoyably preposterous. Then again as the Hollywood veterans knowingly observe there is a certain kinship between the spectacle they�۪re putting on and the really big show the Iranian revolutionaries have staged. Budget aside it comes down to selling the story and the roles persuasively which the escapees ��� nicely played by Clea DuVall Tate Donovan Scoot McNairy Rory Cochrane Christopher Denham and Kerry Bish̩ ��� soon learn." on camera and behind it with a noticeable lack of self-aggrandizement. He doesn�۪t show off with his direction or the performances going for detail instead of bombast with eerie silences traded glances trembling gestures and beaded sweat. (It�۪s a good guess that he�۪s committed the unnerving opening of ���Three Days of the Condor�۝ to memory.) His own delivery can be so tamped down that he sometimes registers as overly restrained almost bland yet his control serves the material partly because it would have been a mistake for him to try to upstage this story much less Mr. Goodman and Mr. Arkin. And then in the end this is a story about outwitting rather than killing the enemy making it a homage to actual intelligence and an example of the same."

The kicker is that the woman Jenn (Jenn Harris) wants to do it the old-fashioned way. The man Matt (Matthew Wilkas) is easily persuaded. But after setting up that proviso and providing the requisite awkward (and unconvincing) sex scene the movie drops the idea and moves on to oddly chaste masturbating-into-a-cup scenes." and you can feel the padding: he gives Matt and Jenn his-and-her quirky workplaces his-and-her quip-ready gay pals (one played by Mr. Lisecki) and his-and-her date nights with handsome men. And to pump up the narrative after the baby-making-through-intercourse plot loses steam Mr. Lisecki comes up with a brawl that keeps Jenn and Matt apart." ���Gayby�۝ is too diffuse to have much pop when it comes to the topics at hand: love and friendship and how unconventional modern permutations might help rewrite the script of romance."

the activist documentary ���The House I Live In�۝ is persuasively urgent. Directed with heart by Eugene Jarecki the movie is an insistently personal and political look at the war on drugs and its thousands of casualties including those serving hard time for minor offenses. It is Mr. Jarecki asserts ��� as he sifts through the data weighs the evidence and checks in with those on both sides of the law ��� a war that has led to mass incarcerations characterized by profound racial disparities and that has created another front in the civil rights movement." for starters the name of a song written by Lewis Allan and the blacklisted Earl Robinson (���All races and religions/That�۪s America to me�۝) that became a part of the Paul Robeson songbook. Frank Sinatra sang it in a 1945 short film of the same title that is a plea for tolerance written by Albert Maltz one of the Hollywood 10. Mr. Jarecki uses the Robeson version over the final credits of the documentary a nod to that singer�۪s long history of civil rights activism. Touchingly the song also serves as Mr. Jarecki�۪s plaintive acknowledgment that his documentary was directly inspired by his lifelong relationship with an African-American woman who worked for his family Nannie Jeter (her real name)." Mr. Jarecki says early ���like a second mother�۝ to him when he was growing up. On its face and unexamined that statement could be a perilous risible gambit but Mr. Jarecki navigates skillfully through the complexities of his relationship with Ms. Jeter partly by immediately addressing his own privilege. She entered his life shortly after he was born and their worlds overlapped as the decades passed." and her children and grandchildren were my playmates growing up �۝ Mr. Jarecki says his voice wafting over images of Ms. Jeter and her family closely watching television coverage of the 2008 presidential election. ���But as we got older �۝ Mr. Jarecki continues ���I saw many of them struggling with poverty joblessness crime and worse.�۝" �۝ her answer ��� drugs ��� surprised him. Whether Mr. Jarecki was as surprised as he states is immaterial to how he uses this relationship between a white man and his long-term black caretaker to build an argument about drugs in America and more critically about race and class. Nothing in the movie including the data he amasses the history he excavates and the miles he racks up during his investigation is as striking as his decision to risk seeming na��ve or worse by making himself part of the story. Yet it is precisely his insistence that this is the house that he too lives in that helps distinguish this movie investing it with resonant feeling." but it�۪s one he has seized on with characteristic vigor. As he showed in earlier documentaries like ���The Trials of Henry Kissinger�۝ and ���Why We Fight�۝ (about the military-industrial complex) Mr. Jarecki is fearless about taking on sprawling subjects that could eat up 10 hours on cable and squeezing them into feature-length packages. The war on drugs which officially stretches back to the Nixon administration is the kind of large-scale topic that Mr. Jarecki loves digging into and he does so here effectively showing and telling with a wealth of rapidly shuffled visual material including judiciously deployed family photographs and home movies newsreels television news reports and the archival like." Mr. Jarecki smoothly folds these images in with dizzying statistics and a cavalcade of talking-head interviews with a range of sympathetic experts including Michelle Alexander the author of ���The New Jim Crow.�۝ He also checks in with a psychologist as well as with historians legal professionals prisoner advocates and inmates. Among the most important collaborators he taps for explanatory duties is the journalist turned pop-culture god David Simon the creator of ���The Wire.�۝ Receiving what seems to be more screen time than any interviewee Mr. Simon makes at once a fine friendly narrative guide; a restrained voice of moral outrage; and as the movie builds to its sweeping conclusions a conspicuous stand-in for Mr. Jarecki." �۝ which tackles too much in too brief a time and glosses over complexities yet this is also a model of the ambitious vitalizing activist work that exists to stir the sleeping to wake."

A young infantryman injured in Afghanistan battles to exchange a daunting prescription-pill regimen for alternative therapies to alleviate his post-traumatic stress disorder and nerve damage." the film argues we can switch from an unsustainable ���disease management system�۝ that relies on expensive drugs and often unnecessary medical procedures to one that focuses on prevention over cure. This is a drum that the doctors Andrew Weil and Dean Ornish have been beating for years and ���Escape Fire�۝ cleverly weaves their concerns over poor lifestyle choices into a broader story of corporate lobbying and profit-driven care.

great works of literature arrive on screen weighed down by their reputations immobilized in a straitjacket of cultural prestige. Emily Bront�ǉ۪s ���Wuthering Heights�۝ is a wild emanation of Victorian genius half-tamed by time and term papers and Andrea Arnold�۪s new film adaptation is an admirable frustrating attempt to strip away the novel�۪s inherited ���classic�۝ status and restore its raw and earthy passion." with Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier as Cathy and Heathcliff) Ms. Arnold�۪s ���Wuthering Heights �۝ with the screen�۪s first black Heathcliff (played by two different actors) emphasizes mud misery and savage inarticulate feelings. Shot in a boxy format with a drab harsh palette that suits the weather and the mood of emotional and material deprivation the movie intersperses vertiginous Yorkshire vistas with almost microscopic examinations of the local flora and fauna. There are close-ups of moths beetles lichen and weeds provided as background for a Darwinian study of lust and domination." puppies tormented and livestock roughly treated. Horses are granted at least a measure of dignity perhaps more than the human residents of this elemental world. We first encounter a mature Heathcliff (James Howson) doing violence to himself beating his head against a wall in a fit of rage and despair and we quickly perceive that his earlier life was no less brutal." one of several storms that punctuate the narrative and amplify its tempestuous moods." Cathy (Shannon Beer) welcomes him by spitting in his face and he greets his new family with growls and curses. Mr. Earnshaw the patriarch (Paul Hilton) is stern but compassionate though his severe discipline is better than the vengeful sadism of his son Hindley (Lee Shaw) who takes over the household after the old man dies." who wrote the screenplay with Olivia Hetreed depicts their sometimes rough intimacy as a primordial state of hunger deeper than language reason or even sexual desire. She has a particular knack for bringing alive the inchoate angry urges of adolescence and for turning the sullen faces and slack postures of young untrained actors into frighteningly expressive instruments." set in a modern northern England of housing projects and shabby town centers is likely to have been haunted (and persuaded) by its portrait of teenage fury and social dysfunction. ���Wuthering Heights�۝ extends that vision backward." first published pseudonymously in 1847 takes place mostly at the end of the previous century. Ms. Arnold imagines the past not as a simpler more innocent time but as an era blighted by older versions of the same cruelties ��� rooted in differences of sex race and social position ��� that afflict our own." a stout windswept lass grows up into a willowy lady (played by Kaya Scodelario) with finer clothes and a house far grander and cleaner than the Earnshaw property that gives the film its name. (She also has a pathetic husband Edgar played in boyhood by Jonathan Powell and as a man by James Northcote.)" Heathcliff having made a mysterious fortune trades the rags of his wretched youth for a velvet coat and breeches. But the film like the hearts of its protagonists continues to dwell in a state of unruly unbuttoned intensity." off-kilter angles and hurtling hand-held camerawork; the guttural stammerings of the actors; and the ambient muck of the production design are signs of what has become a familiar aesthetic agenda. These techniques are meant to create a sense of immediacy a supremely powerful naturalism." curiously enough the effect is the opposite. The grunts and howls seem every bit as mannered as the florid diction of Olivier and Oberon perhaps even more so. Their artifice like Bront�ǉ۪s own was overt whereas Ms. Arnold strives to disguise hers in the trappings of authenticity. And as a result the impact ��� the grandeur the art ��� of ���Wuthering Heights�۝ is diminished."

Yes child trafficking is horrific; but embedding your raise-the-alarm mission in a film this inept runs the risk of arousing more amusement than activism." Cambodia the story (by Christopher Bessette who also directs) follows a sting operation run by Alex a clench-jawed investigator (Dermot Mulroney). While Alex stalks an oily pimp and a shifty-eyed American pervert his wife (Mira Sorvino wan and weepy) volunteers at a shelter for rescued girls. Neither has come to terms with the loss of a daughter who died years earlier a tidbit that coupled with Alex�۪s unprofessional behavior suggests damaged adults may not be the best saviors of endangered children." ���Trade of Innocents�۝ is an agenda-driven drama (Ms. Sorvino serves as a United Nations good-will ambassador for combating human trafficking) that spells everything out in flowery moralistic speeches.

Ms. Gray�۪s performance by far the least showy does not exactly ground the film but at least introduces a hint of emotional gravity.

A particular scene in which Jack is stung by jellyfish and his pal Charlotte Bless (Ms. Kidman) offers treatment has already achieved some notoriety though it�۪s hardly the strangest or most shocking moment." garishly made up and harshly lighted is a vampy campy whirlwind: a femme fatale a good-time girl and a tragic diva with a husky drawl and teased hair. Charlotte who has a special affection for prisoners has promised herself to Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) an uncouth alligator hunter convicted of killing a hated local lawman. During one jailhouse visit Charlotte and Hillary pantomime oral sex across a crowded room an encounter that manages to be grotesque absurd and also kind of hot." since coherent storytelling is even lower on the list of Mr. Daniels�۪s priorities than protecting Mr. Efron�۪s modesty. Jack�۪s brother Ward (Mr. McConaughey) a crusading journalist shows up with a colleague Yardley Acheman (David Oyelowo) to investigate the apparent miscarriage of justice that sent the cretinous Hillary to the slammer." tinged with racial animosity and macho rivalry is one of many interesting and volatile undercurrents in this tangled and chaotic movie. Mr. Daniels is much more interested in sensation than in conventional suspense so the murder mystery is pushed into the background." serviceable whodunit on basic cable or the paperback rack at an airport bookstore.

This turns out to be a gambit for the homeless Marcus to crash and get grub but the sweaty terrible drum practice and clubgoing energize Troy." this flatly directed film depends on its young leads. Mr. Wysocki underplaying at times to a fault conveys the genuine boredom of miserable resignation and the gradual returns on stepping out of his shell. His life also isn�۪t represented as a series of humiliations in the common fashion; we see more of his daydream fantasies shown without preamble." and Mr. O�۪Leary�۪s charm makes this funny plausible and pathologically accurate. Yet Marcus�۪s struggles which affect Troy�۪s home life with his strict ex-Marine father (Billy Campbell) push Mr. Wysocki already underplaying out of our focus.

it is that pious expressions of concern for ���the children�۝ are usually evidence of a political agenda in overdrive. ���Won�۪t Back Down �۝ a new schoolhouse melodrama starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis presents an especially blatant example of this rule. A movie that insists repeatedly and at high volume that ���it�۪s all about the kids�۝ might just cause you to wonder what else it is about and this one is not shy about showing its ideological hand." after all could possibly be against kids? The film�۪s answer is one favored by some partisans in the raucous and confusing public debate about educational reform: teachers�۪ unions. Opening a little more than a week after the end of a strike by Chicago teachers ���Won�۪t Back Down �۝ which makes the vague claim to have been ���inspired by true events �۝ pits a plucky passionate band of parents and educators against a venal and intransigent cabal of labor bosses and their greedy complacent rank-and-file minions." as I write this in the care of the largest public school system in the country I am not inclined to cheerlead for a status quo that all too often cloaks its promotion of mediocrity in the language of excellence. And the first scenes of ���Won�۪t Back Down�۝ (directed by Daniel Barnz from a script he wrote with Brin Hill) paint a convincing and familiar picture of institutional failure." a second-grader with dyslexia is stuck in a classroom at Adams Elementary in Pittsburgh presided over by a lazy tenured lump of pedagogical indifference. Across the hall is Nona Alberts (Ms. Davis) a once-proud teacher whose idealism and dedication have withered after years of frustration. Nona�۪s son Cody (Dante Brown) attends a different school where he struggles with his homework and his trouble seems to be both a cause and a consequence of his parents�۪ unraveling marriage. (Nona�۪s husband is played by Lance Reddick)." Jamie (Ms. Gyllenhaal) at a charter-school lottery and the two women become allies in a fight to save Adams by taking it over. A state law allows parents and teachers to assume control of a failing school if they navigate a cumbersome bureaucratic procedure gathering petition signatures and putting together a detailed proposal. Nona and Jamie set about doing this but the movie is less concerned with the details of the project than with the heady emotions of their crusade. And also with identifying the villains who stand in their way in particular the cynical self-serving union leaders played by Holly Hunter and Ned Eisenberg." the filmmakers make a perfunctory show of fairness to both sides of the argument. Some of Nona�۪s colleagues are sympathetic to her cause but reluctant to give away their collective bargaining rights. Another teacher Michael Perry (Oscar Isaac) ��� a ukulele-playing Teach for America-trained hottie who has a romance with Jamie ��� insists on defending the union even at the risk of alienating his new girlfriend. Ms. Hunter�۪s character has a misty moment recalling her parents�۪ heroism organizing workers in Southern textile mills." and its third act is a mighty cataract of speechifying and breathless plot turns that strip the narrative down to its Manichaean core. Once teachers give up job security and guaranteed benefits learning disabilities will be cured pencils will stop breaking and the gray skies of Pittsburgh will glow with sunshine. Who could be against that?" and it is a question that might well be directed at the filmmakers who have turned the rousing rhetoric and simple us-against-them storytelling of the classic strike film upside down. As drama the movie is not entirely ineffective thanks mainly to the cast. Ms. Davis�۪s gravity and Ms. Gyllenhaal�۪s exuberance harmonize nicely though it may be worth noting that both of them ��� along with just about everyone else named in the credits ��� are dues-paying union members." ���Won�۪t Back Down�۝ might serve as a useful counterweight to the conventional wisdom that Hollywood is a liberal propaganda factory. But however you take its politics the film upholds a dreary tradition of simplifying and sentimentalizing matters of serious social concern and dumbing down issues that call for clarity and creative thinking.

The makeover is a distracting miscalculation and a curious one given that for his last movie ���The Brothers Bloom �۝ Mr. Johnson cast the non look-alikes Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo in the title roles. Even so after the bodies and plot twists pile up and after you�۪ve scoped out the Bruce-ified downward curve of Mr. Gordon-Levitt�۪s nose and laughed when he worriedly touches his receding hairline the movie starts getting its groove on." including an antediluvian divide between hard-charging men and decorative dames including a stripper Suzie (Piper Perabo) who works at a club called La Belle Aurore the name of the Paris joint where Humphrey Bogart once met Ingrid Bergman.

�۝ a dreamy elliptical neo-noir about a cop turned killer turned something else altogether. This 180 shift in perspective occurs early in the movie which the Thai writer and director Pen-ek Ratanaruang adapted from a novel by his compatriot Win Lyovarin. It�۪s a contemporary if shopworn story of good and evil decency versus corruption and one man fighting the machine when topsy-turvy and not. Mr. Pen-ek has said it�۪s also a political tale if not transparently so for those unfamiliar with Thai history. For the uninitiated the kick won�۪t be the story or its meanings but rather its silky fusion of pulp fiction material and art cinema style." his face concealed is typing a letter (talk about old-timey) that ends up in the hands of Tul (Nopachai Jayanama) whose face is also obscured. There�۪s no obvious reason for this initial hide-and-seek even if the theme of identity notably involving the cop Tul was and the killer he becomes is a thread that weaves through the story. Yet as the camera prowls through the shadows to linger on a cigarette burning in an ashtray or to trace a scar edging a neck Mr. Pen-ek is at once visually goosing the setup plotting the coordinates of his tale and invoking film history." dames and dicks and eight million or more naked city stories. With perfect deadpan and in well-used wide-screen Mr. Pen-ek samples a number of familiar hard-boiled codes and conventions creating a moody intrigue with murder and betrayal questions and answers dramatic rules (the loaded gun that must go off) and symbolic figures (the enigmatic hit man a mysterious boss a beautiful siren). He plays with this formula partly through the unhurried borderline desultory pacing that�۪s more common in art-house releases than in genre fare. His use of Buddhist imagery and karma kinks up the noir too as when Tul disguised as a monk surprises a rich victim by pulling a gun out of a begging bowl answering giveback with payback." which simply forces you to think briefly about numbers. Like the few needless cruel images of slowly dying and distressed animals in the movie the scrambled time doesn�۪t deepen the meaning. The same is true of Tul�۪s affair with a prostitute Joy (Chanokporn Sayoungkul) who fulfills the role of the requisite sad beauty and something more predictably heavy." who seems to have watched ���Taxi Driver��� before shooting ���Headshot�۝ ��� some scenes play like loose riffs on that cinematic fetish object ��� deploys his moving parts with a high level of self-awareness and visual beauty which doesn�۪t make them necessarily interesting just easy on the eyes."

Vreeland a doyenne of 20th-century fashion and a paradigmatic self-made woman had a genius for the inspirational the gnomic and the divinely quotable. Atwitter before Twitter she was a fabulous wit who brings to mind Wilde and Warhol even while being inimitably Vreelandesque: ���The best thing about London is Paris.�۝ ���Fashion is not the same thing as style.�۝ ���I loathe narcissism but I approve of vanity.�۝" n̩e Diana Dalziel was born in Paris around the turn of the 20th century and died in New York in 1989. In between she lived an extraordinary life that in classic American fashion was a triumph of self-invention. Her father Frederick Young Dalziel was British and a stockbroker; her mother Emily Key Hoffman (related to Francis Scott Key) was American and cruel at least to her eldest daughter. ���Parents you know �۝ Vreeland says in ���D.V. �۝ her compulsively readable autobiography ���can be terrible.�۝ Certainly that seems true of her mother who when Vreeland was a child told her that she was ���extremely ugly �۝ unfavorably comparing her to Diana�۪s younger sister Alexandra. ���It didn�۪t offend me that much �۝ she said. She just walked out of the room and it seems onto her own path." which was written and directed by Lisa Immordino Vreeland the wife of a Vreeland grandson Alexander. (He runs the Diana Vreeland Estate which supports the Web site dianavreeland.com.) Ms. Vreeland exploits the family connection smartly sprinkling the movie with talking-head interviews with her relatives including Diana�۪s sons Frederick and Tim. Although both men are fairly discreet when it comes to their mother there�۪s no denying the pain that edges into their faces when they discuss life with her. Diana Vreeland was mad (one of her favorite words) about her beautiful husband Thomas Reed Vreeland a banker and apparent philanderer whose goatishness is elided here but she doesn�۪t appear to have been remotely interested in being a parent." Annette Miller and Jonathan Epstein that�۪s taken from transcripts of the conversations they had while working on ���D.V.�۝ As Plimpton gently prods and coaxes Vreeland parries and thrusts digresses and dissembles sometimes hilariously narrating a life that became a vocation and included a quarter-century at Harper�۪s Bazaar and an influential reign at Vogue where she was the editor from 1963 to 1971. Their conversation is the spine of the movie that also features many glittering witnesses including an animated funny Manolo Blahnik who proclaims and exclaims while next to a high-heel shoe. Ali MacGraw a former Vreeland assistant testifies in front of what looks like a statue of Buddha." sustained by a deep unquenchable hunger for life and a revolt against conformity and Mommy Meanest. Some of that life was ridiculous yet it�۪s clear that when Vreeland pushed purple mittens she wasn�۪t just doling out giddily eccentric counsel she was also issuing a call for independence individuality nonconformity. Life is absurd so just put on some chandelier earrings and rouge to greet it. There was she knew a wide wonderful world out there for the grabbing and tasting.

but I�۪m also not sure which comparison best suits this easygoing unsurprising movie directed by Robert Lorenz from a script by Randy Brown. Regrettably it is not a home run or a perfect game but it isn�۪t a wild throw an errant bunt or a dropped fly ball either. ���Trouble With the Curve�۝ is either an off-speed pitch that just catches the edge of the strike zone or a bloop single lofted into right field. The runner is safe. The movie is too. Crack open a peanut and flag down the beer guy." muttering grumpily to himself ��� though not this time in the service of a political campaign ��� plays Gus Lobel a longtime scout for the Atlanta Braves. Gus�۪s eyesight is failing and his job is threatened by a younger front-office hotshot (Matthew Lillard) whose approach to baseball involves numbers and computers and all that newfangled nonsense. If this were ���Moneyball �۝ last year�۪s autumnal baseball picture the guy would be a hero but ���Trouble With the Curve�۝ is the anti-���Moneyball.�۝ The old-time scouts from that film mocked for their superstitions about ���intangibles�۝ and ���instincts �۝ get their revenge this time around thanks to the greatest avenger of them all." of course. Comeuppance is a dish best served just before the final credits after the audience has gotten good and mad at the designated jerks.

If you have seen ���Space Cowboys�۝ or ���Gran Torino�۝ or any number of other late-period Eastwood movies you know that cantankerous wisdom will triumph over youthful smarts. You also know that Mr. Eastwood�۪s dry grouchy manner camouflages a sentimental streak and that at least one member of the younger generation will be the object of tenderness rather than contempt." for example Hilary Swank�۪s job in the great ���Million Dollar Baby.�۝ In this case Gus�۪s prot̩g̩e and foil is his daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) a shiny red-haired apple who has not fallen far from the gnarly paternal tree. At first relations between them are strained almost to the point of rupture. Mickey is a lawyer one big case away from making partner at a prestigious firm and she is exasperated by her father�۪s stubbornness and emotional distance. It will not take Sigmund Freud to deduce that father and daughter are in fact quite similar; it will take Justin Timberlake who shows up to provide a feeble romantic spark and a hint of generic sex appeal." Mickey nudged by her dad�۪s old pal Pete (John Goodman) shows up to lend a hand. She and Gus cross paths with Johnny (Mr. Timberlake) a washed-up pitcher who has been sent by the Red Sox to check out a much-hyped high school slugger. This prospect (played by Joe Massingill) is both talented and obnoxious. So is Mickey�۪s rival back at the law firm. You don�۪t have to be an expert sign stealer to know exactly what will happen and more or less when." but it hardly matters. Originality is for punks. As a filmmaker Mr. Eastwood is a master of reviving tired genres and finding truth and soul in clich̩s. Mr. Lorenz who has worked with Mr. Eastwood as a producer and assistant director for many years hews close to the master�۪s style in his directing debut. Mr. Eastwood�۪s longtime cinematographer Tom Stern shoots the mostly outdoor locations in a restrained handsome palette neither too gauzy nor too gritty." a serviceable scaffolding for a handful of expert satisfying performances. A gaggle of first-rate character actors trails Mr. Eastwood from Turner Field in Atlanta to the rural bars and ballparks and the star knows how to step aside and let them work. He also has the good sense to realize that much as we may adore him we�۪d sometimes rather spend time with Ms. Adams who somehow grows tougher funnier scarier and more charming with every role. In the larger scheme of things ���Trouble With the Curve�۝ may be an exhibition game with nothing much at stake but Ms. Adams brings the heat. She swings for the fence. Snags the line drive tags the runner and makes the throw to the plate. Find your own metaphor." mild cursing vague sexuality."

As visually kinetic as it is politically dubious it sings the song of two Los Angeles police officers Brian (a good Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike (an equally fine Michael Pe̱a) brothers in blue who roll in a black and white. Like the cops in Joseph Wambaugh�۪s 1970 novel ���The New Centurions�۝ they are soldiers amid in Mr. Wambaugh�۪s roll call ���whores flimflammers paddy hustlers hugger muggers ex-cons of all descriptions and anybody else with a kink of some kind or other.�۝" men and women with neck tattoos dead eyes and names as blunt as their violence: Demon Wicked Big Evil." identified in the movie as South Central but since 2003 officially known as South Los Angeles. The new name was an attempt to distance the area from the civil disobedience that has convulsed the city and the more localized violence that depending on your take has been immortalized or exploited in films like ���Training Day �۝ which Mr. Ayer wrote." Brian who endures a crucible of violence and experiences something of a moral education. A former Marine (Mr. Ayer was in the Navy) Brian is ambitious and taking prelaw classes for which he�۪s making an epically long video. This plot device allows Mr. Ayer to tell the story through Brian�۪s hand-held camera the mini-cameras he pins to his and Mike�۪s uniforms the surveillance camera in their squad car and images shot by other characters including the gangbangers. Mr. Ayer was clearly after a hyper-verisimilitude of the sort deployed in some contemporary horror flicks an unmediated realism that�۪s meant to suggest the truth of the image but as it does here only confirms its entertaining artifice." it just looks and plays like a mainstream multi-act movie with a lot of super-shaky run-and-gun imagery. After a while Mr. Ayer�۪s visual gimmickry calms down or simply ceases to distract as the episodic story takes Brian and Mike from the city�۪s mean streets to their homes and women Janet (Anna Kendrick sexily cast against type) and Gabby (Natalie Martinez). The women are unsurprisingly secondary figures although each puts in quality domestic time with the guys." and their rabidly violent gangbanging counterpart (Yahira Garcia). Mostly though this is about men loving each other and fighting the evil that other men do." and almost all of it is committed by the black and mainly brown people on the other side of the blue line. Mr. Pe̱a�۪s sympathetic performance and likable character help keep the movie from coming across as a kind of freakout over the specter of a Latino Nation." notably in the use of a Public Enemy song and a scene in which a middle-aged African-American tough (a vivid Cle Sloan) favorably compares the cops to original gangsters.

Vibeke Lokkeberg�۪s ���Tears of Gaza�۝ is less a documentary than a collage of suffering. Dropping us smack in the middle of the Israeli attacks on Gaza in the winter of 2008-9 the film tramples politics beneath the raw weight of civilian testimony. Woven together these monologues of bereavement and confusion illustrated with images so terrible they repel rational explanation form a tapestry of human misery that�۪s impossible to shake off." Ms. Lokkeberg (a Norwegian who was refused access to Gaza) spotlights the extreme deprivation of life under a blockade and the physical and psychological wounds of war. A sickeningly beautiful rain of nighttime missiles is followed by wrenching shots of suffocated infants being hauled from pulverized homes. Tiny broken bodies ��� some seemingly fired on at point-blank range ��� blanket the film often in excruciating close-up. Postcarnage interviews allow the stunned reactions of three surviving children to shape a quiet meditation on lives irretrievably altered." ���Tears of Gaza�۝ forces us to ask a single electric question: Amid this much horror does context even matter?"

1967 hundreds ��� maybe thousands ��� of people congregated in the international terminal of Kennedy Airport not to embark on flights to far-flung places but rather well it isn�۪t entirely clear or relevant. The gathering was an impromptu party a nonpolitical demonstration a happening named in the spirit of the times a fly-in. Now we might be inclined to see it as a prehistoric flash mob an example of the power of communication technology to create instantaneous ephemeral but nonetheless meaningful communities." and the brains behind the fly-in ��� though he modestly described himself as a humble ���neuron�۝ ��� was Bob Fass a late-night host on WBAI-FM (99.5) in New York. Mr. Fass whose sonorous baritone still can be heard on the station offering provocation and comfort to insomniacs and late-shift workers is the subject of ���Radio Unnameable �۝ a new documentary by Paul Lovelace and Jessica Wolfson. Drawing on archival photographs and audiotape the filmmakers pay tribute both to an influential voice in broadcasting and to the times whose ideals and follies he helped articulate." you weren�۪t there. That may be so but Mr. Lovelace and Ms. Wolfson assemble a motley graying assortment of characters who seem to have forgotten nothing. Mr. Fass narrates old war (and antiwar) stories with vivid clarity and impeccable timing and his accounts are fleshed out by a Greek chorus of friends co-workers and fellow travelers. These include the singers Judy Collins and Arlo Guthrie; Mr. Fass�۪s current and former wives; WBAI staff members: and pillars of countercultural mischief like Wavy Gravy Ed Sanders and Paul Krassner. The case they make for Mr. Fass�۪s importance does not seem overstated. WBAI�۪s eccentric millionaire owner Louis Schweitzer donated it in 1959 to the Pacifica Foundation a nonprofit operator of listener-supported stations so that it would not broadcast commercials. It was (and remains) an oasis of nonconformity in a slick and standardized medium. Mr. Fass working after midnight was a pioneer in free-form radio using his airtime to improvise a collage of music ideas and meandering conversation. The fly-in was an experiment meant to test not only his persuasive powers but also more vitally his intuition that his isolated listeners might constitute an invisible tribe." if you prefer. Or even a movement. The giddy hedonism of the airport caper mutated into something more serious. When a woman in Greenwich Village told Mr. Fass on the air of having been displaced by a fire listeners called in with offers of shelter and assistance. During a sanitation strike Mr. Fass mobilized his audience into volunteer cleanup crews. And as opposition to the Vietnam War heated up his broadcast became a hub of organizing as well as a source of firsthand news reporting. The Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman called in with news of the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial that followed the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention." adding new details and dimensions to a well-known myth-smeared story. But the film also tells a more complicated less heady story of post-�۪60s sectarianism and drift. One ambition of the supposedly revolutionary New Left often seemed to be little more than putting a different younger group of white men in charge of things. But the social movements that followed ��� feminism gay liberation post-civil rights multiculturalism ��� challenged this view. At WBAI in the �۪70s things got very messy. There was a coup a strike and an occupation and Mr. Fass was taken from the studio in handcuffs." of course and is still fighting. He and his old friends try to nudge the movie toward present-day relevance and it is certainly possible to see premonitions of Occupy Wall Street in some of the Yippie actions of yesteryear." finally elegiac. It can make you wish ��� or if you�۪re lucky remember ��� that you were a sleepless New Yorker in 1967 kept from loneliness by a gentle soulful voice on the radio."

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/movies/review-the-master-from-paul-thomas-anderson.html
�۝ Paul Thomas Anderson�۪s imposing confounding and altogether amazing new film is partly concerned with the life and work of one Lancaster Dodd leader of a therapeutic quasi-religious cult known as the Cause. Dodd�۪s ���process �۝ a stew of Freud hypnosis and carnival sideshow mumbo-jumbo is based on a kind of mental time travel. The subject is led by a series of pointed painful questions on a search for past trauma ��� earlier in life before birth in a previous existence ��� that can be identified as the source of negative emotion and destructive behavior in the present." suggesting that instead of ���remembering�۝ our prenatal past our minds ���imagine�۝ it. This shift leads to some consternation among his followers (notably a wealthy benefactor played by Laura Dern) and it may also fuel the audience�۪s skepticism about this charismatic mountebank brought to life by Philip Seymour Hoffman with the flair and precision of a great concert pianist." dinner-table toasts and bawdy songs ��� Dodd is so adept at the performance of sincerity that he may long ago have fooled himself into believing the bizarre doctrines he seems to pull out of thin air. ���The Master �۝ meanwhile is rigorously agnostic about his methods and intentions refusing the temptations of satire and gazing fondly at Dodd�۪s follies even as it notes the brutal way he and his acolytes deal with doubters and heretics. This semi-sympathetic stance makes sense since the film a glorious and haunting symphony of color emotion and sound is very much its own Cause." substituting invention for memory. Movies turn this lapse into a principle manufacturing collective fantasies that are often more vivid more real than what actually happened. ���The Master �۝ unfolding in the anxious movie-saturated years just after World War II is not a work of history in the literal or even the conventionally literary sense. The strange and complicated story it has to tell exists beyond the reach of doubt or verification. The cumulative artifice on display is beautiful ��� camera movements that elicit an involuntary gasp passages in Jonny Greenwood�۪s score that raise the hair on the back of your neck feats of acting that defy comprehension ��� but all of it has been marshaled in the pursuit of a new kind of cinematic truth. This is a movie that defies understanding even as it compels reverent astonished belief." the founder of Scientology and there are strong echoes of Hubbard�۪s Dianetics in the theory and practice of the Cause but viewers of ���The Master�۝ hoping for insight into the prehistory of Tom Cruise�۪s love life will be disappointed. Hubbard�۪s rise is the kernel of this film much in the way that the career of the early-20th-century California oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny was the seed from which Mr. Anderson (assisted by Upton Sinclair�۪s muckraking novel ���Oil!�۝) coaxed the lurid blossom that was ���There Will Be Blood.�۝ The stiff theatrical pseudo-realism of period drama is the last thing on this director�۪s mind." richly detailed and absolutely plausible vision of 1950 and the cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. takes advantage of the density and sheen of the 70-millimeter format to approximate the lush visual grandeur of mid-50s melodrama. The specters of Eisenhower-era auteurs like George Stevens Max Ophuls Nicholas Ray and Douglas Sirk hover just outside the frame along with the ghosts of the spiritual seekers sexual adventurers and shellshocked veterans who dotted the American landscape at the dawn of the atomic age." an alcoholic wreck played with sly manic ferocity by Joaquin Phoenix. ���The Master�۝ is really more Freddie�۪s story than Dodd�۪s and some of the film�۪s drama resides in the struggle between the two characters ��� and perhaps the two actors ��� for supremacy. ���You�۪ll be my prot̩g̩ and my guinea pig �۝ Dodd says to Freddie shortly after their first meeting. There turns out to be a lot more to it than that. They are father and son guru and disciple passionate friends and bitter competitors locked in a relationship whose sexual undercurrents are as palpable and mysterious as the motion of water under the surface of the ocean." Freddie a native of Lynn Mass. washes up in California like a bit of human flotsam. Psychiatric interviews before his discharge confirm what a few wartime scenes have already suggested namely that this guy is a mess. Shown a series of Rorschach inkblots he sees only genitalia. Asked to account for his strange behavior he mumbles and equivocates. Though Freddie finds work at a department store and later in the cabbage fields of Salinas his real vocation is inventing and consuming cocktails made of paint thinner darkroom chemicals household cleaning supplies and whatever else is at hand." but the film does not supply a diagnosis. Freddie�۪s menacing oddness may result from those potions from the war or from some other buried trouble that has left him as Dodd puts it ���aberrated.�۝ There is certainly pain in Freddie�۪s past including a lost love (Madisen Beaty) summoned to the screen during a therapeutic session with Dodd. But no single cause could account for the tangle of tics and urges that make up Freddie�۪s personality. Mr. Phoenix his shoulders hunched his speech barely intelligible his face twisted pushes his performance beyond the psychological gestures of the Method (which was very much in vogue in the early days of Dianetics) into a zone of pure feral improvisatory being." in contrast presents an integrated highly nuanced supremely Methodical self to the camera. The two actors work in a counterpoint that expresses not only the diverging temperaments of the men they are playing but also some of the contradictions of their era. Dodd (whose name is rarely uttered aloud in the film) is to himself and his followers the very incarnation of success with the discipline of a scientist and the drive of an entrepreneur." driven by vanity and paranoia as much as by any rational ambition. And Freddie however damaged he may be is at the same time a person of unquestionable sincerity. Neither he nor Dodd is a stable singular entity. Each is in turn hero and villain master and disciple con man and patsy." the latest of the Master�۪s several wives and the hidden hand that directs his empire. Peggy who is either pregnant or holding a child in almost all of her scenes embodies a familiar feminine ideal and Ms. Adams does nothing to subvert the image of a perfect mother and helpmeet. What she does is show plainly and gracefully how the pursuit of such perfection can be monstrous." though occasionally someone ��� in particular Dodd�۪s cynical son Val (Jesse Plemons) ��� will sound a note of common sense. But common sense does not much interest Mr. Anderson who glimpses the reflection of his own ambition in the aspirations of his characters and who rewrites the rules of filmmaking at will." �۝ a tale of righteous revenge starring Adam Sandler probably comes closest ��� but all of Mr. Anderson�۪s six feature films to date are at least partially meditations on the American West. ���Hard Eight�۝ takes place in Reno; ���Boogie Nights �۝ ���Magnolia�۝ and ���Punch-Drunk Love�۝ in the San Fernando Valley; and ���There Will be Blood�۝ in the oil fields of Southern California. ���The Master�۝ travels east ��� to New York Philadelphia and England ��� but its geographic touchstones are the Pacific Ocean and the Arizona desert." and at every point in history Mr. Anderson discovers the perpetual promise of new beginnings and a poisonous backwash of anomie violence and greed. In his world fortunes are constantly being made and squandered. New religions are springing to life. Gamblers pornographers hustlers and drunks are plumbing the mysteries of existence. Fathers are at war with their biological and symbolic sons. Husbands are at war with wives. Men are at war with the universe perversely convinced that they have a chance of winning." tragic grotesque and beautiful ��� can feel like too much. ���The Master�۝ is wild and enormous its scale almost commensurate with Lancaster Dodd�۪s hubris and its soul nearly as restless as Freddie Quell�۪s. It is a movie about the lure and folly of greatness that comes as close as anything I�۪ve seen recently to being a great movie. There will be skeptics but the cult is already forming. Count me in." sex smoking and drinking much of it in a dubious cause."

�۝ a sleek entertainment about how very good greed can be is a fairy tale masquerading as a tragedy. It pivots on Robert Miller (Richard Gere) a shifty hedge-fund manager and 21st-century robber baron who�۪s foxed his way to the top of New York�۪s moneyed classes. Charmed and charming with a quicksilver stride and the self-possession of a man accustomed to hearing the word yes Robert lives in a rarefied world of private jets live-in help and seven-figure checks made out to favorite charities. Masterworks adorn his Gramercy Park mansion where a multistory crystal chandelier cascades in the foyer like a waterfall of diamonds." at least from the outside where most of us will be pressing our noses against the screen to watch the beautiful and not yet damned. It�۪s a world that the writer and director Nicholas Jarecki knows intimately (his father is the philanthropist Henry Jarecki) and captures efficiently. With pictorial precision he opens the film with Robert being interviewed ��� and smiling through words like bubble reality and bust ��� and then soaring in a plane where perched above the clouds he looks like the 1 percent god he is. Then it�۪s off to his mansion where bathed in golden light he blows out the candles on his 60th birthday and doles out kisses to his wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon) and daughter Brooke (Brit Marling)." after playfully flashing a copy of Forbes at Robert (he�۪s the cover boy) asks why he�۪s selling the company. That�۪s important information as is his leaving the party to join his lover Julie (Laetitia Casta) a character Mr. Jarecki unwisely tries to turn into an emblem of Robert�۪s duplicity. Yet even more instructive is how Robert waves away the magazine when Brooke shows it to him as if embarrassed by its display or superior to it. His little wave like the cut of his suits and luxurious hair make the point that he isn�۪t Donald Trump. Robert inhabits wealth; he doesn�۪t flaunt it. His is a kingly provenance and that gesture is a sign of his power." �۝ from the parade of artworks (Brice Marden Fernando Botero Marilyn Minter) to the soft lighting that softens every facial crease. The insistently moving cameras that tag alongside Robert convey his supreme ease of movement ��� nothing and no one is off limits to him ��� while also intimating an underlying tension. (The excellent director of photography is Yorick Le Saux a longtime collaborator of the French filmmaker Olivier Assayas.) Mr. Gere is one of cinema�۪s great walkers graced with a suggestively predatory physical suppleness and he slips through the movie like a panther. He�۪s the film�۪s most deluxe item." but his beauty and long-cultivated sympathetic screen presence make it harder for Mr. Jarecki to create the complexity that he�۪s after. (Movie stars pull you in no matter how ostensibly vile their characters.) The busy plot doesn�۪t help. Robert has cooked the books and is trying to sell his company before he�۪s exposed. His dirty dealing should be a richly exploitable topical subject but instead of digging into the psychology and morality of greed Mr. Jarecki only glances and lectures in that direction before piling on a lot of melodramatic complications including a death an investigation and a cynical detective (Tim Roth). These days it seems the illegal manipulation of hundreds of millions of dollars simply isn�۪t enough to incite moral outrage." money and deeds."

But Jacobs the great 20th-century philosopher-evangelist of urban life would surely recognize this retired restaurant cook a resident of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans and the subject of Jonathan Demme�۪s marvelous new documentary as an indispensable ���public character.�۝ With her stubborn attachment to place her vigilant sympathetic ���eyes on the street�۝ and her unsentimental civic-mindedness Ms. Parker is the exactly the kind of person Jacobs identified as crucial to the life of great American cities." also known as the City That Care Forgot has needed extra care since Hurricane Katrina. And it has received a lot of loving (if sometimes self-serving) attention from writers artists filmmakers and movie stars. The storm and its aftermath have inspired some impressive feats of storytelling both terrible and inspiring. Some ��� like Spike Lee�۪s documentary ���When the Levees Broke�۝ and David Simon�۪s HBO series ���Treme�۝ ��� offer detailed collective portraits of a metropolis in crisis. Others zero in on individual stories hoping to illuminate the city�۪s complex fate through the experiences of particular citizens. Dave Eggers�۪s ���Zeitoun�۝ ��� the true account of one man�۪s ordeal in the chaotic midst of the flooding ��� is perhaps the supreme prose example of this approach (even though its protagonist�۪s life subsequently took a bizarre turn)." ���I�۪m Carolyn Parker: The Good the Mad and the Beautiful �۝ belongs on a virtual shelf alongside Mr. Eggers�۪s book though it has a looser more episodic structure. (For a broader story you might check out ���The Fight for Home �۝ a richly reported new book about post-Katrina New Orleans by Daniel Wolff a producer of this film.) Every few months over a roughly five-year period Mr. Demme and his crew pay a friendly informal visit to Ms. Parker and her family. They check on the state of her health and her morale observe the progress (or lack thereof) of repairs to her handsome double-shotgun house and accompany her on her daily routines. She has always a lot to say: about her own life and the spirited self-reliant philosophy that has guided her through it; about the history of racism and poverty afflicting the city she loves; about her continuing struggle to recover a semblance of normal life after Katrina." Kyrah ��� Mr. Demme is a discreet but important presence. You occasionally hear his voice from behind the camera or catch sight of his sweptback silver hair. He sits in Ms. Parker�۪s FEMA trailer watching the Saints play football. He eats her fried chicken and looks at old family photographs. These quiet relaxed appearances do nothing to upstage Ms. Parker but they add a warm personal dimension to the film. You are not just observing somebody�۪s life but spending time in her company." and a reminder of Mr. Demme�۪s unassuming ardent humanism a quality displayed in his recent fictional features (notably ���Rachel Getting Married�۝) as well as in his documentaries about Haiti Neil Young and Jimmy Carter. Ms. Parker now in her 60s is a funny prickly insightful repository of good sense and local history and you can understand why professional duties notwithstanding Mr. Demme is always eager to see her again. But their evident friendship is also integral to the movie�۪s subtle powerful argument which is that Katrina was not ��� should not be for any American ��� something that happened to strangers." �۝ which will be shown on PBS next month after its theatrical run implicitly counters the narrowness of our current political discourse which seems often to rest on a brittle dichotomy between the individual and the state. Ms. Parker is unflagging in defense of her property her community her family and ��� in a crucial subplot ��� her church. Her post-Katrina struggle also testifies to the value of civic solidarity to the persistence of racism and to the need for a helpful and responsive government. This is not to say that she is capable of resolving the conflicts and contradictions that continue to plague New Orleans and the rest of the country. She has her hands full with matters close to home. But she is undoubtedly someone you should know."

He seems fickle and impatient hanging up on potential partners at the first hint that the chemistry might be wrong but eventually he finds more or less what he is looking for. Quite a bit more actually in the person of Paul (Zachary Booth) even though Paul says he has a steady girlfriend and Erik is not interested in commitment." �۝ Ira Sachs�۪s sensitive knowing new film (his fifth feature) follows Erik and Paul for more than a decade during which their relationship blossoms withers and renews itself like a perennial flower with a peculiar and unpredictable life cycle." but they don�۪t necessarily seem like a promising couple and not just because Paul is ostensibly straight. That is a minor detail in the greater scheme of things. The more significant obstacle appears to be a temperamental difference." who has been desultorily working on a documentary about an avant-garde New York filmmaker is something of a flake in work and love. His best female friend (Julianne Nicholson) worries indulgently about him. His sister (Paprika Steen) scolds him about his lack of direction warning him that being ���up and coming�۝ is not an appropriate condition for a man in his 30s. With his gap-tooth smile laid-back posture and unkempt blond hair Erik seems locked in perpetual irresponsible boyhood." in contrast presents a more conventionally grown-up face to the world. He is organized ambitious and professionally well-established with an important job in book publishing. But one of the most ingenious and convincing aspects of Mr. Sachs�۪s film is the way it allows the characters to move in surprising directions upending our expectations and their own sense of who they are individually and to each other." in danger of losing everything ��� Erik his job his life ��� to drug addiction. And Erik at first glance a freer more hedonistic spirit with a wandering eye and an eager libido turns out to be a more disciplined and steadfast fellow than anyone might have supposed. He grows out of his dilettantism and promiscuity even as Paul slides perilously in the other direction." episodic story ��� makes ���Keep the Lights On�۝ sound much more schematic more like a morality tale than it really is. Its subject is not addiction or ambition or even love in a conventional romantic sense but rather the more elusive and intriguing matter of intimacy: how it grows falters and endures over time. The dialogue sometimes has a canned hectoring sound as if the actors had been called upon to announce their feelings rather than express them but the look mood and rhythm of the film are exquisitely even thrillingly authentic. In scenes that jump from year to year and linger over significant ordinary moments Mr. Sachs captures the ways strangers turn into lovers and the equally scary and exciting ways that lovers can remain strangers." sympathetic emotional exploration ���Keep the Lights On�۝ invites comparison to Andrew Haigh�۪s ���Weekend �۝ perhaps the best big-screen love story ��� gay or straight vampire or human ��� in recent memory. That film seemed to telescope a universe of romantic possibility into a single 72-hour stretch during which a one-night stand between two young British men grew into a profound life-altering and yet still elusive connection. Mr. Sachs takes a longer view but the films share an interest in mapping the nuances of feeling that arise between men for whom sex is the easy part. They also both examine the complexities of gay life at a time when closets have (mostly) emptied the threat of AIDS has (largely) diminished and the tide of intolerance has (significantly) receded." the implicit bond that develops between the couple on the screen and the people in the audience. Even more than ���Forty Shades of Blue�۝ and ���Married Life �۝ his two most recent films (both well worth watching if you haven�۪t already) ���Keep the Lights On�۝ feels as if it�۪s about people you know. I don�۪t mean that Paul and Erik are recognizable types ��� since I�۪ve never met a Danish documentary filmmaker I couldn�۪t really say ��� but rather the opposite. They are so real so specific that by the end of the film you feel implicated in their lives close to them precisely because after all this time you still don�۪t understand them completely."

A simple story intricately told it centers on a small familial group ��� a doll named Buttercup a teddy bear a marionette and a blob ��� whose happy life is threatened by a bust of a bald man that looks as if it once sat on a pedestal in Communist Party headquarters. The bust is attended to by a motley assortment of minions including what looks like a termite with a human head and a severed arm wearing a black leather glove which suggests that the director Jiri Barta is a Stanley Kubrick fan." and less well known at least in the United States. ���Toys in the Attic�۝ isn�۪t as unsettling as Mr. Svankmajer�۪s work but even in this English-language version it�۪s scarcely a cute and cuddly family film of the generic type often foisted on American tots. Leaving a screening a colleague remarked that it may not be right for children though much depends on the kid. In truth the movie should be manna for anyone who likes animated fantasias without wisecracks commercials and overwrought warbling about self-actualization meaning that it�۪s suitable for those who will grow up either to be the next Tim Burton or simply to enjoy his movies." though it does turn on a story of good versus evil if one executed with paper bits and chess pieces oiled gears and chalked lines as well as a great deal of meticulously executed stop-motion animation. Written by Mr. Barta and Edgar Dutka it opens with Buttercup (voiced by Vivian Schilling who did the English-language adaptation) bustling around the old suitcase where she lives with Teddy (Forest Whitaker); Sir Handsome (Cary Elwes) a marionette who�۪s something of a Don Quixote figure; and a lump Laurent (Marcelo Tubert) who looks like a Mr. Potato Head made out of clay and the stub of a pencil. The story such as it is kicks in after Buttercup makes breakfast and Sir and Teddy head off to work and play." leading Teddy Sir Handsome and Laurent to dash stumble and bumble to her rescue. Things improve at least on the level of sex roles and stereotypes with the endlessly resourceful Madame Curie (Joan Cusack) a mouse whose miraculous way with transforming everyday objects into extraordinary ones suggests that she�۪s a surrogate for Mr. Barta. Madame Curie tosses out an occasional word in Yiddish and may be a nod to ���Maus �۝ Art Spiegelman�۪s graphic epic about the Holocaust.

A quick shot of doll hands boiling in a pot appears to confirm the vague worst. Given that the legs don�۪t have hands they may be eating their own bodies which suggests that there may be a metaphor afloat here ��� something about the folly of those who devour their own ��� in between some glorious imagery and what is finally a sweet little story."

entertaining yarn that doesn�۪t bear close scrutiny. Even superficial examination of this film reveals myriad flaws despite a compelling performance by Jeremy Irons as a fictional writer in a book also called ���The Words.�۝ At the heart of this story-within-a-story is a tale of plagiarism and ambition." ���The Words�۝ addresses some of the same themes as Woody Allen�۪s ���You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.�۝ Its story of a manuscript lost at a Paris railway station parallels that of Ernest Hemingway�۪s first wife Hadley Richardson who lost track of a suitcase containing some of his manuscripts in 1922. Hemingway who is pretentiously referred to throughout the film never forgave her." a successful author whose pulpy new novel ���The Words �۝ contains some of the most wooden prose ever ascribed to a writer of supposed reputation. Mr. Quaid�۪s slow droning line readings make the writing sound even more flat-footed than it might otherwise seem." a shifty beady-eyed young writer whose two unpublished novels were politely rejected for flaws like being ���too interior.�۝ Married to a supportive wife Dora (Zo�� Saldana) Rory has settled into a job as a ���supervisor�۝ at a literary agency." during their honeymoon in Paris Dora gave Rory a battered satchel she picked up in an antiques shop. Only later does he open it to find a yellowed unsigned manuscript. Reading it he is spellbound and envious. Because his writing career is going nowhere he eventually decides to copy the novel into his computer and pass it off as his own work calling it ���The Window Tears �۝ and a star is born." �۝ as the character in the book is called. Stooped gaunt and unshaven with long stringy hair and a hollow penetrating gaze this codger engages Rory in conversation. As the Old Man slyly reveals his identity without giving his name Rory�۪s eyes widen with alarm." and the movie flashes back (in sepia-toned scenes) to the 1940s when he was a Young Man (Ben Barnes) in Paris who married a beautiful French waitress (Nora Arnezeder) and had a baby girl with her. After the baby dies the Young Man pounds out ���The Window Tears�۝ during a two-week fit of grief and rage. But just before the Young Man returns to the United States his wife loses the manuscript. (The French scenes although well acted make up a compendium of clich̩s about Americans abroad after the war.)" Rory is wracked with shame and fear and he is belatedly forced to contemplate the moral and ethical issues surrounding his theft and how to handle the catastrophic fallout should the truth be made public. He is further shamed by the Old Man�۪s refusal to accept any financial settlement." a Columbia student and an avid literary groupie whose manner is so predatory that you wonder if she is some sort of spy. In their conversations Clay hints that the crimes described in his book might be his own story but the movie remains frustratingly coy." the connection to the real world of authors and publishers feels tenuous. On the subject of plagiarism the movie portentously beats its chest and tears out its hair in overblown speeches about theft identity fiction and reality that ring with self-congratulatory piety." I think would be to give too much credit to a film that is ultimately less interested in morality and ethics than in maintaining suspense by any means necessary."

In the middle of the mayhem in between the stomping and punching he overhears one of the rampaging goons say ���The city is ours�۝ and repeat the word ours ours ours. There�۪s a sense that the rioting is a kind of postcolonial invasion for at least this one thug an idea that�۪s cemented when later he says ���We took the city.�۝" �۝ a nearly laugh-free British comedy about four teenage boys who travel to Malia in Crete to drink and have sex and then drink some more when they don�۪t have sex. Even so there�۪s a noticeable thuggish undertow to the scenes of the teenagers boozing and sometimes spewing their way through a foreign city amid hundreds of their similarly sodden wretched and retching countrymen and women. Like the soccer hooligans these partygoers take a city though here they mount the invasion through kinder gentler inebriation. The four teenagers also attempt a parallel assault of anything with breasts and a vagina a literal offensive that follows a familiar loutish formula: insult women individually and collectively and then charm them (ha)." which may explain why one of the more tolerable Simon (Joe Thomas) wonders why he�۪s pals with one of the most egregious Jay (James Buckley). Good question. The answer is that the four met (as characters) on a popular British sitcom also called ���The Inbetweeners �۝ which ran from 2008 to 2010 and on the evidence of a few early shows was better than this extended-play version. (It�۪s currently streaming on Netflix.)

They may also be headed toward a sequel: The movie is apparently the most popular British comedy in history. I guarantee that its success has nothing to do with the quality of the actual movie which was directed by Ben Palmer and written by the show�۪s creators Iain Morris and Damon Beesley. Whether the ���Inbetweeners�۝ movie will translate for Americans will be mildly interesting but it doesn�۪t really matter because its brand has already made its mark.

Much as she has in the past Elizabeth Hunter (Charlotte Rampling) an Australian matriarch lords over all including her servants and two children Basil (Geoffrey Rush) and Dorothy (Judy Davis) who have returned to her reluctantly skittishly to secure their inheritance. During their visit Elizabeth fades in and out by turns raging and murmuring as she fights the world her seemingly ungrateful children and maybe herself." �۝ to borrow a phrase from ���King Lear �۝ looms in Fred Schepisi�۪s dramatically unsteady blustery if likable film which was adapted by Judy Morris from the Patrick White novel. (The book was first published in 1973 the year White was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died in 1990.) Shakespeare�۪s ���old and foolish�۝ king is initially invoked in connection with Basil an actor who has made his name abroad. His Lear however has been trounced by the critics as his mother slyly remarks soon after he first visits her. Mother or ���Mummy �۝ as Dorothy calls her ��� using a humorous pronunciation that invokes the image of Boris Karloff staggering about in ragged bandages ��� may be fading. But Elizabeth remains a force and like Lear she�۪s not going quickly or quietly." moments of comedy and an undergirding of tragedy opens up into a tale of love family identity and its confusions. That at any rate seems the idea as Basil and Dorothy noisily hover over their mother�۪s bed and the story. Watching the two fuss fidget scheme and complain it�۪s apparent why Mr. Rush and Ms. Davis who rarely do anything unobtrusively on screen were cast opposite Ms. Rampling whose beauty and watchful stillness can function as a powerful centripetal force. Mr. Schepisi encourages Mr. Rush and Ms. Davis�۪s sometimes entertaining excesses and matches them with his own flourishes like a cutaway to one of Basil�۪s eyes in close-up." Mr. Schepisi whose earlier films include ���A Cry in the Dark�۝ and ���Roxanne �۝ can be fearless when it comes to metaphor. There are a lot of busy eyes and eyeballing in the film as well as a cataclysmic epiphanic storm. Mr. Schepisi forces the theater imagery harder than he needs to with characters flinging open curtains at the beginning of the film and snapping them shut at the end. This isn�۪t a film in which anything including a simple household gesture like opening drapes happens inconspicuously. To that same embellished end clothes are also laid out like costumes makeup is applied and wigs adjusted in a needless amplification of the unilluminating idea that Elizabeth and her children are all playing roles. Who doesn�۪t?" Ms. Davis and Mr. Rush play their parts well and certainly vigorously. They make for agreeably watchable sometimes amusing spectacles even though there�۪s no disguising that their characters are the usual dreary family-circle causalities. Basil and Dorothy resent Elizabeth for both familiar and some rather more uncommon grievances." most justifiable beef with their mother is that she�۪s so much more interesting more vital and complexly shaded than they are. Whether she�۪s lying in bed her gray hair spilling out around her head or exalting in existence itself during one of several flashbacks Elizabeth draws you in which works for the story and simultaneously unbalances it."

But ���Hello I Must Be Going�۝ (which shares its title with a Phil Collins album and a famous number from the Marx Brothers movie ���Animal Crackers�۝) is better than the story it has to tell and that is thanks to the bravery and sensitivity of Ms. Lynskey�۪s performance and the sweet intense love affair that is the film�۪s main concern." strained dinner party at which members of the older generation ��� including the young man�۪s superattached mother (Julie White) ��� are oblivious to the sexual spark that ignites between the two young people at the table." late-adolescent restlessness awakens some of Amy�۪s dormant enthusiasm for life and his headlong infatuation with her does wonders for her self-esteem." there are complications some farcical some belonging more to the realm of therapeutic melodrama. This is ultimately a tale of affirmation self-acceptance and second chances and its lessons while not unwelcome are a bit too forced and neatly packaged to make it fully satisfying.

But as is so often the case with digital technology of all kinds ��� the tablet the mp3 the Internet itself ��� the discourse tilts toward triumphalism." which in this case offers convenience and portability as well as up-to-the-minute coolness. There is something inherently appealing about belonging to the party of progress and quite a few of the cinema artists Mr. Reeves interviews make their preferences for pixels and CGI sound like matters of principle. They see themselves as a vanguard pressing forward with innovations that are aesthetic as well as technological if such a distinction even makes sense anymore." whose history is measured in leaps and bounds of discovery and invention. From the earliest days many of the important directors were conducting a kind of research-and-development program for the medium experimenting with parallel editing and montage as much as with genre thinking about light and focus as much as about acting. They also needed to adapt in order to keep their careers going since big changes ��� the arrival of sound of color of wide-screen of television ��� were rapid and frequent." it makes sense that the latest and arguably the biggest change should be embraced not only by confirmed futurists like James Cameron and Lana and Andy Wachowski but also by directors like Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Soderbergh who are steeped in reverence for the movie past. Mr. Scorsese�۪s ���Hugo�۝ ��� a 3-D digital extravaganza about George M̩li̬s the early-20th-century stage magician turned special-effects pioneer ��� is a perfect expression of the idea that embracing the new has the essence of cinematic tradition from the start." and the very presence of Mr. Reeves (a producer of ���Side by Side�۝ as well as its narrator and master of ceremonies) might be taken as a declaration of digital allegiance. He�۪s Neo after all whose travels between physical and virtual dimensions in ���The Matrix�۝ ��� in its moment a groundbreaking work of digital cinema ��� can be seen as prophetic at least with respect to the movies." and it still has its partisans. The most passionate and prominent here is Mr. Nolan whose ���Dark Knight�۝ series needed the luster of darkness that only emulsion and stock can provide. He and others are skeptical of digital utopianism and also worried that accumulated wisdom and long-standing rituals of the craft are in danger of being swept away." even invisible to most fans. Some filmmakers are pleased that dailies ��� the scenes and shots collected in a day�۪s work ��� can now be reviewed instantly whereas before they had to be sent to the lab for full processing overnight. Others and some rather vocal cinematographers worry that the instant version sacrifices precision and vision on the altar of convenience. Similar arguments are joined about editing and color timing." who has spent most of his adult life on movie sets is comfortable in high-powered company and also as every actor must be a good listener. ���Side by Side �۝ while far from a comprehensive consideration of the current state of movies is necessary viewing for anyone who cares about their future. Mr. Kenneally might have paid more attention to the world beyond Hollywood and also to the impact of digital technology on lower-budget independent filmmaking and on restoration but within the parameters it defines this film does an excellent job of presenting complex material in an enlightening and exciting manner." since the revolution is in its early stages. For now the mix of agnosticism and optimism ��� of respect for the old and enthusiasm for the new ��� seems reasonable. But we will have to wait for the sequel to know for sure."

���Lawless�۝ ��� written by Nick Cave ��� is based on a true-story novel called ���The Wettest County in the World �۝ by Matt Bondurant. The area in question is Franklin County Va. and in 1931 when most of the action in the film takes place it was a bloody paradise of bootleggers. This picturesque corner of Appalachia has now provided a bonanza for dialect coaches and their charges who set the hills alive with a symphony of dropped consonants and attenuated vowels almost as violent as the gunfire that periodically erupts." forebears of the author of ���The Wettest County�۝ and upholders of a stubborn mountain code of independence and honor. Forrest the taciturn would-be patriarch is played by Tom Hardy who was born in London. Howard his drunk and volatile enforcer is played by the Australian actor Jason Clarke. The twitchy weak-willed runt of the litter Jack is our own Shia LaBeouf." which stretches the already thin credibility of the idea that they might be kin. Mr. Clarke does a bit of howling but not much chatting. Mr. LaBeouf as is his custom runs his mouth in as many directions as possible while Mr. Hardy mostly grunts growls and ribbits occasionally interrupting his angry bullfrog impersonation to deliver down-home bromides that make him sound like Toby Keith choking on a Cheeto." a carnival of mayhem and period detail ��� visually suggesting Walker Evans ���Bonnie and Clyde �۝ ���Miller�۪s Crossing�۝ and ���The Beverly Hillbillies�۝ ��� exactly insists on realism. Nor in spite of gruesome killings and boisterous car chases does it hew to the conventions of the period gangster genre. It is instead a sprawling evocation of a vaguely rendered time and place as crowded as an episode of ���Hee Haw�۝ and occasionally as much fun." especially when a Chicago lawman named Rakes (Guy Pearce) a sadist with slicked-down hair chalk-striped suits and remarkable diction starts to muscle in on the local moonshine action. When the Bondurants refuse to play by his rules ��� preferring to deal directly with a mob boss (Gary Oldman) ��� a nasty little war breaks out. Faces are pummeled; throats are cut; and shotguns hunting knives and brass knuckles are put to grisly use." there are inklings of romance (and flashes of bared skin) between Forrest and Maggie (Jessica Chastain) a redhead who shows up one day in flight from the corruptions of the big city to take a job pouring coffee in the cafe that serves as the Bondurants�۪ headquarters." meanwhile courts Bertha (Mia Wasikowska) the daughter of a local preacher. As he and his brothers expand their business ��� with the help of their frail young neighbor Cricket (Dane DeHaan) ��� Jack develops a taste for flashy clothes and cars affecting Cagneyesque mannerisms even though he is not nearly as tough as Forrest or Howard." bouncing between rollicking backwoods humor and graphic violence with a dollop of good-old-boys sentimentality thrown in for good measure. It has neither the stripped-down intensity of ���The Proposition �۝ Mr. Hillcoat and Mr. Cave�۪s 2006 outback western nor the lyrical austerity of ���The Road �۝ Mr. Hillcoat�۪s not bad 2009 adaptation of Cormac McCarthy�۪s postapocalyptic parable." and interesting themes and anecdotes are scattered around without being fully explored. This is weak and cloudy moonshine: it doesn�۪t burn or intoxicate." killin�۪ gittin�۪ nekkid."

Beyond that there is no why no where and hardly a how to the action here. Between long stretches of nothingness come scenes that are full of brutality but almost never tension ��� the deaths are video-game quick and just as untheatrical even in the battle royale that brings the action to a close." borderline-feminist moment midway through when it seems as if Mary (Ashley Bell) and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) might wrest control of the group ��� or take on each other ��� the hunted behave bizarrely: sometimes blithe sometimes crumbling never convincing." ���The Day�۝ looks radiant and parched as if shot through a grisaille Instagram filter ��� it�۪s blandly pretty as post-apocalypses go.

It�۪s buoyant dumb-fun a ticking-clock thriller about a New York bicycle messenger who has to get from here to there without being taken out. Stuffed with zingers and zippy stunts it comes with pretty young things of all hues and hair types ��� few prettier than its lead Joseph Gordon-Levitt ��� and start-to-finish clever special effects none more clever or special than Michael Shannon. If you want to see a political undertow in its urban band of multicultural renegades there�۪s that for the taking too." having grabbed the Crazy Man baton from Christopher Walken enters teeth gnashing eyes bulging to play Bobby Monday a bad bad New York detective. Monday has a gambling problem and as he freely confesses issues with impulse control. He�۪s also a big-time loser who�۪s deep in dangerous debt. His deliverance may come in a mysterious chit that will lead to a payout that in turn involves a money-lending outfit; a visiting student Nima (Jamie Chung); some cuteness back in mainland China; and other easily forgotten particulars. None of these story bits matter much because it�۪s the telling and not the tale ��� along with Mr. Gordon-Levitt�۪s innate appeal Mr. Shannon�۪s volatile menace and a certain je ne say what ��� that makes the movie pop." who has to race it from uptown to down while biking a gantlet of darting cars buses trucks and pedestrians and dodging Bobby Monday and other obstacles including the obligatory girl trouble Vanessa (Dania Ramirez). Wilee who zigs zags and rarely stops ��� the camera flying parallel with him or perched on his handlebars or next to his feet ��� is also known as Coyote as in Wile E. Coyote a moniker that makes sense even if he�۪s closer to Road Runner without the beep beep. But then Wilee no surprise is too cool for beeps or for that matter gears. He rides a fixie a bike with only a single gear secured to the rear wheel." Wilee also rides without brakes a choice that�۪s branded by other characters in the movie as reckless and maybe evidence of a death wish. But it also registers on screen ��� as when Wilee like a groovier or at least thinner Fred Flintstone skids to a stop using only his skill and sneakered feet ��� as the ultimate in authenticity. To a degree the director David Koepp has tried to mirror the DIY ethos of fixed-gear devotees by using real rather than digital stunts and effects. There are digital cars and occasional passers-by scattered amid the remarkably clean streets of New York ��� as well as a lot of interstitial Google-map-style sections that zoom out for an aerial view and in for the street view ��� but most of the imagery is analogue. The movie tries hard to look real." with digitally created and enhanced spectacle being deployed alongside actual bodies moving through bouncing off and slamming into the physical world. These practical stunts function somewhat like collecting vinyl records taking up sewing baking your own bread handwriting thank you notes and stripping down your Schwinn in that they�۪re reassuring totems of a reality that at times seems to be disappearing in the slipstream of digital ones and zeros. When Wilee pumps up a steep Central Park hill Mr. Gordon-Levitt�۪s straining muscles pouring sweat and heavy breathing function as visible evidence of both the actor�۪s hard physical labor and his actual (not avatar) being." of course also show that Wilee has the guts and lasting power to take the movie to its inevitable end. (Why he doesn�۪t just hitch a ride on the subway though is a mystery.) Mr. Koepp with help from the bike-nation cavalry gets him there easily. A writer on a number of heavyweight hits (���Jurassic Park �۝ etc.) Mr. Koepp has also directed a handful of dark twisty thrillers. He showed a lighter directorial touch with his last effort ���Ghost Town �۝ a screwballish comedy with ghosts and has continued to let in air and light with ���Premium Rush.�۝ Working from a loose casually funny script he wrote with John Kamps Mr. Koepp has found the right balance here between genre seriousness and un-self-seriousness to turn the disposable into the enjoyable."

�۝ Kleber Mendon̤a Filho�۪s revelatory debut feature takes place mostly on a wealthy block in the northeastern Brazilian city of Recife. Identical gleaming white high-rises ��� some with fancy names like Vivaldi Westminster and Camille Claudel ��� dominate the skyline obscuring the nearby ocean and also the urban poverty that has been central to Brazil�۪s social and cinematic identity for decades." with their freshly painted walls sleek appliances and large flat-screen televisions look like generic enclaves of privilege. We might be anywhere. And some of the events that occur inside those walls could be episodes in a global soap opera of domestic banality set in Singapore or San Francisco or Cape Town or Dubai. An exasperated housewife whose children are tutored in English and Mandarin tries to silence the barking dog next door; a rich man�۪s maid has an affair with a security guard; residents hold a meeting to complain about a doorman who has been sleeping on the job." and you notice just how much labor ��� ironing clothes refilling water coolers delivering packages opening doors selling drugs ��� goes into maintaining the leisure class in its life of ease. But Mr. Mendon̤a a former film critic whose command of the medium is both formidable and subtle is up to something more than the usual upstairs-downstairs comedy of colliding destinies in a small place. The scope of his movie is narrow but its ambitions are enormous and it accomplishes nothing less than the illumination of the peculiar state of Brazilian (and not only Brazilian) society." each with the word ���guard�۝ in the title and one of the movie�۪s themes is the intimate relationship between security and paranoia. There are metal grates and surveillance cameras and also a private force of muscular men in brown vests patrolling the street at night. Their leader is Clodoaldo (Irandhir Santos) a smooth-talking salesman whose friendly reassurances have a strangely menacing undercurrent. In any case the anxiety that it is his job to dispel (and perhaps also to inspire) never really goes away and neither does the haunting sense that something terrible is always lurking just beyond the frame. It may be that the more protection you have the less safe you feel." and it exposes a world of complex relationships and simmering contradictions. And also of ordinary people going about their daily business. Jọo (Gustavo Jahn) wakes up with Sofia (Irma Brown) after their first night together and their bliss is marred by the discovery that the CD player has been stolen from Sofia�۪s car. Jọo suspects that the thief is his cousin Dinho (Yuri Holanda) the black sheep of a big powerful family ruled by Jọo and Dinho�۪s grandfather Francisco (W. J. Solha). Most of the real estate we survey in ���Neighboring Sounds�۝ belongs to Francisco who also owns a grand crumbling sugar plantation in the countryside." it may seem like a picturesque excursion a scenic break from the sterile high-rises of Recife. But the plantation is hardly a neutral tourist destination. In a recent interview in The New York Times Mr. Mendon̤a said that he wanted to move away from the urban slums and rural landscapes that have defined Brazilian cinema since the 1960s and to explore the realities of a newly prosperous and fast-growing nation. He has done that but he also shows how those older other Brazils persist and cast their shadows across the shiny surfaces of modernity." it is sound that carries unsettling implications of danger. We always hear more than we see: footsteps upstairs or outside; sirens and crashes in the night; whispering voices and humming machines. With his sound designer Pablo Lamar Mr. Mendon̤a has created the aural landscape of a horror movie." for much of its running time a thriller without a plot. The tension that suffuses the routines of everyday life is as hard to identify as it is to avoid so that a late swerve toward violence while surprising also seems inevitable the silent turn of an invisible wheel of fate. No one can quite see or hear what is coming but something is out there just on the other side of the whatever we think keeps us safe."

All four appear to have loving surrogate families but we barely hear from them and their motives for the adoption remain veiled. Similarly though China�۪s one-child policy is blamed for the surge in availability of baby girls after 1979 the truth is more complicated and would have made for a more nuanced and enlightening narrative." whose identification with their homeland varies according to personality and how they have been reared. Feelings of abandonment are discussed at length but not the grinding poverty and social pressures behind many a birthparent�۪s painful decision. And in the rare instances when sharp edges do appear ��� as when we briefly hear from a man representing an organization uneasy with transnational adoption ��� the film slides past instead of grabbing on." the question falling like a bomb in the crowded happy gathering.

�۝ an approach to making and reproducing photographs that would protect both the meaning of particular pictures and the integrity of the reality they depict. Since the 1970s when the essays in Sontag�۪s book were written the global glut of images has grown almost beyond measure. In the age of Instagram and Google Earth it is easy to believe ��� it is sometimes hard not to believe ��� that every inch of the planet every human face and patch of wilderness has been snapped up and uploaded. We have seen it all." ���Samsara �۝ shot in a grand and vibrant 70-millimeter format ��� including some remarkable time-lapse photography ��� is partly a Sontagian case for sustainability. Or to adapt the food-obsessed ecological language of the moment it presents a visual argument for slow looking for careful meditative attention to what is seen. A spool of arresting beautifully composed shots without narration or dialogue ���Samsara�۝ is an invitation to watch closely and to suspend interpretation (another notion Sontag might have approved)." and perhaps undermined by their sheer abundance and variety. His camera seems to float through the world hovering above rivers oceans and forests and then alighting on nearly every continent." behind the camera and in the editing room (where he worked with the film�۪s producer Mark Magidson) for reflections and patterns. The structure of ���Samsara �۝ which is propelled by the breathy resonant hum of music by Michael Stearns Lisa Gerrard and Marcello De Francisci is like that of a poem or a sonata a complex tissue of rhymes and motifs." �۝ and a loose and sometimes playful sense of the connectedness of everything pervades its 99 minutes. Traveling across 25 countries to cities and rural outposts you are invited to notice resemblances. People in factories and animals in factory farms worshipers and prisoners dancers and undulating waves ��� these things exist in a visual and choreographic harmony that allows you to infer themes that link them: work in the global economy the state of the environment the interactions and collisions between industry and nature." they may also be familiar especially if you have been keeping up with the recent spate of documentaries that investigate the state of the modern world. The chickens and pigs in processing plants might remind you of ���Food Inc. �۝ while shots of crowded third-world slums Chinese sulfur mines and transvestite prostitutes seem drawn from the lexicon of photojournalism and cinematic consciousness-raising." it seems to make more and to produce a context that will make them strange rather than obvious to the point of invisibility. Mr. Fricke did something like that 20 years ago with his film ���Baraka �۝ a precursor to ���Samsara �۝ and both films owe a clear debt to the work of Godfrey Reggio on whose 1982 film ���Koyaanisqatsi�۝ Mr. Fricke worked as a cinematographer." with its Philip Glass music and its rapid cascade of intuitively associated images stands as a monument of socially conscious head-trip cinema. ���Baraka�۝ and ���Samsara�۝ seem in comparison more accessible and perhaps a little softer. While they do challenge the viewer�۪s habits of perception ��� wrenching us temporarily out of our addiction to story and into a state of reflective reverie ��� they are also likely to soothe as much as they provoke. The world ���Samsara�۝ gives us is strange and beautiful and in places disturbing but it also seems manageable even in its vastness and perhaps too easily consumed through beautiful images."

Attracted by their soccer-pitch synchronicity a scout for the Caracas Football Club offers them a tryout but Julio deeply embedded with a drug-dealing gang is more vulnerable to distractions than his straight-arrow sibling. When personal tragedy intervenes it�۪s left to Daniel to try to save both boys from the laws of the streets and the cruelties of circumstance." but this confident movie alternately volatile and tender coats its clich̩s in winningly natural performances and Enrique Aular�۪s kinetic photography. Game sequences hurtle forward in breathless bursts of motion and scenes between the boys and their loving single mother (Marcela Gir�_n who also plays in a soccer league in Caracas) are handled with warm authenticity. In the background the family�۪s precarious hillside shantytown (largely filmed in the Petare slums) has a smudged ominous impermanence.

By this I don�۪t mean that anyone is a teetotaler in ���Teddy Bear �۝ though Dennis�۪s breakfast slurry of nuked nutritional powder and egg whites is punishingly spartan.

Guided by hope and a handful of glossy brochures Dennis arrives in Pattaya on the east coast of Thailand where he soon makes his way to a bar. There he is greeted by the proprietor Scott (David Winters) who quickly asks Dennis what he likes in women breast size included." but Scott enters the movie shirtless and could easily wear a B cup himself so it�۪s also funny. Although there are times when this world of tight smiles monstrous maternity and hovering camerawork can feel too familiar Mr. Matthiesen has a way of consistently and gently upending expectations sometimes with humor. He also navigates the Pattaya bar scene with an equally welcome absence of defensiveness or condemnation. After scanning the mismatched pairs of older Western men and young Thai women Dennis decides that the scene isn�۪t for him a choice that leads him toward a friendly civilian Toi (Lamaiporn Sangmanee Hougaard) who owns a local bodybuilding gym where Dennis finds camaraderie and the movie enters a nice and easy sweet groove."

�۝ a beautiful-looking charmingly heartfelt 3-D stop-motion animation about a boy and his ghouls comes with an assortment of hair-raising frights. Some of these are just the flesh-and-blood people in Norman�۪s life the bullies and teachers and even relatives who with degrees of impatience and love chastise the 11-year-old for his unusually morbid habits. Norman a sprout whose black hair stands at attention as if he were in a state of perpetual alarm (he is voiced with vivid emotion by Kodi Smit-McPhee) can�۪t help but be a little creepy. After all he doesn�۪t just see dead people he also hangs out with them sometimes while watching creature-features on the family TV." especially given that the old lady busily knitting on the sofa in a lovely pool of bilious green is Norman�۪s grandmother and voiced by the incomparable Elaine Stritch? No one explains how Grandma with her watery form and needles died but she herself says she�۪s sticking around to keep an eye on him. It�۪s a good thing too given that no one else can see what Norman sees and everyone except for his gossamer granny and the assembly of loitering ghosts who jauntily greet him on his way to school seems to think he�۪s a nut. From the outside there really doesn�۪t seem to be much difference between Norman and a lot of under-age movie heroes. He�۪s diffident misjudged withdrawn. The best thing about him besides his looks is that he may actually be a nut." the Oregon studio that produced ���Coraline�۝ (2009) which was directed by Henry Selick and based on the Neil Gaiman novella. ���ParaNorman�۝ comes with somewhat less familiar brand names: Sam Fell who shares directing credit on ���ParaNorman�۝ with its screenwriter Chris Butler helped direct both ���Flushed Away�۝ (from Aardman Animations the British home of Wallace & Gromit) and ���The Tale of Despereaux�۝ (from Universal Pictures). Like the Aardman movies ���ParaNorman�۝ was made with physical puppets and sets and an almost tenderly stubborn insistence on the human touch. Computers figured into its production as they do on virtually every movie made these days but an enormous amount of handiwork was also involved effort that�۪s visible for instance in the meaningful lopsidedness of Norman�۪s nostrils and ears." �۝ including at Norman�۪s home where it can be hard for him to assert his individuality and quirks a struggle made amusingly literal in a shot in which he�۪s bookended by the plumped derri̬re of his loving mother Sandra (Leslie Mann) and the rounded belly of his exasperated father Perry (Jeff Garlin). Rather less amusing is Norman�۪s snappish older sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) a bubble-gum-pink nightmare who like the blustering bully at school Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) initially registers as disappointingly generic. There�۪s somewhat more to both Courtney and Alvin though over all the designs of all the characters from their globular and angular parts to their blotchy skin are more inspired than what lies beneath." from bristled hair to sneakered toe partly because he hasn�۪t been saddled with the familiar Disneyesque pluck and good cheer. He�۪s a morose boy watchful and wary with a darting gaze and hunched shoulders. The outsider hero alone and misunderstood has become an even bigger clich̩ in American movies than the old-fashioned nonneurotic protagonist was once upon a studio time. Norman certainly has demons (and zombies) but he isn�۪t just a bundle of idiosyncrasies waiting for his redemptive glory a therapeutic reckoning and a tribe of kooks to call his own (though do expect the expected). He�۪s also an unreconstructed little weirdo with pleasurably odd tics and a night light shaped like a monster head and topped with a pink brain." an amusing if not especially fresh tale involving a witch and some Puritans is principally a vehicle for the movie�۪s meticulously detailed pictorial beauty which turns each scene into an occasion for discovery and sometimes delight. Far more than Norman�۪s adventure which takes him from home to a cemetery and deep into his town�۪s history what pulls you in quickening your pulse and widening your eyes are the myriad visual enchantments ��� from the rich nubby tactility of his clothes to the skull-and-bones adorning his bedroom wallpaper. When Norman pauses while brushing his teeth to make a scary face in the mirror the foamy toothpaste dripping like zombie drool you may find yourself tapping into your own inner monster and goofily grinning right back." including one with the very angry ghost of a murdered child which may be too intense for some young viewers."

Middle-aged a little worn and competent within the limits of a job that doesn�۪t require much critical thinking Sandra agrees to search Becky and her belongings.

Ky. (and roughly 70 similar hoaxes nationwide) this psychological horror movie slithers rapidly from uncomfortable to unspeakable. And inasmuch as this level of sordidness can be handled tastefully Mr. Zobel succeeds in expunging all titillation from Becky�۪s ordeal." the director periodically allows us some relief backing his camera out of the storeroom where Becky is confined to check on her mystified colleagues. Snapshots of greasy fries and slimy grills pump up the unsavory atmosphere while Heather McIntosh�۪s ominous cello-driven score plucks our nerves and stirs our stomachs." Mr. Zobel cares less about charges of exploitation than about making us feel the monstrousness of the behavior on view. (A sequence involving Sandra�۪s bewildered boyfriend brilliantly handled by Bill Camp teeters right on the edge of plausibility.)" her subtle resentment of her attractive prisoner complicating her apparently mindless actions.

At a certain point you grit your teeth close your eyes and pray that the vehicle doesn�۪t run off a cliff. It doesn�۪t quite." the ride has its exhilarating moments. Ms. Leo and Mr. Eisenberg portraying variations of types they�۪ve played before lend their characters considerable complexity. Every move of Ms. Leo�۪s unhinged stubborn Penny is an extravagant overreaction milked for maximum dramatic effect. Ms. Leo has no qualms about making her eccentric character a disagreeable loudmouth. But underneath her iron exterior is a soft heart." self-sacrificing caretaker and problem solver.

�۝ a supernatural thriller with a chilly ���Masterpiece Theater�۝ gloss and a pretentious post-Freudian subtext. Ghosts are not merely the restless undead in this sleek first feature directed by Nick Murphy from a screenplay he wrote with Stephen Volk. They are also repressed memories in the subconscious of its luscious female Sherlock Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall from ���Vicky Cristina Barcelona�۝). More broadly they are the unquiet spirits of the dead in a country paralyzed with grief after the traumas of World War I and the 1918 influenza pandemic." and England is awash in counterfeit spiritualism as a nation of survivors desperately seeks comfort from loved ones in the hereafter. Florence is an outspoken antispiritualist with an academic pedigree who has written a book pooh-poohing the existence of ghosts. In the opening scene she accompanies the police in a raid on an elaborate s̩ance." a stammering war-wounded history teacher at Rockwood a boys�۪ boarding school to work her ghost-busting magic. The place has been gripped with panic since a student was said to have been scared to death by the ghost of a child murdered there years earlier." a grim country fortress that has been vacated for Christmas an unconvincing romance ignites between them." enigmatic matron Maud Hill (Imelda Staunton) who is almost a dead ringer for the pre-Julie Andrews ���Mary Poppins�۝ of the children�۪s book." �۝ observes Maud whose faraway look conveys an ineffable sadness." a radiant little boy who has nowhere to go over the vacation because his parents are in India and Edward Judd (Joseph Mawle) a sinister scowling groundskeeper who carries a shotgun and is suspected of having shirked his military obligation." so that at certain moments watching the movie feels like taking an eye exam. You see it then you don�۪t. But the film is not especially scary and even its boo! moments lack a visceral shock." a billiard ball and a dollhouse radiating with portent." as Florence sets up exquisitely designed devices for detection that include powders to reveal finger- and footprints and trip wires and sensors that seem to have lives of their own. The most beautiful one resembles a silver weather vane that appears guided by unseen forces." ���The Awakening�۝ is pretty stale stuff.

Emma forsook show business after nearly succumbing to the same excesses that caught up with Houston who died in February not long after ���Sparkle�۝ was completed. If the film is a sudsy show-business Cinderella story in which Emma�۪s youngest daughter Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) ascends to glory Houston�۪s presence makes it a cautionary tale." a remake of the 1976 film starring Irene Cara and Lonette McKee with a score by Curtis Mayfield. But Houston dominates the new ���Sparkle�۝ and gives its most compelling vocal performance in her rendition of ���His Eye Is on the Sparrow.�۝ Her vocal stamina was considerably diminished by the time she filmed the movie but her disciplined slightly hoarse rendition of that gospel standard gives ���Sparkle�۝ much of its heart." and she brought to her role a sharper dramatic focus than in her previous screen performances. With her rigid posture and narrowed eyes Emma is a woman who has seen the light with a vengeance. Her unbending strictness is a form of self-flagellation. As Emma talks in clipped accelerated sentences you sense the same fierce defensiveness Houston often put on like armor in interviews during her career. But as hard-nosed as Emma can be she signals that behind the severity is a protective unwavering love." Sister (Carmen Ejogo) Delores (Tika Sumpter) and Sparkle form a Supremes-like trio Sister and Her Sisters Emma is beside herself but there is no stopping them. Even when its sexy shimmying lead singer who suggests a more voluptuous Diana Ross with a self-destructive daredevil streak is banished from Emma�۪s house they keep at it.

But its three sisters are more clearly differentiated." hard-boiled Sister who is approaching 30 is dead set on stardom which she will do anything to achieve. Delores who is bound for medical school is the first of the three to adopt an Afro hairstyle. The shy doe-eyed Sparkle is a secret songwriter and aspiring singer whose ambitions are aggressively discouraged by her mother." as conceived is so innocent that she doesn�۪t seem fully aware of the melodramas swirling around her. But this 2007 winner of ���American Idol �۝ who has slimmed down since her victory has a wonderful voice. And in Sparkle�۪s big final number at a preposterous solo concert debut with a full gospel choir to a packed house after minimal preparation she delivers. That event is about as believable as the hoary myth of instant movie stardom after being discovered sipping a soda at Schwab�۪s drugstore." by far the most developed character is Sister�۪s abusive boyfriend and future husband Satin (Mike Epps) a boozing coke-snorting stand-up comic whose routines are put-downs of black people. As the Black Power movement gathers force audiences are beginning to turn on him and he takes his frustration and fury out on Sister who comes to rehearsals with black eyes and in one scene is beaten with a belt. Satin�۪s dramatic counterweight is Stix (Derek Luke) Sparkle�۪s on-again off-again boyfriend." the cinematography too dark and there are holes in the story. If the new songs on the soundtrack are effective Motown pastiches most of them pale beside their prototypes. But diluted Motown is better than none." violence and drug taking."

�۝ a cold funny number about the erotics of money and the seduction of death is that of a chrome grille on a white stretch limousine. The shot is a close-up that�۪s so tightly framed that the grille with its U shape and vertical bars looks as if it were smiling. It also looks like a shark a perfect starting point for a story about a master of the universe who over one long day and night lives eats evacuates and fornicates in the limo. A master who like some kind of millennial Jonah has taken up residence in the belly of a new beast." a young money man whose mysterious ways with capital have made him so unfathomably rich that he seems to have transcended everyday flop-sweat wheeling and dealing and reached a permanent state of Zen. You first see him next to a building as unmoving and marble white as a Greek statue (or maybe a stiff). He�۪s impeccably dressed in a black suit and white shirt with a meticulously knotted tie a luxuriant slick swirl of hair and fathomless blue eyes initially obscured by dark glasses. The world is his succulent oyster. But all that Eric wants ��� all that this contemporary god who lives in a tower and plays with money needs ��� is a haircut." so it�۪s no surprise that the movie didn�۪t find much love when it played at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The story is as sleek as its limo is symbolically lugubrious. While being driven around New York a zomboid billionaire loses a great deal and by doing so becomes human. It�۪s the end of the world or at least one world in a movie that�۪s opaque and transparent as well as discomfortingly real suggestively allegorical and perversely comic never more so than during a prostate exam that ��� with a snap of latex and the crown of sweat that beads across Eric�۪s perfect alabaster head ��� becomes a sexualized display." like so much else in the movie takes place in the limo. But before Eric gets in to begin his strange journey he diffidently informs his head of security Torval (Kevin Durand) that ���we need a haircut.�۝ In this context the royal we is of course preposterous both too big for such a small desire and terribly puny for the centuries of royal prerogative that Eric evokes when he uses it. The first person plural also suggests that there�۪s an identity crisis lurking behind those dark glasses and that the man who will soon settle into the limo isn�۪t a unified ���I�۝ in the familiar comfortingly coherent Cartesian sense of ���I think therefore I am.�۝" you see is a contingent creation an accretion of habits and conventions a postmodern construction. At first he seems like a manifestation of the artist Barbara Kruger�۪s brilliant 1987 commentary on consumer culture: ���I Shop Therefore I Am.�۝ Eric buys and sells money but because money has changed the self who buys and sells it has transformed too." �۝ says Eric�۪s chief of theory Vija Kinsky (Samantha Morton a mesmerizing droning delivery system) one of the handful of visitors who pop in and out of Eric�۪s limo dispensing bad news and aper̤us. The Greeks had a word for the art of moneymaking (���chrimatistikos�۝) but now she continues ���all wealth has become wealth for its own sake �۝ and money having lost its narrative quality ���is talking to itself.�۝" money appears to have stopped talking to him. This may be why he wants a haircut but only from his father�۪s old barber a yearning that summons up family tradition simplicity and those old lost days when money bought something tangible something you could touch as effortlessly as the bristles of newly shorn hair." but only in the most abstract sense. He doesn�۪t move money but rather gazes at numbers flowing on the glowing blue monitors in his limo. What�۪s missing is the thrill of the hunt the buy and sell the fear and desire. He sprawls on his thronelike perch in the limo having satisfied every whim and while he wants more always more there�۪s a sense that he�۪s bought himself into oblivion." some involving the mysteriously unpredictable yuan forcibly and with escalating violence shake Eric out of his torpor. Nearly affectless at first Mr. Pattinson makes a fine member of the Cronenbergian walking dead with a glacial blank beauty that brings to mind Deborah Kara Unger in the director�۪s version of J. G. Ballard�۪s ���Crash.�۝ Mr. Pattinson can be a surprisingly animated presence (at least he was on ���The Daily Show With Jon Stewart �۝ where he recently put in a game appearance) and he may be capable of greater nuance and depth than is usually asked of him. Certainly with his transfixing mask and dead stare he looks the part he plays here and delivers a physical performance that holds up to a battery of abuses including that prostate exam and some anticlimactic tears." both inside the limo and out. The difficulties of shooting in such a tight space which seems to expand and contract depending on the scene (as if the car were breathing) are conspicuous but rendered invisible by his masterly filmmaking. Mr. Cronenberg keeps you rapt even when the story and actors don�۪t. Some of this disengagement is certainly intentional. Taken as a commentary on the state of the world in the era of late capitalism (for starters) ���Cosmopolis�۝ can seem obvious and almost banal. But these banalities which here are accompanied by glazed eyes are also to the point: the world is burning and all that some of us do is look at the flames with exhausted familiarity." a dark gleaming space in which different monitors are roused to virtual life like luminous underwater creatures. The limo is an extension of Eric: it�۪s car and carapace both but it also provides him with literal windows onto a world that as the day unfolds comes ferociously threateningly alive with anarchist protests a vision of self-annihilation and stirrings of revolution. From inside the limo these images surround Eric like a wraparound movie screen and can look as ersatz as the rear-projection in an old Hollywood film. Each time Eric steps outside though these screens fall away and he�۪s left in a mounting frenzy of life and death one that affirms its reality with brutal finality."

at their best do whatever they want; movies all too often do what they think they are supposed to do. No artist is freer than one with a good story and a sufficient supply of paper and ink and the graphic-novel form as it has evolved over the last two decades ��� to encompass memoir history and eyewitness journalism ��� is bracingly unconstrained by visual or narrative convention. It is not surprising that some of the most interesting films in recent years have tried to capture that freedom." �۝ Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud�۪s brilliant 2007 adaptation of Ms. Satrapi�۪s two-volume autobiographical work certainly fits into that category. And so does their new movie ���Chicken With Plums �۝ based on Ms. Satrapi�۪s book of the same title." ���Chicken With Plums�۝ dwells on an episode in the life of a distant relative. There are glances at events like the Shah�۪s crackdown on leftists after the 1953 coup that overthrew Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh and at the Islamic Revolution of 1979 but for the most part the film dwells in a stylized world of romantic longing and artistic melancholy." �۝ but rather (for the most part) through conventional live-action cinematography. This is not to say that ���Chicken With Plums�۝ is a work of realism. If anything its look is wilder and more fanciful than the sober pen-and-ink panels of Ms. Satrapi�۪s books." luckily is Mathieu Amalric who plays Nasser-Ali a gifted and tormented violinist. At the beginning of the film for reasons that become clear only later after the tangents of his life have been explored he decides to take that life." too violent too vulgar ��� he settles on a suitably poetic course of action or rather of terminal passivity. Nasser-Ali announces that he has surrendered the will to live takes to his bed and like the tragic heroine in a Victorian novel awaits his expiration which comes after eight days and innumerable sighs and cigarettes." played by an owlish Maria de Medeiros); his relations with his children (Mathis Bour and Enna Balland who grow up in dreamy flash-aheads to be Chiara Mastroianni and Christian Friedel); and his love of the violin." which he tries to replace. But as his tale unfolds in its episodic leisurely way it becomes clear that his malaise is rooted in a deeper heartache." while studying music in Shiraz Nasser-Ali courted the beautiful Ir̢ne (Golshifteh Farahani). The possible allegorical significance of her name is happily not insisted upon but her elusiveness and the intensity of Nasser-Ali�۪s passion suggest that she represents an ideal image of the nation betrayed by the grim compromises of history. Though he seems to have been a melancholy guy before they met the loss of Ir̢ne gives Nasser-Ali�۪s subsequent sorrow a special intensity." madly melodramatic musical score (by Olivier Bernet) the film takes an almost giddy pleasure in unhappiness turning even pedestrian moments of boredom or discomfort into occasions for wild invention. The Angel of Death appears (played by Edouard Baer) as do other mythic and half-mythic figures and the filmmakers indulge a vast repertory of cinematic and theatrical effects using Expressionist lighting garish parody and deep rich tones that recall early hand-tinted Technicolor." but not exactly moving: Nasser-Ali�۪s grand passion is posited rather than communicated in spite of Mr. Amalric�۪s exquisitely soulful performance. In the transition from page to screen a dimension of emotion of psychological density seems to have been misplaced so that this richly embroidered tale feels more anecdotal than epic less like a fully imagined film than like a series of beguiling and beautiful pictures." muted violence and endless smoking."

In ���Robot & Frank �۝ an eager-to-please story set in the near future about an elderly gent his robot and some awkwardly managed truths about old age Frank Langella plays so many variations on cute and crotchety and with such suppleness ��� he�۪s by turns a charming codger a silver fox and a wise graybeard ��� that his performance comes close to a saving grace." like one of those eccentrics entombed in a lifetime�۪s worth of empty pickle jars and mildewy copies of National Geographic. He seems alone and adrift but he�۪s actually tethered to his loving children a realist Hunter (James Marsden) and a dreamer Madison (Liv Tyler) who check in with him via a screen looming above his fireplace. Once an ancestral portrait heavy with generational weight might have hung in that spot but this being a gently dystopian tale it�۪s the faces of the descendants who flicker there." including the books he borrows the trifles he swipes and his bewildering changing world although he minds very much when Hunter decides that his messy increasingly forgetful father needs a minder. Ignoring Frank�۪s protests Hunter delivers a gleaming white machine ��� a VGC-60L ��� that stands about five feet tall out of the box and has articulated limbs a head that looks like a motorcycle helmet and a soft insinuating voice which suggests that Peter Sarsgaard prepared for his vocal role by repeatedly listening to HAL 9000 apologize to Dave in ���2001: A Space Odyssey.�۝ (The performer Rachael Ma tucked inside the robot gives it persuasive motion as it toddles along as butler dog and scold.)" one that the first-time feature director Jake Schreier working from Christopher D. Ford�۪s script tries to sell with smiles and soft comedy. That�۪s too bad because Mr. Sarsgaard his silky voice oozing is onto something appropriately creepy and Mr. Langella who can be a ferocious thrillingly powerful screen presence has it in him to take this ingratiating story somewhere dark or at least someplace deeper. Yet while the filmmakers are willing to show Frank�۪s vulnerability as in some early scenes of him wandering perilously alone or just talking with a sympathetic librarian Jennifer (Susan Sarandon) they keep pushing him onto safer ground. They also pile on the complications in what seems like an effort to blunt the sadness." though it tries hard to make you laugh particularly with a belabored subplot involving Frank�۪s former bad habits which he tries to revive with the help of the robot. These hijinks almost derail it but late in the movie there�۪s an anguished scene in which Frank and Jennifer by looking at some photos bridge the past and present. Within moments as she gazes into his face as if searching for the imponderable and he storms off these two actors summon up the transformative unhealed pain of a devastating loss. The exchange is a jolt and it briefly shifts the movie into a more truthful difficult emotional register that acknowledges what it means for someone to fade away. Almost by accident the filmmakers open a vein."

���Beloved�۝ (���Les Bien-Aim̩s�۝) and its predecessor ���Love Songs�۝ (2007) ��� do not burst into song so much as wander into it giving voice to complicated thoughts about their feelings rather than to the feelings themselves. The musical numbers which occur with minimal choreography on ordinary streets (and are written for both movies by Alex Beaupain) are less expressive than analytical as if singing were above all a kind of philosophical reflection." �۝ the singer says to her beloved ���but what kills me is that I can�۪t live without loving you.�۝ The words are sung playfully and thoughtfully in a mood of detachment from the passions that they describe. But the film itself for all its moments of whimsy and humor is laced with tragedy and if it is about love it is also about mortality disappointment and unbearable loss." her daughter and various husbands and lovers ���Beloved�۝ touches on a few historical calamities as well: the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968; the AIDS epidemic; the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Honor̩ hops across decades and geographical boundaries visiting Prague London Montreal and the French cathedral city of Reims but always returning to Paris his inexhaustible source of romantic and cinematic inspiration." which takes place in 1964 might be mistaken for a morsel of a movie made in that year. The skirts and hairstyles of the young women selling shoes in a chic boutique seem less like period details than like a snapshot of a dizzy finger-popping moment of historical transition. One of the salesgirls Madeleine is played by Ludivine Sagnier and if she reminds you of the young Catherine Deneuve ��� who worked in a more provincial shop in Jacques Demy�۪s ���Umbrellas of Cherbourg �۝ speaking of musicals France and 1964 ��� that is hardly an accident. Madeleine will age gracefully into Ms. Deneuve herself and her daughter Vera will grow up into Chiara Mastroianni who is Ms. Deneuve�۪s daughter in real life." and almost as soon as she puts on the shoes she receives a proposition from a man who assumes she is a prostitute. She turns down his offer and then accepts it commencing a guiltless spell of part-time sex work that ends when one of her clients a handsome Czech doctor named Jaromil (Rasha Bukvic) proposes marriage. She says yes (with a bit of ambivalence) gives birth to Vera and moves to Prague. Then things get complicated." the man she cannot live without loving (as the song says) but constancy and fidelity are not part of their relationship. They spend decades apart periodically rekindling their ardor into old age when Jaromil is played by a marvelously sly Milos Forman and Madeleine is married to a solid fellow named Fran̤ois (Michel Delpech)." meanwhile navigates romantic complications of her own though she seems more melancholy and less self-confident in doing so than her briskly impetuous mother. In the Fran̤ois role there is Cl̩ment (Louis Garrel) Vera�۪s colleague confidant and sometime lover whose ardor she can never quite return. The man of her dreams however is one she can�۪t quite have an American musician and former veterinarian named Henderson (Paul Schneider) who tells her on the first night of their acquaintance that he�۪s gay." and sexual identity is like monogamy a mostly theoretical matter. Suffering however is quite real and Ms. Mastrioanni in particular gives voice to the pain and confusion that form the melodramatic underside of sexual comedy." alive to the absurdity and perversity of amorous behavior and also to the gravity and intensity of human emotions. A nonmusical version (which is what Mr. Honor̩ has said he originally conceived) would resemble other recent French films that take a psychologically realistic view of love that is neither cynical nor sentimental. But the songs even when ��� or maybe just because ��� they sound conventional and superficial gesture toward another realm of feeling a magical pop universe in which the agonies of the heart are magically transformed into pleasures of the ear and eye."

That night during a violent storm a dirt-covered leaf-sprouting creature claws its way out of the soil and into Jim and Cindy�۪s house." but ���The Odd Life of Timothy Green �۝ written and directed by Peter Hedges (���Pieces of April�۝; ���Dan in Real Life�۝) does not belong in that category. Or at least not intentionally. The ghastliness of this damp and squishy comedy is the byproduct of a confused and earnest sentimentality a willful devotion to wide-eyed wonder that confuses simplicity with simple-mindedness." forthright disposition. He is said at one point to be 10 though how this could be determined without cutting him in half and counting his rings is unclear." he is apparently not a perennial so his season with the Greens will be short and end in tears. We know this from the start since the story is framed by an adoption agency interview in which Jim and Cindy speak of Timothy ��� as their sentient mobile photosynthesizing ward comes to be known ��� in the past tense." though it would be going too far to say they accept him. They are in any case a parade of grotesques drawn equally from children�۪s book archetypes and media-fed caricatures of the American middle class. There are Cindy�۪s hypercompetitive helicopter-mom sister (Rosemarie DeWitt); Jim�۪s demanding emotionally distant father (David Morse); and also outside the family circle a gruff soccer coach (Common) and a pair of mean bosses. Jim�۪s employer (Ron Livingston) runs the town pencil factory while his sour aunt (Dianne Wiest) is in charge of the pencil museum where Cindy works as a guide." and the bullies at school who smear food all over Timothy are horrible. The only exception is Joni (Odeya Rush) a moody solitary girl who falls in love with him." for all their diffident fumbling sweetness are kind of horrible too. Mr. Edgerton a tough and subtle actor is reduced to mumbling and looking at his feet as if waiting for the camera to go somewhere else while Ms. Garner mugs and emotes enough for both of them and the rest of the cast too." but this is what is known as humblebragging: they are congratulating themselves on being sensitive modest nonprogrammatic parents and less obnoxious than the people around them." though they are bumbling hysterical narcissists barely competent to manage ordinary human interactions with their temporary son. Who is of course not really human but rather more than human in a glowing otherworldly endlessly sympathetic way. His job is to teach all the others how to be better versions of themselves and then to exit the scene on a flood of pious comforting tears.

Except me I guess." wish-created companion the others being ���Ted �۝ in which a child�۪s toy becomes a foul-mouthed best buddy and ���Ruby Sparks �۝ in which a writer�۪s imagination conjures the perfect girlfriend." but three is a trend and these movies clearly represent a disturbing crisis in human relationships.

on television and at the movies the streets were full of complicated cops: big-city detectives whose confusion frustration and unorthodox methods reflected a general crisis of authority in the societies they served. Popeye Doyle Dirty Harry Callahan and Frank Serpico (at least as imagined by Al Pacino and Sidney Lumet) made common existential cause with small-screen counterparts like Kojak and Columbo. Max the sad obsessive Parisian flic at the heart of Claude Sautet�۪s ���Max et les Ferrailleurs �۝ is an especially memorable addition to this international brotherhood of disaffected policemen even if his contributions have until now been largely forgotten." ���Max et les Ferrailleurs�۝ is receiving a belated and welcome American opening at the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center the capstone of a Claude Sautet retrospective. Sautet a director and screenwriter who died in 2000 is probably best known in this country for ���Un Coeur en Hiver �۝ his 1992 psychological drama starring Emmanuelle B̩art and Daniel Auteuil." a tough and subtle dramatist with a gift for teasing moral complications out of straightforward genre scenarios." grainy color in grubby workaday locations in and around Paris ���Max et les Ferrailleurs �۝ adapted from a novel by Claude N̩ron has the matter-of-fact look and careful pace of a precinct-house procedural. The film�۪s central crime is the robbery of a bank branch by a gang of small-timers and most of the cops are beleaguered cynical bureaucrats." he stands out as a somber and aloof figure among his colleagues. His wide-brimmed black hat is closer to what a sheriff in a western might wear than to the standard fedora of the urban lawman and family money frees him from the necessity of filing expense reports for the bachelor pad he rents or the prostitute he pretends to employ as he pursues his big case." but rather signs of Max�۪s perverse and terrifying zeal. He believes almost as a philosophical conviction that the only real way to solve a crime is to catch the perpetrator in the act. The problem of course is that criminal behavior like the rest of human life is rarely predictable enough to ensure that outcome. Max�۪s solution is to manufacture the crime he will solve indirectly but methodically manipulating an old army buddy into planning a bank job." Abel (Bernard Fresson) lives in Nanterre an unlovely suburb where he and some pals ��� the ���ferrailleurs �۝ or junkmen of the title ��� eke out a livelihood stealing scrap metal and chopping cars. Their lack of ambition is the opposite of Max�۪s professional monomania and some of the film�۪s suspense arises from doubt about whether they will prove too lazy and disorganized to attempt the armed robbery that Max intends to foil." a German streetwalker who lives with Abel and who has slightly loftier aspirations than he does. Max pretending to be a lonely divorced banker becomes her most loyal and lucrative customer even though they never have sex. Instead they drink wine play cards and lounge around Max�۪s apartment until their artificial intimacy starts to resemble the real thing." but under Sautet�۪s measured merciless gaze it starts to look like a more profound betrayal of the basic idea of justice. More disturbing is that Max�۪s colleagues and superiors seem to be aware of the plan and untroubled by its implications." single-minded determination is undermined only by Mr. Piccoli�۪s soft brown eyes which communicate unspoken and enigmatic hurts. This remarkable actor who was the cuckolded screenwriter in Jean-Luc Godard�۪s ���Contempt�۝ and who has lately brought a melancholy twinkle to movies like Manoel de Oliveira�۪s ���I�۪m Going Home�۝ and Nanni Moretti�۪s ���We Have a Pope �۝ is one of the treasures of European cinema." for a sadly shorter time was Romy Schneider. (She died in 1982 at 43.) Her resilient grace keeps ���Max et les Ferrailleurs�۝ tantalizingly poised among comedy realism and a tragic love story. In the �۪70s Schneider was a fixture in Sautet�۪s films and the overdue arrival of ���Max et les Ferrailleurs�۝ gives American audiences a chance to rediscover both of them."

Mr. Ferrell does his rabid frat-boy thing; Mr. Galifianakis does his deranged baby-man thing; and there may be comfort in the thought that the American people would never elect clowns like these to any office. But then a glance at some of the clowns we do elect perhaps especially to our national legislature might lead you in the opposite direction. Really the movie could not possibly go far enough unless the screenwriters (Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell) had abandoned all invention and transcribed the script directly from C-Span." played with brandy-swilling cigar-wielding relish by John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd.

They are happy to buy politicians from either party as long as their mercenary interests are protected. And while it is possible to interpret ���The Campaign�۝ as a brief for campaign finance reform the script is also careful to note late in the game that Citizens United is the law of the land." which is sometimes very funny in the usual zany pop-surrealist sketch-comedy manner is studiously inoffensive and thoroughly chicken-hearted.

But we have seen and will see much worse before the votes are counted in November.

the franchise�۪s new face played by Jeremy Renner comes out of the Alaskan wilderness to take refuge in a cabin. There he meets another of his kind a superspy with a scowl and enough artillery to invade a small country. By the time they�۪ve grudgingly warmed up to each other an unmanned drone is blasting everything to bits. It�۪s an effectively blunt opener for a series that from its start has tracked a different military drone this one a man fighting to recover first his identity and then his humanity. That you may not remember the name of Mr. Renner�۪s agent Aaron Cross after all the dust finally settles suggests that the fight goes on." ���The Bourne Legacy�۝ is the fourth installment in a series that until now starred Matt Damon as the eponymous spy who with his near-uncanny wiles smarts and strength ran circles around American intelligence agencies and box office rivals both. Superior industrial entertainments the three previous titles ��� the first was directed by Doug Liman the second and third by Paul Greengrass ��� injected new energy and savvy into American action cinema which like many of its aging stars had been suffering from blockbuster bloat. The Bourne movies put identifiable human stakes into the action equation along with a sense of palpable moral outrage politics and under Mr. Greengrass�۪s kinetic watch increased torque." then was an American hero who didn�۪t wreak random destruction who didn�۪t simply light the fuse with a wisecrack and walk away but dug deep into the mystery of why there was a chip in his body and blood on his hands. (Plus: supercool stunts.) Both Mr. Greengrass and Mr. Damon were slated to make another ���Bourne �۝ but when that project fell apart Tony Gilroy a writer on all three earlier movies was tapped to take the lead on the franchise. Mr. Gilroy has only two other directing credits including ���Michael Clayton �۝ a low-key low-action thriller in which the biggest bangs were from an exploding car and Tilda Swinton�۪s savage performance as a lawyer." �۝ written with his brother Dan has given him much more to wrangle ��� locations characters hardware franchise expectations ��� than he�۪s had to deal with in the past. If that worried him it doesn�۪t show in the movie�۪s hyperventilated opening stretch which zips from Cross battling wolves doubts and military drones in Alaska; to Scott Glenn and Stacy Keach as a couple of military men who go alpha male to alpha male about a covert operation and its consequences in a darkened room in the D.C. power corridor; to Edward Norton as Colonel Byer barking someplace else at flunkies who not being your average hired help can pull up high-definition surveillance images from across the globe with a few phone calls and strokes on a keyboard." this one called Outcome which has produced enhanced operatives ��� like Cross ��� as ingenious and lethally skilled as Bourne. Gradually and somewhat murkily Mr. Gilroy lays out how Cross ended up wrestling with wolves in Alaska only to play a more savage game of cat and mouse with Colonel Byer. The sympathetic Mr. Renner handles the action scenes persuasively but Mr. Gilroy never turns the fight sequences as both Mr. Liman and Mr. Greengrass did into occasions for a surprisingly resonant sense of regret and even sorrow. Cross has his own qualms as flashbacks reveal but none of Jason Bourne�۪s deeply felt agonies or his strong sense of purpose." jumping into scenes without much explanation beyond a nod to the location it can feel especially early on as if he�۪s trying too hard to match the accelerated tempo of Mr. Greengrass�۪s movies. However frenetically paced each of the three Bourne movies sprang more or less coherently from the one before it. And because Mr. Greengrass was building on the same story with the same hero and other familiar faces his feverish crosscutting and globe-trotting never got in the way of narrative coherence. By contrast while Mr. Gilroy retains some of the Bourne bequest he�۪s also created a tricky parallel universe with a new agency that has its own clenched-jawed closed-door complications and a hero who nearly becomes lost among them." for instance folding characters from the earlier movies into this one. He even stitches a bit that looks as if it�۪s from ���The Bourne Ultimatum �۝ with a shot of Colonel Byer on the phone a juxtaposition that suggests that he�۪s been casting shadows over Bourne World for a while. Yet Mr. Gilroy perhaps impatient to establish his own Bourne legacy doesn�۪t work off the franchise�۪s foundation for long instead veering off to juggle his many new faces and places. By the time Rachel Weisz as a scientist called Dr. Marta Shearing showed up in a lab coat I stopped trying to parse every plot twist and just went with the action flow." as in a tense unnerving shootout in a house even if Mr. Gilroy can be disappointingly cavalier when it comes to racking up bodies. Little feels at stake here other than his future as a Bourne director. One of the pleasures of this series is how well its ever more kinetic visual style has served its stories. With its frenzied fragmentation of time and space the filmmaking has conveyed a sense of urgency that mirrored Bourne�۪s shattered being and his propulsive convulsive journey from unenlightened self-interest to accountability from the existential question mark of his identity to a hard moral reckoning. Through all three movies Jason Bourne was still trying to find the answers. Now with Bourne gone Mr. Gilroy needs to find other questions worth asking."

This celebration of African-American resilience in a struggling New York neighborhood envisions two cultures coexisting uneasily in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. It is on the side of hope." the loyal parishioners at the Lil�۪ Peace of Heaven Baptist Church whose indomitable preacher Da Good Bishop Enoch Rouse (rousingly played by Clarke Peters of ���The Wire�۝) inveighs against 21st-century ills in his thunderous sermons. The other side is a tight little knot of homeboys rappers and drug dealers living in the same housing project as Enoch." trash-and-graffiti-littered battleground but a reasonably well-maintained complex in which the two groups mostly keep their distance. No gunfire rings out and although a visitor is warned against straying into gang-controlled territory the atmosphere is relatively peaceful." Bedford-Stuyvesant which he portrayed as an ethnic tinderbox in his 1989 film ���Do the Right Thing.�۝ Linking the two movies is the reappearance in ���Red Hook Summer�۝ of Mookie (Mr. Lee) the pizza deliverer from the earlier film still making his rounds all these years later." Silas Royale a k a Flik who has been dispatched to Brooklyn for the summer by his mother Colleen (De�۪Adre Aziza) for reasons that are never explained. A prep school student from a comfortable middle-class background Flik (Jules Brown) is a self-professed nonbeliever and vegan who complains about his small room and Enoch�۪s cooking. The symbol of his alienation is his iPad which he clutches like a shield." Flik makes a friend in Chazz (Toni Lysaith) a mouthy girl his own age whose mother Sister Sharon Morningstar (Heather Alicia Simms) is a devoted member of Enoch�۪s flock. The depiction of the friendship between these lonely discontented children going through puberty is a sharp reminder of what it feels like to be at that scary in-between age." Enoch is its heart and soul. For all his inspirational rhetoric he is an exasperating blowhard who loves the sound of his own voice. Whether in the pulpit or strolling through the project�۪s walkways he never stops preaching and dropping the name Jesus." whom it portrays as rocks of fortitude in a decaying community and on Deacon Zee (Thomas Jefferson Byrd) the Lil�۪ Piece of Heaven�۪s tippling caretaker." �۝ like most of Mr. Lee�۪s films has a prominent musical soundtrack that underscores the editorial tone of the screenplay written by Mr. Lee with James McBride.

Enoch often sounds like a mouthpiece for Mr. Lee. Drugs rap AIDS reality television celebrity culture the gap between rich and poor disappointment in Barack Obama ��� the list of subjects is long. The more Enoch sermonizes the clearer it becomes that faith is his only bulwark against chaos and nothingness." one of Enoch�۪s services is interrupted by the dramatic equivalent of a gunshot to the head as Enoch�۪s past catches up with him. At this point ���Red Hook Summer�۝ turns into another movie: a feverish tabloid dream crammed with symbolic images that include recurrent shots of the Statue of Liberty and violence that evokes the persecution of Jesus. It all feels furiously dashed off as if Mr. Lee who financed the film himself had run out of money and time." it still registers like a flashing sign that cannot be ignored." a scene of violence and adult themes."

Frustrated by his poker face and his noncommittal responses and stressed out by everything else going on in her life (about which more shortly) Marion launches into an unhinged obscene tirade at the poor man. Later in the film a karmically empowered pigeon drops an airborne excretory insult on him. Since Marion is played by the director of the film Julie Delpy I will take this as a warning." �۝ is what the critic says and this is more or less how I feel about ���2 Days in New York �۝ a sequel of sorts to Ms. Delpy�۪s ���2 Days in Paris.�۝ There is great charm and considerable insight in her ideas about romance cultural misunderstanding and daily life in a modern metropolis. And there are also moments of marvelous comic exuberance and lovely caught-on-the-fly glimpses of Manhattan without its makeup. But the film which is about a chaotic 48 hours in Marion�۪s life succumbs to the chaos it depicts and so undermines its best intentions. It is all in all a likable mess." released in 2007 she traveled to Paris with her American boyfriend Jack (Adam Goldberg) who was hit with a barrage of her nutty kinfolk and former lovers. Now she and Jack have split up after having a son together (a sweet-faced toddler named Lulu) and Marion lives with Mingus (Chris Rock) a journalist and radio host who has a child from a previous marriage." open kitchen ��� is disrupted by the arrival of three of the noisettes from ���2 Days in Paris�۝: Marion�۪s father Jeannot (played by Ms. Delpy�۪s father Albert); her sister Rose (Alexia Landeau); and Rose�۪s boyfriend Manu (Alex Nahon) a fool whose precise variety of foolishness is probably only expressible in French. They proceed to drive Mingus and Marion crazy so much so that cracks begin to show in the couple�۪s relationship." partly because Ms. Delpy and her cast depart from the usual caricatures of Frenchness while still engaging in broad silly satire. Jeannot an irrepressible Gallic garden gnome of a man is briefly detained at the airport for trying to enter the United States with enormous quantities of cheese and sausage some of it taped to his body. Rose once settled in her sister�۪s apartment walks around in various states of undress while Manu who arrives wearing a T-shirt that says ���Obama Homeboy �۝ expresses views on race that are either disarmingly progressive completely offensive or somehow both at once. (This is something of a French specialty. See ���The Intouchables�۝ for a further example.) He and Rose also smoke weed in the elevator and have noisy sex in Marion and Mingus�۪s bathroom possibly involving Mingus�۪s electric toothbrush." sloppy fun. But Ms. Delpy is aiming for more than just culture-clash absurdity. She tries to weave in some tougher more complicated feelings including Marion�۪s grief over the recent death of her mother. This calamity ��� which would have affected Jeannot and Rose as well ��� is occasionally mentioned but never really incorporated into the emotional structure of the film." comfortable couple. Ms. Delpy�۪s dithering intensity is as winning and nerve-racking as her jaunty Gypsy-jazz score. But Mr. Rock is an unsteady foil. Though he has improved as an actor (and looks good with a grown-out goatee) he is still not quite able to convey warmth. Mingus is quick to take offense at his houseguests�۪ behavior and to berate Marion for burdening him with them but his absence of tenderness or compassion ��� of any recognition that the visit might be hard on her too ��� is troubling and confusing perhaps more for the audience than for Marion. Mr. Rock�۪s best moments are monologues confessional stand-up routines delivered to a life-size cardboard cutout of President Obama." unsentimental eye on the city which looks lived-in real and nonmythical the way that Paris often looks in French movies and New York rarely does in Hollywood confections.

A production of Moriah Films a division of the Simon Wiesenthal Center ���It Is No Dream�۝ satisfies neither as a movie nor as a history lesson." the film sticks closely and unimaginatively (the usual still photos and bits of early film footage) to Herzl�۪s biography. We learn how this assimilated Viennese playwright and journalist ��� he covered the Dreyfus trial in Paris ��� became radicalized convinced that Jews were not safe in Europe. If Herzl looks prescient in hindsight many contemporaries thought he was crazy. (His behavior sometimes fit the bill.) Nonetheless he obsessively pursued his solution to the ���Jewish question�۝ ��� a state." the movie can seem remarkably obtuse. There�۪s talk of Palestine but not of Palestinians. What did Herzl think about the people who lived there only a fraction of them Jews? We hear only and almost in passing that he thought Arabs would benefit from a Jewish state." Shimon Peres (���The country is changing every day for the better�۝) ���It Is No Dream�۝ barely touches on the hot-button issues of Zionism with all its contradictions tragedies and ironies.

The story is narrated by a 15-year-old named Ellis Whitman (Graham Phillips) a latter-day Holden Caulfield without the quirks and the pathos who lives with his nightmarish mother Wendy (Vera Farmiga) on the outskirts of Tucson." a k a Javier (David Duchovny) a pot-smoking misfit with flowing hair and a ZZ Top beard who stays rent free on the property with his pet goats in exchange for caretaking chores. Occasionally Goat Man goes on quasi-mystical treks through the mountains with his animals Lance and Frieda. More lost soul than ascetic hippie saint Mr. Duchovny�۪s Goat Man is a sort-of father (as well as a pot supplier) to Ellis. He conveys the same rancid hipness that infects Hank Moody Mr. Duchovny�۪s disagreeable character in ���Californication�۝ on Showtime." Bennet (Justin Kirk) a supercilious gigolo who treats Goat Man with disdain. But Goat Man gains the upper hand after he observes this hustler receiving oral sex from a man on the edge of Wendy�۪s pool." self-pitying Wendy who is filled with rage at her ex-husband Frank (Ty Burrell). She is beside herself when Ellis chooses to attend the same East Coast prep school as his stern remote father who lives in Washington with his new wife. Although the bitter competition between the exes over where their son will spend Thanksgiving is nasty Ellis expertly navigates the emotional minefield." Barney (Nicholas Lobue)." making his directorial debut strings together scenes with no regard for structure; the movie just wanders from incident to incident. There is no dramatic or comic center to this coming-of-age story whose characters eventually connect with one another a little better than they did at the beginning. Nor is there much doubt that Ellis a well-grounded ���A�۝ student is in little serious danger." ���Goats�۝ could have been so much more than an episodic sequence of whimsical little psychodramas."

�۝ in 1913 with reflections that occurred at the edge of sleep. Almost 20 years earlier Joseph Conrad had kicked off his first novel ���Almayer�۪s Folly �۝ with a rude awakening from a daydream. Both writers have inspired the Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman to make free adaptations: ���La Captive �۝ her sensual mesmerizing 2000 film (based on Proust�۪s ���Prisonni̬re�۝) and now ���Almayer�۪s Folly�۝ (���La Folie Almayer�۝) a tropical study in helpless intransigence from Conrad�۪s often overlooked debut." his daughter with a local woman who has gone mad is sent away for Western-style schooling in the city only to find rejection instead of assimilation. The business prospects that are Almayer�۪s initial reasons for remaining upstream end up faring little better especially as his partner or benefactor fades away." who is supposed to be helping Almayer with his pipe dreams. But the elliptical involuted ���Almayer�۪s Folly�۝ is less about this melodramatic plotting of forbidden love than about being trapped in a state of mind." who gripes incessantly and has a habit of dramatically crying out ��� usually too late ��� is stuck and he remains stuck. It�۪s not even possible to marvel at his gloom and alienation as a stranger abroad as you might in response to Conrad�۪s more famous work ���Heart of Darkness.�۝ There�۪s something immovable within him and it keeps him from fully engaging with his daughter�۪s need for freedom." or ruminating about being on the other side of a border has long been a key part of Ms. Akerman�۪s films. She often seems to be feeling out the muscle memory of exile in her camera movements and framing but here the stasis of Almayer�۪s existence is intensely felt. Shooting the film in Cambodia Ms. Akerman may well be going farther afield than in her hybrid nonfiction work in the past two decades (spanning the Eastern bloc Mexico and Israel). Yet for all the leafy exteriors and chugging boats Almayer is very much inside even when he�۪s out." Ms. Akerman casts as Almayer the same French actor Stanislas Merhar who starred in ���La Captive�۝ (and who remains little known here beyond that role). Lank and pale Mr. Merhar is not the sweaty grizzled type you might expect after years in expat purgatory; he looks at once well preserved and sickly like a beach house shut-in. The vibrant beauty of Nina (the new face Aurora Marion) seems almost an affront though she carries her own morbid streak." however is frustratingly stiff and perhaps never more compelling than in the anomalous opening: a bravura flash-forward in which Da��n (Zac Andrianasolo) is killed on a club stage and Nina a dancer responds moments later with liturgical song. The film as a whole though shot by R̩mon Fromont Ms. Akerman�۪s skilled collaborator on challenging productions does not have the same consistently entrancing rhythms that help make her work so wondrous." once a heartache spreads like tendrils throughout the film. This effect of his exile is as intense as the excitement despair reflection or disconnect in Ms. Akerman�۪s previous personally felt studies of travelers abroad from ���Les Rendez-Vous d�۪Anna�۝ and ���News From Home�۝ to ���D�۪Est�۝ and ���L��-bas.�۝ ���Almayer�۪s Folly�۝ is not friendly terrain to traverse; like some sinister version of Proust it is a prolonged fever dream that ultimately yields madness."

and in a story about a longtime marriage that�۪s gone dry. It�۪s a subject that�۪s as unusual in mainstream American cinema as the sight of major stars letting it all hang out on camera wrinkles and possibly dignity included though perhaps not for long given the movie industry�۪s growing interest in the country�۪s aging population." but the industry will have to do better if it wants to persuade boomers that there�۪s something for them at the local multiplex other than cartoons and clich̩s. As directed by David Frankel from a promising screenplay by Vanessa Taylor the movie is an awkward cross between a domestic comedy and a marital tragedy that�۪s laced with laughs soggy with tears and burdened by a booming blunt soundtrack that amplifies every narrative beat from ���I Don�۪t Want to Be Your Mother�۝ to ���Everybody Plays the Fool �۝ ���Let�۪s Stay Together�۝ and ���It Ain�۪t Over �۪Til It�۪s Over.�۝" whose direction in ���The Devil Wears Prada�۝ at least had energy seems uneasy handling the mood swings in ���Hope Springs.�۝ When the story takes off Kay and Arnold (Ms. Streep and Mr. Jones) are celebrating their 31st wedding anniversary at home in Omaha over dinner with their grown children a son Brad (Ben Rappaport) and a daughter Molly (Marin Ireland). From the outside both Kay and Arnold�۪s home life and their jobs seem perfectly normal if bordering on monotonous. Arnold�۪s name hangs outside his office at the accounting agency where he works and exchanges bathroom small talk with his colleague and apparently only friend Vince (Brett Rice); Kay folds tops at the clothing shop where she makes small talk with her colleague and apparently only friend Eileen (Jean Smart)." though it�۪s clear that Kay and Arnold are living separate lives. Every night he falls asleep in his lounger while watching a golf show on TV and they head off to separate bedrooms and every morning she greets him with bacon eggs and a smile he doesn�۪t return. To underline the point Mr. Frankel stages the breakfast scene enough times that he must have made his way through several dozen fried eggs. It�۪s obvious but made lightly funny because of Mr. Jones�۪s sleepy shuffle and also a bit painful because Ms. Streep lets you see the disappointment in Kay�۪s face when Arnold makes for the table and his newspaper. Something has to give and does." playing it straight) a therapist Kay discovers through a self-help book and who takes the story into places that Mr. Frankel doesn�۪t always seem comfortable going. With Dr. Feld�۪s gentle insistent encouragement Kay and Arnold turn the couch into a veritable stage on which they enact a familiar marital drama characterized by swapped accusations confessed disappointments and exchanged hopes in long scenes that are engaging if largely on a voyeuristic level and so cinematically inert that you may find yourself counting the creases on Ms. Streep�۪s and Mr. Jones�۪s faces during the many close-ups. The creases are beautiful and there�۪s certainly pleasure in watching them undulate across such malleable movable masks." despite Mr. Frankel�۪s stolid direction as he cuts between Dr. Feld murmuring thoughtful Oprah-eseque banalities from his chair and Kay and Arnold plopped side by side and sometimes squirming and mugging on the couch. Mr. Frankel has a tougher time once Kay and Arnold who travel to Maine to work with Dr. Feld retreat into their separate corners. Mr. Frankel can keep a scene alive when the performers are chattering or on the move but once silence descends he seems at a loss. There�۪s something about the quiet that sends him into a panic and as he cranks up the tunes and throws in some Maine color it�۪s almost as if he realized that his packaged uplift was a bad fit for that elusive American movie screen subject: an honest marriage."

�۝ a 2011 documentary portrait of identical twin prostitutes she calls out a cheery hello to the man behind the counter. She has a purple hat and orange scarf framing her plump white face and a Chihuahua tucked under an arm and what she needs she announces is a box of condoms. She was 69 when the movie was shot and still plying her trade from one of the picture windows in Amsterdam�۪s red-light district. Two years earlier her sister Louise had hung up her own riding crop because as the second twin explains in this insistently upbeat movie ���I couldn�۪t get one leg over the other.�۝" as is this 70-minute movie which like Martine sells the goods with a come-hither smile. The sisters toddle around often arm in arm and in gaudily colorful matching outfits greeting friends strangers and presumably clients. Initially from their chatter and laughter and the repetitive upbeat score that�۪s heavy on the cimbalom and grind organ the Fokkenses don�۪t appear to have a care in the world. There�۪s more to their story of course as turning tricks at 69 suggests. And while the directors Gabrielle Provaas and Rob Schroder take a peek beyond the facade they�۪re reluctant to linger there for long." Ms. Provaas and Mr. Schroder tag after the Fokkenses wordlessly following the sisters around town and into their separate flats and the small space where Martine services her clients. You see a few of those men whose faces if not their genitals remain somewhat or wholly obscured. One of Martine�۪s specialties appears to be role-playing mixed with light bondage and domination which she advertises with a pair of leather boots that she hangs in the window. The boots are for ���naughty�۝ (one of the sisters�۪ favorite words) men and at one point she puts on some leather and lipstick and gets briskly to work. If any of these guys has a granny fetish no one is saying." day-to-day reality of Martine�۪s job ��� which here is as blurred as the issues involving prostitution in Amsterdam ��� can be frustrating as is the fact that the twins are almost impossible to distinguish from each other. (The filmmakers initially identify them by name with on-screen text but soon drop these helpful tags.) After a while though you stop trying. That�۪s because ���Meet the Fokkens�۝ holds your interest mostly because the sisters (who turned 70 in May) are good company no matter who they are. They�۪re funny and kooky if also sad with puffy faces and frequent glasses of wine parked in front of them. It�۪s no wonder that it often feels as if you were eavesdropping with limited success on a couple of old-timers sharing war stories at the local bar." through conversations and archival material ��� you can trace the passage of time through the rise and fall of teased and straightened hair in the sisters�۪ photographs ��� a bigger picture does come into focus. It�۪s short on detail. Talking to each other and sometimes to the camera (you never hear the questions) Louise and Martine sketch in a familiar story of poverty male violence lost children and a fight for independence. Why the sisters felt that prostitution was their best alternative remains unclear either because they aren�۪t interested in revealing that part of themselves or the filmmakers didn�۪t know how to get them to talk. Or maybe Ms. Provaas and Mr. Schroder weren�۪t interested for political or personal reasons in making what despite the laughter they ended up with: another sad story about whores."

Dick story ��� Earth has been devastated by chemical warfare leaving only two populated areas connected by a tunnel through the planet�۪s core. On one end of the chute known as the Fall is a sleek successor to Britain an imperial metropole that exploits the teeming watery Colony (Australia with elements of futuristic Hong Kong and Bangkok) down below." but the ambitions of the filmmakers ��� Len Wiseman directed a script by Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback ��� lie in the direction of maximum noise and minimum sense. The movie has a lot of chasing shouting and fighting carried out in crowded overscale frames without much regard for either action-film effectiveness or narrative coherence. So much information is thrown at you in such a haphazard fashion that your ability to care dwindles along with your willingness to enjoy any of it." a Colony-dwelling proletarian who commutes via the Fall to his factory job is haunted by strange dreams and is played by Colin Farrell. His wife is played by Kate Beckinsale (who is married to Mr. Wiseman) and now may be the time to note that in the earlier ���Total Recall�۝ the Quaids were Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone. Life is not fair: Mr. Farrell is one of the hardest-working would-be movie stars in the game whereas Mr. Schwarzenegger is among the laziest action heroes in history. But after more than 20 years I retain a vivid memory of Mr. Schwarzenegger saying ���Consider that a divorce �۝ after putting a bullet in Ms. Stone�۪s head. After less than 24 hours I can�۪t recall anything Mr. Farrell said or did other than run from Ms. Beckinsale sometimes in the company of Jessica Biel." as if starring in one of the best shows on television obliged him to take supporting roles in some of the worst movies in theaters. And he doesn�۪t really do much except sneer sadistically and look plausible with hair. Mr. Nighy does even less." �۝ directed by Paul Verhoeven at the apex of his Hollywood credibility (after ���RoboCop�۝ and before ���Showgirls�۝) is not a great movie but it has a garish perverse energy and a willingness to be at once gleefully silly and slyly philosophical that stands up pretty well. It also has Sharon Stone." as neuroscience technology corporate power and political authority conspire to bring some of his paranoid visions closer to reality. But this ���Total Recall�۝ has less to do with Dick than its predecessor did and it might have fared better without the baggage of expectation and comparison that it inevitably carries. A science-fiction movie about a guy on the run and the two slender combative black-suited women who may or may not love him might not be all that memorable but it would at least be forgettable on its own terms." brief nudity and swearing though more of that is likely to come from Philip K.

Despite the scope of the title this friendly colorful documentary from Pip Chodorov is not the last word on all the shapes sizes and languages of experimental film but rather an introduction brightened by a companionable enthusiasm and an apposite sense of community." experimental cinema is open to anyone with the urge to make stuff and the willingness to put aside artistic assumptions and profit. You don�۪t need a story or even people as the pioneering Hans Richter demonstrated with the shifting rectangular abstractions of his 1921 animation ���Rhythmus 21.�۝ Mr. Chodorov�۪s documentary takes its name from Len Lye�۪s ���Free Radicals�۝ (1958) which depicts white lines boogieing and swaying to Bagirmi tribal music. It was created through scratches made directly on film presaging work by Stan Brakhage." in clips from the early 1970s; Robert Breer who died last year; Brakhage eloquent soon before his death in 2003; Jonas Mekas the Anthology Film Archives artistic director and creative ambassador; and the inimitable Ken Jacobs who self-mockingly recalls his youthful ambition to ���capsize�۝ the United States." and grabs a beer with Mr. Mekas with whom he helped spearhead Anthology in the late �۪60s. Stan Vanderbeek�۪s forays into computer-generated film at Bell Labs and M.I.T. in the �۪60s and �۪70s show the avant-garde as technologically ahead of its time." but Mr. Chodorov�۪s focus could use greater historical coverage and a richer variety of visual examples. The East Coast wins out a little too handily over Los Angeles and San Francisco let alone contemporary scenes elsewhere. Graphical coups tend to push out psychological found-footage and other adventures in perception and the short shrift given to certain voices is puzzling and arbitrary."

Further investigation led Ms. Morley to Alistair a former tour manager for the soul singer Betty Wright who became Ms. Vincent�۪s live-in boyfriend in a two-year relationship that was fraught with conflict." most of the film�۪s interviewees are not introduced and it is left for the viewer to figure out who they are and to try to piece together a timeline.

Set in Los Angeles it begins as a mildly self-consciously quirky story about a young married couple played by an appealingly matched Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg who have split up without moving on or out. Best friends Celeste and Jesse share the same adolescent humor fondness for stupid voices and even property lines: a hard-driving trend forecaster she lives in their house while he�۪s a laid-back artist who now flops in the backyard studio. You see what keeps them together even when it shouldn�۪t." stuffed with clich̩s and grinning idiots unintentionally work your last nerves; at least initially ���Celeste and Jesse�۝ seems rigged to shred them. Written by Ms. Jones and Will McCormack and directed by Lee Toland Krieger it takes off with an increasingly discomfortingly cutesy scene of Jesse and Celeste chortling over a dirty joke involving a squirting tube of lip salve. The scene is more awkward than funny but that�۪s the point because there�۪s something hermetic maybe stunted about Celeste and Jesse�۪s intimacy. Once home they head in opposite directions. The next time you see them they�۪re side by side once more and having dinner with friends one of whom Beth (Ari Graynor) announces that she can�۪t take it anymore and splits." Tucker (Eric Christian Olsen); she�۪s running out on Celeste and Jesse. The problem isn�۪t that they�۪ve split up and made life unbearable for friends worried about choosing sides: it�۪s that in many crucial ways they�۪re together. Jesse may be roughing it in his studio but he and Celeste live much as they always have sharing the same old habits and jokes until a plot twist snuffs out the laughs and they have to figure out something new. There�۪s no script for what they�۪re doing other than the one Ms. Jones and Mr. McCormack wrote. That�۪s why while ���Celeste and Jesse�۝ is decidedly conventional in most respects it�۪s pretty swell as an exploration of a relationship between a man and a woman that�۪s no longer predicated by mutual desire." with a believable lived-in sense of Los Angeles that largely steers clear of the usual regional clich̩s for more recent ones including the Prius that Celeste drives and the pot dealer (a funny Mr. McCormack) who gripes about how the city�۪s legal medical marijuana dispensaries are cutting into his business. Mr. Krieger shooting in digital leans too heavily on the hand-held cinematography when trying to create an air of agitated familiarity. But he�۪s very good with the actors. He pulls warm performances from his leads without sacrificing Celeste�۪s hard edges and gives the supporting players enough space to fill their characters with personality including Emma Roberts as a petulant pop star and Elijah Wood as a somewhat butcher Eve Arden." screwball comedy was where men and women redefined gender relations in between zingers and slapstick. In some screwball romances a man and a woman battle their way into marriage; in others it�۪s an estranged couple who fight their way back into love. As gender relations evolved the romantic comedy rarely rose to the great screwball occasion dragged down by antediluvian stereotypes and formulas. Equality between the sexes or so it seems turned out to be a joke killer one reason bromances exist: if you can�۪t imagine women as equals just sidestep them." Man�۝ Ms. Jones made the best of a supporting role as a woman whose fianc̩ after deciding that he needs dudes to pal around with goes on a series of man dates. A friendship with one man follows and reaches its apotheosis when they declare their love for each other while Ms. Jones�۪s bride waits at the altar. It�۪s easy to imagine that Ms. Jones a regular on ���Parks and Recreation �۝ grew tired of waiting. With ���Celeste and Jesse Forever �۝ she and Mr. McCormack have righted the sex imbalance of the bromance with a story about two people who together and alone express an ideal rarely seen in American movies: a man and woman whose equality is burnished in friendship not just in bed and marriage."

Here the world isn�۪t just small it�۪s also a 360-degree metaphor that begins with a woman�۪s breasts leads to the boulevard circling Vienna�۪s center and ends with the ���O�۝ of your slack-jawed incredulity." it�۪s because you�۪ve seen iterations of it in movies like ���Babel�۝ (in which a gun connects strangers) and ���Crash�۝ (in which unnatural Los Angeles disasters do). In ���360�۝ the topless Cassandra a Slovak named Mirka (Lucia Siposova) poses for a Viennese pimp Rocco (Johannes Krisch) who arranges a liaison between her and a British businessman Michael (Jude Law). Back home in London Michael has a wife Rose (Rachel Weisz) who has a lover a Brazilian photographer Rui (Juliano Cazarr̩) who�۪s involved with Laura (Maria Flor). Laura wises up and ends up on a plane where en route to Miami and Rio de Janeiro she meets a fatherly gent John (a sympathetic Anthony Hopkins) who�۪s on his way to Phoenix to identify a body." an unlikely layover for a plane trip that begins in London and ends in Rio. That�۪s distracting but less so than her decision at the airport to pick up a shifty-eyed American Tyler (Ben Foster) who as rotten luck and screenwriter determinism would have it is a sex offender. (Cringingly Tyler enters the story soon after a scene of Michael and Rose with their young daughter.) In the movie�۪s cause-and-effect logic Laura faces danger in Denver because a Slovakian whipped off her bra because the Soviet Union fell apart ... and in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." his wife her lover and so on ��� the screenwriter Peter Morgan was clearly attempting to bend the Austrian playwright Arthur Schnitzler�۪s late 19th-century play ���La Ronde�۝ into a gloss on globalization. In Schnitzler�۪s influential roundelay a character in a sexual twosome turns up in the next scene with someone else a pattern that keeps repeating to create a daisy chain of desire. But in ���360 �۝ somewhere between Vienna and Paris and the multilanguage songs and gentle guitar strumming that bridge too many sequences Mr. Morgan and the director Fernando Meirelles break away from this sexual patterning and begin jumping among the characters with less and less evident narrative rhyme and reason." notably ���The Queen �۝ and Mr. Meirelles has won fans for neo-exploitation titles like ���City of God.�۝ There�۪s no way to know what went wrong with ���360�۝ and whether it was this uninvolving and shallow from the start. It can be tricky to bring viewers into movies that follow multiple characters who may not know one another yet are somehow connected though filmmakers do manage it at best by going deep and not just wide. There are moments in ���360�۝ that show what the movie might have been as in a scene of John at a recovery group that reminds you of what Mr. Hopkins can do. But the overshooting and overediting here suggest Mr. Meirelles or maybe the producers were trying to work around this story instead of with it."

�۝ a hugely appealing documentary about fans faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. One mystery involves its title subject a Detroit singer-songwriter known as Rodriguez who after being discovered in a dive bar cut a well-regarded record in 1969. The album ���Cold Fact �۝ earned good reviews and four Billboard stars but it bombed in the United States and Rodriguez faded from view. Where he went and why are just a few of the questions that a Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul sought in answering the riddle of Rodriguez." fittingly begins his worldwide search on screen in South Africa and with an irrepressible music fan named Stephen Segerman nicknamed Sugar after the Rodriguez song ���Sugar Man.�۝ It was Mr. Segerman who introduced Mr. Bendjelloul to the implausible story of how Rodriguez after copies of ���Cold Fact�۝ hit South Africa in the early �۪70s became an anti-establishment inspiration there and something of a political cause. Rodriguez with his soft guitar strumming and lyrics that hit hard blunt notes (���I�۪ve tasted hate street�۪s hanging tree�۝) became a star. His curtain of dark hair ubiquitous sunglasses and inscrutable smile as well as the fact that no one in South Africa knew much about him only burnished his appeal." partly because of efforts by Rodriguez admirers like Mr. Segerman. In his notes for a 1996 South African CD of Rodriguez�۪s album ���Coming From Reality �۝ Mr. Segerman asked if there were any ���musicologist-detectives out there�۝ who could help answer what had become of the musician. A journalist Craig Bartholomew-Strydom read that line and picking up the challenge like a gauntlet was soon sifting the facts from decades of speculation including the rumor that Rodriguez had died onstage after setting himself on fire." baptized the Great Rodriguez Hunt. What they eventually discovered is often delightful and at times so poignant that many of the most crucial details are best left for viewers to discover for themselves. It�۪s almost impossible to see a movie these days without knowing too many of its surprises and ���Searching for Sugar Man�۝ is one of those that�۪s best seen with as little knowledge of its subject as possible. Mr. Bendjelloul knows that too. That�۪s why after he introduces Mr. Segerman Mr. Bendjelloul returns to the past to spin the story chronologically beginning with Dennis Coffey and Mike Theodore who produced ���Cold Fact.�۝" archival imagery and some dreamy animated sequences Mr. Bendjelloul builds a narrative that simultaneously moves in two seemingly opposite if complementary directions. Interview by interview location by location he tries to go into the mystery of a single man even as he heads out into a world that initially rejected Rodriguez and then embraced him. Each interview adds another piece to the puzzle. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Theodore describe what it was like the first time they saw Rodriguez who was playing with his back to the audience; Mr. Segerman and others explain what this music meant if you were a young white South African and grasping for hope in the somber at times despairing songs of a Detroit musician." a dark-skinned Mexican-American who sounds like (for starters) Bob Dylan James Taylor and Nick Drake was embraced so passionately by white South Africans under Apartheid. Rather he accepts the declarations of love and fan explanations that it was the right music for a country in lockdown. That scarcely seems like the whole story especially for such a complex country and while occasionally the movie teeters close to embracing bromides about the universal healing power of pop culture there�۪s too much sincerity in ���Searching for Sugar Man �۝ too much love and enduring human mystery for cynicism to take hold. In the end Mr. Bendjelloul went looking for a man and found something much greater."

Alison Klayman as a favor to a friend started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling. In May 2008 right after the catastrophic earthquake in the Sichuan Province Mr. Ai had begun posting photographs of the disaster on his blog. A few months later he began distancing himself from the National Stadium known as the Bird�۪s Nest which had been built in Beijing for the 2008 Summer Olympics and for which he had been a creative consultant. He called the China Olympics effort a ���pretend smile�۝ and criticized its heavy security. On Aug. 25 in The Guardian he wrote that China�۪s quest for gold medals wasn�۪t important." �۝ Mr. Ai wrote are ���the tens of thousands of lives ruined because of poor construction of schools in Sichuan because of blood sellers in Henan because of industrial accidents in Guangdong and because of the death penalty. These are the figures that really tell the tale of our era.�۝" ���Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry.�۝ In 2008 two years out of college and living in China Ms. Klayman had been invited to make a short movie pegged to a show of 10 000 photographs Mr. Ai took while living in New York between 1983 and 1993. (A big man physically and otherwise who lives and works in a big big country Mr. Ai likes to make big art.) Working for the most part by herself she began tagging after Mr. Ai interviewing him at his home-studio compound on the outskirts of Beijing with the amusing street address ���258 Fake�۝ and then following him into streets galleries restaurants and police stations." and Ms. Klayman perhaps inspired by her monumentally minded subject ended up with hundreds of hours of material. Some of those visuals were used for a 20-minute piece ���Who�۪s Afraid of Ai Weiwei �۝ that she made for the PBS show ���Frontline�۝ and which was broadcast in March 2011. Narrated by Ms. Klayman it ends after the government destroyed Mr. Ai�۪s new studio in Shanghai and her asking him why he�۪s so fearless. ���I�۪m so fearful �۝ he counters squinting at the camera. At the same time he continues ���If you don�۪t act the dangers become stronger.�۝ That same exchange and other moments from the short movie are also in ���Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry �۝ which expands and without a voice-over improves on her earlier work mostly because it contains more background interviews and recent events including his fight against accusations of tax evasion." who had argued that tax authorities were wrong when they raided his home studio last year and swept him away for three highly publicized months. Ms. Klayman�۪s documentary doesn�۪t include this latest development of course but it�۪s nonetheless extraordinarily up to date. The fluidity and convenience of digital moviemaking tools explain some of its freshness as does Ms. Klayman�۪s history as a budding documentarian. It�۪s clear from watching both the feature and its earlier iterations that while she was learning about Mr. Ai she was also learning how to tell a visual story. It�۪s easy to think that hanging around Mr. Ai a brilliant Conceptual artist and an equally great mass-media interpolater played a part in her education." creates and fights the movie is stuffed with smart talking heads archival material (look for him as a street portraitist in New York) and fly-on-the-wall scenes of Mr. Ai talking eating and sending out endless Twitter messages. If it seems as if there were fewer scenes of him making art it�۪s only because it�۪s no longer possible to see the divide between it and his life. His actions and words explain why that�۪s the case. So does his art as Ms. Klayman reveals including by going behind the scenes of a 2010 exhibition at the Tate Modern in London called ���Sunflower Seeds.�۝ For that installation Mr. Ai and an army of assistants arranged 100 million handmade porcelain sunflower seeds on an enormous gallery floor." hinged on an axis of sameness and difference was stark beautiful haunting."

These are people the filmmakers suggest who by their deep-fried stupidity and avarice deserve to fade quickly." it turns out.

Joe and discovers that he�۪s signed on with the devil. Here as in other movies that use violence to jolt up the dreary proceedings Chris and his problem turn out to be the warm-up act for Killer Joe. And Mr. McConaughey�۪s magnetic murderer is definitely the main attraction. He dominates his every scene with a hushed voice that carries a threat and a tensed restrained physicality that suggests a rattler before it strikes. He�۪s a queasily compelling nut job reminiscent of the one in Jim Thompson�۪s pulp classic ���The Killer Inside Me �۝ and because Joe has the best lines a mysterious back story and is played by a real star the movie needs his juice badly." and so too are the actors wrangling the roles. Of these Mr. Church buoyed by his comic deadpan and inherently funny slurry whiny intonation comes off the best. Mr. Hirsch puts energy or at least twitching into his performance but the character is such a one-dimensional contrivance a means to a dramaturgical end that it�۪s hard to see any actor making it work. Both Ms. Temple and Ms. Gershon bring out the worst in Mr. Friedkin as a director. He lingers over their naked bodies for no narrative reason (however dubious her role Ms. Temple doesn�۪t look like a little lost girl) and takes such a creepily intimate approach to Sharla�۪s and Dottie�۪s violent degradation that you might think he enjoys it." a director with a talent for kinetic screen violence never finds his groove with ���Killer Joe �۝ which lurches from realism to corn-pone absurdism and exploitation-cinema surrealism. Such lurching isn�۪t necessarily bad and could have proved entertaining. Yet as with his embarrassing ogling of Ms. Juno/Dottie and the relish with which he stages a scene of Sharla being viciously beaten it feels as if Mr. Friedkin is consistently controlled by the story�۪s excesses rather than in control of them. Mr. Letts�۪s play is usually called a black comedy (you wouldn�۪t know it from his screenplay) and that clarifies why it�۪s a bad fit for the ever-serious Mr. Friedkin whose idea of funny here is immolating a corpse under a restaurant sign reading ���Billy�۪s Mo�۪ BBQ.�۝" �۝ a funny/unfunny 2007 freak show in which Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon play kooks who descend into madness.

That may be why Mr. Friedkin cranks the volume at every opportunity as a diversionary tactic for a story featuring a family of white-trash clich̩s and the murderer cum preacher who�۪s there to bring the peace." including a brutal scene of sexual violation; it also has a sex scene with a clothed man and a naked much younger woman."

Making no pretense of giving Dole a voice (in fact a spooky voice recording and a shadowy image are pretty much all we get of this multinational company) he instead questions media alignment behind the food giant. Pointed comments from journalists spin experts and Mr. Gertten�۪s stoic colleagues lighten the mood but there�۪s no doubt that this director has ended this battle significantly more chastened and exhausted than when he began."

the absorbing documentary ���Abendland�۝ opens with a self-reflexive image of a surveillance camera perched over a green field. The Austrian director Nikolaus Geyrhalter holds the shot long enough for you to appreciate that it�۪s meant to resonate but it�۪s uncertain what makes either this image or the green field significant. What you may reasonably wonder are you to glean from a banal 21st-century image like that of a surveillance camera particularly when Mr. Geyrhalter doesn�۪t offer any obvious explanation?" hard familiar or frustrating effort of course and Mr. Geyrhalter sometimes likes to give his viewers a bit of a workout. That initially seems true of his 2005 movie ���Our Daily Bread �۝ a nonfiction look at industrial food production. It doesn�۪t have a narrator or talking-head experts but a distinct point of view emerges from the images of the often heavily mechanized production of foodstuffs ��� from baby chicks to olives ��� and from the relentlessness of Mr. Geyrhalter�۪s gaze. With ���Our Daily Bread�۝ he wants to show you make you really see what remains comfortably out of sight in such production including cruelty to animals. The movie�۪s title taken from the Lord�۪s Prayer adds another layer of commentary." some of whom are watching other people through cameras and monitors. That opening shot of the surveillance camera for instance is followed by one of an unidentified man looking at what appears to be the same green field on a monitor. He points out a rabbit and a car; mentions the border. What follows are more night scenes including one in which more unidentified people take calls at a Dutch suicide prevention center; another in which Spanish guards patrol a fence; and a sequence in a Bavarian playground where hundreds maybe thousands of revelers sing eat rotisserie chicken and drain beer steins." as an artful amalgam of perfectly framed seemingly disconnected moments during a long shared night give or take a time zone change or two. It is a vision that recalls Benedict Anderson�۪s influential 1983 book ���Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism �۝ in which he defines a nation as ���an imagined political community ��� and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign.�۝ Mr. Anderson argues that nations are socially constructed (���imagined�۝) because while most of their members never meet face to face they can imagine one another in communion as when they read the same newspaper. (It�۪s an old book!) It is this sense of fraternity that leads people to die on behalf of their countries." �۝ Mr. Geyrhalter has created a portrait of an ���imagined community�۝ that�۪s readily recognizable as Europe (if devoid of swarming tourists). It�۪s easy at least to guess what he has in mind by combining shots of surveillance cameras and border fences (which suggest keeping outsiders out) with culturally specific blowouts like Oktoberfest: that the different nationalisms often seen to have defined and nearly destroyed Europe ��� and are here evoked by images of singing Bavarians in lederhosen ��� have been supplanted by a Europe that is itself an imagined community. ���The people here enjoy safety and prosperity �۝ Mr. Geyrhalter says in a statement on the movie�۪s Web site. ���What enables this privileged life is exclusivity restricting enjoyment of the benefits and limiting participation for the simple reason that the available resources wouldn�۪t be sufficient otherwise.�۝" fury laughter ��� was lost in translation. As he has before in ���Abendland�۝ he shows you images that aren�۪t always readily visible like those of the heavily fortified fences in the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa. What to make of such fences is up to you as is whether the movie�۪s title is diagnostic or predictive. It is worth noting that ���Abendland�۝ means ���evening land�۝ and is sometimes used to mean ���the West �۝ as in the German historian Oswald Spengler�۪s famed study of Western culture ���The Decline of the West.�۝"

�۝ ���Oh wouldn�۪t it be loverly?�۝" �۝ an ingenious and delightful variation on the Pygmalion myth toys whimsically with these questions as the initially perfect relationship between a neurotic author and his sprung-to-life fictional creation goes through changes." Calvin Weir-Fields (Paul Dano) a shy self-absorbed Los Angeles writer is a literary whiz kid. His first novel which he wrote at 19 was a best seller; a decade later its reputation ranks just below that of ���The Catcher in the Rye.�۝ Calvin�۪s problem is how to follow it up." he meets his Galatea Ruby Sparks (Zoe Kazan) during a walk in the park with his dog Scotty (named after F. Scott Fitzgerald). This smart saucy redhead first glimpsed as a hazy silhouette emerging out of the sunlight in a brief opening dream sequence is a figment of his imagination. But once literary inspiration seizes him she takes shape as he invents her character on his typewriter." who by now has a back story downstairs making breakfast. She�۪s a 26-year-old painter from Dayton Ohio who has moved around the country a lot. Her idols are Humphrey Bogart and John Lennon." and he tries fruitlessly to wish her out of existence. It gets weirder when his worried brother Harry (Chris Messina) finally meets Ruby and confirms that she is not a hallucination. Harry suggests that Calvin test out the theory that she is a product of his imagination by fleshing out her character with more quirks and determining whether she changes under his dictation." �۝ directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris the team behind ���Little Miss Sunshine �۝ has the same zany and sweet tone laced with just enough hardheaded wisdom to keep it grounded in psychological truth. The screenplay by Ms. Kazan is so polished and witty that it immediately puts her in the same league as Diablo Cody. And Ms. Kazan�۪s lovely tart performance is the equal of Ellen Page�۪s portrayal of the title character in ���Juno.�۝ Both are impetuous screwball heroines who could have been created only by women." misogynist jokes about sexual organs bodily fluids and performance anxiety and the poor woman would be subjected to humiliating trials." which treats Ruby and Calvin (the lead actors are a real-life couple) with equal respect refuses to go there. What a relief to see a funny romantic comedy whose humor stays above the waist." with his combination of sheepish nerdiness and intellectual arrogance suggests a softer-edged better-looking Woody Allen character. The first time he realizes the degree of his control over Ruby is when he writes that she speaks fluent French. Moments later that is all she speaks." Gertrude (a twinkling Annette Bening) persuades him to bring Ruby to her house in Big Sur. Gertrude and her partner Mort (an amusing but miscast Antonio Banderas) who designs avant-garde furniture are superannuated hippies so radiant that they make Jane Fonda�۪s bohemian grandma in ���Peace Love & Misunderstanding�۝ seem dour." Ruby responds with alarming intensity. One moment she is clinging and dependent and the next she is maniacally buoyant. When Calvin decides to grant Ruby some independence and his lecherous editorial mentor (Steve Coogan) puts the moves on her at a literary party he can�۪t handle it." frantically typing instructions which she tries to resist but can�۪t. The more conflicted their relationship the further the movie ventures into Charlie Kaufman-Michel Gondry territory without twisting itself into intellectual knots." beautifully written and acted romantic comedy that glides down to earth in a gently satisfying soft landing." some strong language and drug use."

(Young-chan is a poet and essayist.) No other family members are mentioned." their declarations don�۪t seem morbid so much as practical. Such speculation along with Young-chan�۪s confessions of loneliness prevents the movie from becoming the kind of reassuringly cozy love story of disabled people who find each other and live happily after ever." but the film is evasive about identifying his faith.

in which the rich take it as their sovereign right and civic duty to get richer while the rest of us look on in envy simmer with resentment or dream of rebellion. ���The Queen of Versailles �۝ a new documentary by Lauren Greenfield about life on the thin fragile sugarcoated top layer of the upper crust captures the tone of the times with a clear surprisingly compassionate eye." the movie starts out in the mode of reality television resembling the pilot for a new ���Real Housewives�۝ franchise or a reboot of ���Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.�۝ Before long though it takes on the coloration of a Theodore Dreiser novel ��� not quite an American tragedy but a sprawling richly detailed study of ambition desire and the wild swings of fortune that are included in the price of the capitalist ticket." in 2007 David and Jackie Siegel are living an outsized unlimited version of the American dream. His time-share business Westgate Resorts is booming. Families seduced by easy credit aggressive sales tactics and the chance for a taste of luxury are eager to sign on the dotted line and a sleek new Westgate dream palace has just gone up in Las Vegas." his hard work and his devotion to causes including the Miss America organization and the Republican Party. His wife a former model and beauty contestant is outgoing and unpretentious so tickled by her extravagant life that it is hard not to share her enthusiasm." 000-square-foot mansion in Orlando Fla. the Siegels are building a palatial home more than three times as big.

If you detect a spoiler here it�۪s hardly my fault: blame the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent collapse of the real estate market events that ���The Queen of Versailles�۝ recaptures from an especially intimate and fascinating perspective." who traipse through the movie along with a staff of maids and nannies and an indeterminate number of fluffy white dogs. The household is a busy place its rhythms determined by Mr. Siegel�۪s work ethic and Mrs. Siegel�۪s passionate consumerism. They are frank and open with Ms. Greenfield�۪s crew and generous with their time allowing a remarkable degree of scrutiny even as the gilding begins to peel away." but in America to paraphrase William Blake litigation is true friendship.)" and ���The Queen of Versailles�۝ does have its moments of real-life comedy. ���How was it flying commercial?�۝ Mrs. Siegel asks one of her children as they arrive in her western New York hometown for a visit. Descending on the car rental counter she asks ���What�۪s the name of my driver?�۝" and their relations with the people around them seem relatively untouched by snobbery or noblesse oblige. It is hard not to enjoy Mrs. Siegel�۪s company or to be unmoved by aspects of her life story." and a fair amount of evidence that Mr. Siegel is not always such a nice guy. One of his sons from an earlier marriage now a partner in Westgate says some things that hint at a cold narcissistic paternal core. But the children of farmers doctors and factory workers have also been known to find fault with their distant driven demanding fathers." �۝ F.

�۝ a once-upon-a-time French film about love family and the seductive beauty of the Proven̤al countryside when the story�۪s sweetness nearly makes your teeth ache. A remake of a 1940 film by Marcel Pagnol it turns on a humble young woman Patricia (Astrid Berg̬s-Frisbey) who�۪s literally swept off her feet and across a stream by a grocer�۪s son Jacques (Nicolas Duvauchelle). By the time he puts her down their lives have inexorably changed and she seems on her way to becoming one of fiction�۪s female martyrs an innocent sacrificed on the altar of social hypocrisy and an authorial need to lecture on such hypocrisy." �۝ a pastoral wrapped in gauze sunlight and sentimentality. Patricia though wanly played by the pretty Ms. Berg̬s-Frisbey turns out to have more spunk than initially evident. That�۪s good for her and also for the film because she�۪s soon belly deep in the kind of melodramatic complication that can drag a woman and a story down. Her adoring father Pascal Amoretti (Daniel Auteuil who also directed) has a pal Felipe (Kad Merad) who�۪s smitten with her. Felipe asks Pascal permission to woo her and Pascal being the old-fashioned patriarch he is and this being the kind of self-conscious nostalgia piece it is consents believing he has the right to encourage this farce." comic awkward Felipe is so egregiously wrong for Patricia (he looks at least 20 years older than she does) that it�۪s more painful than funny to watch his pursuit especially because she has her demure eye on Jacques. The grocer�۪s son has money and while there�۪s something suspiciously louche about how he smokes a cigarette ��� it hangs in his mouth carelessly as if he couldn�۪t be bothered with it or anything else in life ��� he also has a motorcycle and flies planes. From the way Patricia leans into Jacques when he gives her a lift on his motorcycle it�۪s obvious that she�۪s hurtling down one road while Felipe stumbles down another. Their journeys will bring surprises to each character if fewer to you." oblivious earthy and believable as a wooden centime meanwhile tends to his other five daughters. Mr. Auteuil an often wonderful actor ��� his credits include Andr̩ T̩chin̩�۪s ���Thieves�۝ and Michael Haneke�۪s ���Cach̩�۝ ��� is fun to watch here even at his most unpersuasive. Amid many shots of the countryside and intimate family scenes Pascal rolls his eyes puffs out his cheeks and raises his voice threatening to give someone a beat-down that never comes. The character screams salt of the earth yet the performance doesn�۪t feel gleaned from reality but rather from some calculatingly packaged and peddled notion of authenticity. The performances from Sabine Az̩ma and Jean-Pierre Darroussin as Jacques�۪s parents are similarly amusing broad and irritating." a preliberation version with a voice cameo from the Vichy leader Philippe P̩tain and a postliberation version with one from Charles de Gaulle.) Although Pagnol was more beloved by audiences than critics ��� his films include ���The Baker�۪s Wife�۝ and ���Manon des Sources�۝ ��� he is now recognized as a forerunner of Italian neorealism. No less than Roberto Rossellini apparently agreed and he told Pagnol: ���The father of neorealism in the cinema isn�۪t me it�۪s you.�۝" who loved some Pagnol if not ���The Well-Digger�۪s Daughter �۝ wrote that what Americans admire in the movie is ���the freedom of the mise-en-sc̬ne in French film.�۝ Adding ���In the extreme it is France itself they admire.�۝"

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/movies/hara-kiri-death-of-a-samurai-from-takashi-miike.html
especially since the director is Takashi Miike a wildly prolific Japanese filmmaker best known for sanguinary delights like ���Audition�۝ and ���13 Assassins.�۝ But  ���Hara-Kiri�۝ finds this busy genre omnivore in a quiet even classical frame of mind. More moving than shocking it proceeds slowly and gracefully and the few scenes of bloodshed are emotionally intense rather than showily sensational." the film written by Kikumi Yamagishi and based on a story by Yasuhiko Takiguchi evokes an august Japanese cinematic tradition. It seems to pay particular tribute to Masaki Kobayashi a director whose somber samurai epics include ���Samurai Rebellion�۝ (1967) and an earlier ���Harakiri�۝ from 1962. Mr. Miike�۪s movie is not precisely a remake but it explores a similar premise." cast adrift after the dissolution of the noble house he served arrives at the estate of a feudal lord requesting permission to commit ritual suicide in the courtyard. The warriors of the estate suspect a ���suicide bluff �۝ an attempt to use the codes of honor and sacrifice to solicit employment or charity and they treat Hanshiro to a cautionary tale (told in flashback) about a young man who had recently made a similar request. The visitor who was armed with only a bamboo sword was forced to use it to disembowel himself." this young man Motome (Eita) appears callow and foolish. But as we learn about his relationship with Hanshiro a sadder more delicate picture emerges. He was a gentle scholarly soul unsuited for the brutal world that eventually destroyed him. The long lovely middle section of ���Hara-Kiri�۝ is a melancholy drama involving the two men and Hanshiro�۪s beloved daughter Miho (Hikari Mitsushima) Motome�۪s childhood friend and later his wife." and as a portrait of good people in desperate circumstances ���Hara-Kiri�۝ is remarkably sensitive and moving. In one scene Motome is rushing home with a few eggs that he has purchased after selling off some of his books. Jostled by a group of children rushing past he drops one and then stoops to lick the yolk from the ground. This simple depiction of the way poverty can undermine dignity is heartbreaking." rather like an element of Mr. Miike�۪s faithful genre pastiche rather than an expression of authentic feeling. But his fidelity to an older filmmaking style brings out the beauty of the story and his restraint makes ���Hara-Kiri�۝ a credible critique of violence rather than an exploitation of its horror." the film does make an important ��� and in my view misguided ��� concession to the new namely its embrace of 3-D. While the format (which can be avoided if you watch the movie on demand rather than in a theater) sometimes creates an intriguing illusion of depth in Mr. Miike�۪s meticulously composed interior scenes it is more often jarringly disruptive. And the tinting of the glasses darkens images that are already shadowy and dim turning colors drab and faces indistinct. The clarity of the tale and the subtlety of the acting deserve better."

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/movies/the-dark-knight-rises-with-christian-bale.html
the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. As the title promises day breaks in ���The Dark Knight Rises �۝ the grave and satisfying finish to Mr. Nolan�۪s operatic bat-trilogy. His timing couldn�۪t be better. As the country enters its latest electoral brawl off screen Batman (Christian Bale) hurtles into a parallel battle that booms with puppet-master anarchy anti-government rhetoric and soundtrack drums of doom entering the fray as another lone avenger and emerging as a defender of well what?" justice and the American way? No ��� and not only because that doctrine belongs to Superman who was bequeathed that weighty motto on the radio in August 1942 eight months after the United States entered World War II and three years after Batman Bob Kane�۪s comic creation hit. Times change; superheroes and villains too. The enemy is now elusive and the home front as divided as the face of Harvey Dent a vanquished Batman foe. The politics of partisanship rule and grass-roots movements have sprung up on the right and the left to occupy streets and legislative seats. It can look ugly but as they like to say ��� and as Dent says in ���The Dark Knight �۝ the second part of the trilogy ��� the night is darkest before the dawn." an activist district attorney turned murderous lunatic looms over this one the literal and metaphysical personification of good intentions gone disastrously wrong. (He looms even more in Imax which is the way to see the film.) Eight years later in story time Batman having taken the fall for Dent�۪s death and mourning the woman both men loved has retreated into the shadows. Dent has been enshrined as a martyr held up as an immaculate defender of law-and-order absolutism. Gotham City is quiet and so too is life at Wayne Manor where its master hobbles about with a cane while a prowler makes off with family jewels (the intensely serious Mr. Nolan isn�۪t wholly humorless) and Gotham sneers about the playboy who�۪s mutated into a Howard Hughes recluse." of course: the billionaire orphan a k a Bruce Wayne who for assorted reasons ��� like witnessing the murder of his parents when he was a child ��� fights crime disguised as a big bat. Bruce�۪s initial metamorphosis in ���Batman Begins �۝ exacts a high price: by the end of the second film along with losing the girl and being branded a vigilante Bruce-Batman rides virtually alone save for Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the Wayne family butler Alfred (Michael Caine) a fussy uncle with a remarkable skill set. It�۪s central to where Mr. Nolan wants to take ���The Dark Knight Rises�۝ that Batman will be picking up new acquaintances including a beat cop John Blake (a charming Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard)." in this case between large spectacle and humanizing intimacies: one an outlandishly choreographed blowout that introduces a heavy Bane (Tom Hardy); the other a quieter cat-and-bat duet between Bruce and a burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). After checking in with his personal armorer Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) Bruce-Batman swoops into an intrigue that circles back to the first film and brings the series to a politically resonant conclusion that fans and op-ed bloviators will argue over long after this one leaves theaters. Once again like his two-faced opponents and the country he�۪s come to represent Batman begins feared as a vigilante revered as a hero." Mr. Nolan�۪s Bruce-Batman has oscillated between seemingly opposite poles even as he�۪s always come out a superhero. He is savior and destroyer human and beast the ultimate radical individualist and people�۪s protector. Yet as the series evolved this binary opposition ��� echoed by Dent�۪s rived face ��� has grown progressively messier less discrete." seemingly blunt story of good versus evil. It�۪s an old familiar tale that Mr. Nolan in between juggling the cool bat toys demure kisses hard punches and loud bangs has layered with open and barely veiled references to terrorism the surveillance state and vengeance as a moral imperative." working from a script he wrote with his brother Jonathan further muddies the good-and-evil divide with Bane. A swaggering overmuscled brute with a scar running down his back like a zipper and headgear that obscures his face and turns his cultivated voice into a strangulated wheeze Bane comes at Batman and Gotham hard. Fortified by armed true believers Bane first beats Batman in a punishingly visceral intimate fist-to-foot fight and then commandeers the city with a massive assault that leaves it crippled and ��� because of the explosions the dust the panic and the sweeping aerial shots of a very real-looking New York City ��� invokes the Sept 11 attacks. It�۪s unsettling enough that some may find it tough going." maybe especially in a comic-book movie. The specter of Sept. 11 and its aftermath haunt American movies often through their absence though also obliquely as in action films that adopt torture as an ineluctable necessity. Mr. Nolan for his part has been engaging Sept. 11 in his blockbuster behemoths specifically in a vision of Batman who stands between right and wrong principles and their perversions because he himself incarnates both extremes." the state and whether change is best effected from inside the system or outside it. Gordon believes in its structures; Bane wants to burn it all down. And Batman? Well he needs to work it out." explicitly given the grim unsettling vision of a lawless city in which the structures of civil society have fallen structures that Batman has fought outside of. In a formally bravura disturbingly visceral sequence that clarifies the stakes Bane stands before a prison and in a film with several references to the brutal excesses of the French Revolution ��� including the suitably titled ���A Tale of Two Cities�۝ ��� delivers an apocalyptic speech worthy of Robespierre. Invoking myths of opportunism Bane promises the Gotham citizenry that courts will be convened spoils enjoyed. ���Do as you please �۝ he says as Mr. Nolan cuts to a well-heeled city stretch where women in furs and men in silk robes are attacked in what looks like a paroxysm of revolutionary bloodlust." it�۪s due to Mr. Nolan�۪s kinetic filmmaking in a scene that pulses with realism and to the primal fear that the people could at any moment as in the French Revolution become the mob that drags the rest of us into chaos. Yet little is what it first seems in ���The Dark Knight Rises �۝ whether masked men or raging rhetoric. Mr. Nolan isn�۪t overtly siding with or taking aim at any group (the wily Bane only talks a good people�۪s revolution) but as he has done before he is suggesting a third way. Like Steven Soderbergh in ���Contagion �۝ a science-fiction freak-out in which the heroes are government workers Mr. Nolan doesn�۪t advocate burning down the world but fixing it." it may be a relief to know wants to entertain you. He does for the most part effortlessly in a Dark Knight saga that is at once lighter and darker than its antecedents. It�۪s also believable and preposterous effective as a closing chapter and somewhat of a letdown if only because Mr. Nolan who continues to refine his cinematic technique hasn�۪t surmounted ���The Dark Knight�۝ or coaxed forth another performance as mesmerizingly vital as Heath Ledger�۪s Joker in that film." perversely uglified Mr. Hardy unencumbered by Bane�۪s facial appliance might have been able to dominate this one the way Mr. Ledger did the last but that sort of monstrous bigger-than-life turn would have been antithetical to this movie�۪s gestalt. The accomplished Mr. Bale continues to keep Batman at a remove with a tight performance that jibes with Mr. Nolan�۪s head-over-heart filmmaking." Mr. Nolan ends by taking him somewhere new. That�۪s precisely the point of a late sequence in which he shifts between a multitude of characters and as many locations without losing you his narrative thread or momentum. His playfulness with the scenes-within-scenes in his last movie ���Inception �۝ has paid off here. The action interludes are more visually coherent than in his previous Batman films and as in ���Inception �۝ the controlled fragmentation works on a pleasurable purely cinematic level." as Gotham rages and all seems lost the action shifts from a lone figure to a group and hope springs not from one but many."

�۝ it seems an appropriate word to describe the Canadian director Robert Lepage�۪s recent staging of Wagner�۪s ���Ring�۝ cycle at the Metropolitan Opera. Like it or not it was an astounding feat of engineering." four-opera masterwork about the creation and destruction of the world a work that Wagner considered unstageable in his time." ���Wagner�۪s Dream �۝ argues that stagecraft unimaginable in the 19th century has made what seemed impossible possible. The film�۪s few snatches of the final productions first staged during the Met�۪s 2010-11 season have a majestic flow that matches a score roiling with fire and thunder. The film focuses primarily on the creation of a 90 000-pound set nicknamed ���the machine.�۝ In its stately design the production at times suggests the stage equivalent of Stanley Kubrick�۪s ���2001: A Space Odyssey.�۝" which he cites as the primary source for the ���Ring.�۝ His production was based on the theory of plate tectonics in which pieces of the earth�۪s crust are continually shifting. In his view the lava coming out of the ice is the equivalent of the gods expressing themselves." as the device creaks and grinds to a halt you wonder how it could possibly operate smoothly. You also worry about the ability of the performers to vocalize comfortably amid so many hazards. In one scene they rush to avoid being crushed by the lowering platform." one of the first being the stage itself which had to be reinforced to bear the weight of the set. Deborah Voigt the great dramatic soprano who plays Br�_nnhilde a role she was born to sing compares the challenge she faces to ���climbing Everest.�۝ That means taking a role so demanding that only a handful of performers can actually sing it while also adjusting to a moving set that requires nimble footwork. No wonder the singers playing Rhinemaidens in harnesses attached to cables that lift them over the stage are more than a little nervous." replacing the ailing Gary Lehman. And in the opening night performance of ���Das Rheingold �۝ at the climactic moment the gods cross the rainbow bridge to Valhalla the machine stalls and refuses to move. In a lighter moment Ms. Voigt exults in her onstage chemistry with Mr. Morris and you can see it in their clinches." Peter Gelb. A calm paternal figure he calls the ���Ring�۝ the hardest and the most exciting project of his life." devoting a couple of paragraphs to each opera. The film also has some built-in advertising: In before-and-after interviews skeptical patrons who worry it will be a ���light show�۝ or too Cirque du Soleil-like pronounce themselves to be satisfied." ���Wagner�۪s Dream�۝ is remarkably free of hysteria.

�۝ the first feature by the Argentine-born New York-based Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija. The subject of this film is a 60-year-old retired rice farmer living in a rural village in Chiang Mai province of northern Thailand. This 2 �_-hour film which is described by Mr. Tiravanija as ���not a documentary and not a narrative�۝ but ���more of a portraiture �۝ rewards concentration once you adjust to its glacial pace and its radically minimalist aesthetic. It has no screenplay or story line." a humble well-liked man might be retired but he is far from idle. The film shows Lung Neaw (Lung is a Thai courtesy title meaning Uncle) going about his daily rituals as he goes to market hunts visits a forest to pick herbs for cooking bathes in a river prays chops wood and takes a long walk during which the nearly stationary camera observes him from afar for several minutes as he recedes into the distance. The camera is so unobtrusive that in a scene of Lung Neaw and a woman (presumably his wife) cooking dinner their backs are turned as they meticulously prepare the food. Many of Lung Neaw�۪s tasks are followed from beginning to end." as trees are cut down to create rice fields. In another Lung Neaw calmly acknowledges that his generation may be the last to live this kind of existence. In yet another he and an acquaintance confess to occasional bouts of loneliness." he is really a global Everyman." �۝ shot with a 16-millimeter camera is visually sumptuous. The electric greens of the fields and forests evoke an all-embracing fecundity. If you imagined that a rural Asian farmer didn�۪t enjoy as full a life as the most sophisticated and well-traveled urbanite the film should make you think again."

the serial con artist Fr̩d̩ric Bourdin ���The Imposter�۝ is slippery manipulative unstable and smoothly confounding. It�۪s also one of the most entertaining documentaries to appear since ���Exit Through the Gift Shop �۝ a film similarly obsessed with role playing and deception." the British director Bart Layton presents this bizarre true-crime narrative from multiple viewpoints. The resulting collage of interviews re-enactments and home-video footage proves the perfect medium for the twisty story of Nicholas Barclay a Texas teenager who disappeared in 1994." three years and some months later a carefully camouflaged Mr. Bourdin surfaced in Spain claiming to be the missing boy and armed with horrific details of torture and abuse no one should have believed him. How could a 23-year-old raven-haired French-Algerian pass himself off as a 16-year-old blond blue-eyed American?" familial self-deception and ingenious duplicity. But Mr. Layton is less concerned with trapping the truth than in laying out its many disguises: invariably cocooned in a selection of hoodies hats and scarves Mr. Bourdin (and his stand-in for re-enactments Adam O�۪Brian) slinks through the film like a mutating virus. Everyone is contaminated from Child Protective Services and the United States Embassy in Madrid to the American news media and the F.B.I. And not least Nicholas�۪s traumatized family." �۝ Mr. Bourdin boasts of his initial meeting with Nicholas�۪s older sister Carey Gibson whose face in interviews bears the look of a woman who expected a puppy for Christmas and unwrapped a viper." leaving us to wonder how long the ruse would have continued had not an unlikely hero hustled forward in the folksy form of Charlie Parker a private investigator and inveterate clue sniffer. Round of belly and suspicious of mind Mr. Parker pounces on the story wrestles it to the ground and makes off with it to a destination that calls into question almost everything we have just seen." Mr. Bourdin presides over this tragedy with repulsive self-regard. But his director working with the editor Andrew Hulme refuses to cede control of the film�۪s tone. Using unexpected flares of humor ��� when a telephone rings in a police station it�۪s answered by a delightful montage of famous small-screen detectives ��� and defiantly jaunty rhythms Mr. Layton lightens the mood without making light of the crime. His subject does that all by himself." but mostly lies damned lies and no statistics whatsoever."

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/movies/farewell-my-queen-set-at-versailles.html
My Queen �۝ Benǫt Jacquot�۪s tense absorbing pleasurably original look at three days in the life and lies of a doomed monarch opens with a young woman shaking off sleep and scratching mosquito bites on her arm. It�۪s a lovely arm as no less than Marie Antoinette (the well-cast Diane Kruger) proclaims. The young woman is Sidonie Laborde (L̩a Seydoux fittingly recessive) who serves as the queen�۪s reader. Smitten as well as bitten Sidonie adores the queen and luxuriates in her good graces. Sidonie also reads plays novels and even fashion magazines to the queen as Marie Antoinette lazes in her bed at Versailles pretty as a Fragonard picture while France violently seethes." 1789 the day the Bastille fell. For Sidonie the morning seems like any other with an early rise a splash of lavender water and a jittery dash to the queen�۪s quarters. On her way Sidonie slips to the ground suggesting her subservience and foreshadowing the greater fall to come. As usual in this deftly handled movie Mr. Jacquot doesn�۪t linger on the obvious in this case her tumble but cuts to Sidonie looking around as if to see if anyone has noticed. At Versailles etiquette was all. And ���life at court �۝ the 17th-century moralist Jean de La Bruy̬re wrote ���is a serious melancholy game.�۝" which was written by Mr. Jacquot and Gilles Taurand and based on a novel by the French writer Chantal Thomas. It seems possible that Mr. Jacquot also dipped into Ms. Thomas�۪s ���Wicked Queen: The Origins of the Myth of Marie-Antoinette �۝ a cultural history that explores the mythifying of the queen largely through the pamphlets written about her. Widely disseminated before the revolution and even after heads began rolling the pamphlets started off as fairly benign more Us Weekly than Foreign Affairs ��� Marie Antoinette�۪s imperial bouffant was mocked along with her manners ��� but later become more pointed and politically expedient." in Ms. Thomas�۪s words ���from laughter to reprobation.�۝ Marie Antoinette was attacked from nose tip to toe her body becoming a symbolic site of battle. Specifically it was a foreign (she was Austrian) increasingly sexualized body that as the antiroyalist rhetoric heated up became perversity incarnate. She was accused of participating in orgies and carrying on with other women. (At her trial in 1793 she was also accused of incest with her son.) The author of one pamphlet feverishly wrote that her mirrors multiplied ���all the finer points of her venereal gymnastics.�۝ The propagandistic usefulness of the tracts was as naked as the queen�۪s lust was said to be as in the 1789 screed ���The Austrian Woman on the Rampage or the Royal Orgy.�۝" using it as a stage to introduce some of the larger dramas unfolding at the palace. This set piece opens shortly after Sidonie takes her introductory spill. Her dress muddied she runs up the stairs to the queen�۪s bedroom only to be scolded for her tardiness by Madame Campan (No̩mie Lvovsky a sly scene stealer) the tremulously watchful lady-in-waiting. As they are about to enter the chamber a third woman later identified as Gabrielle de Polignac (Virginie Ledoyen) loudly flounces out of Marie Antoinette�۪s bedroom without casting a single look at the hovering women and guards. Palace rumor has it that this is the queen�۪s lover and she plays the court game well." increasingly dangerous court intrigue remain obscure it�۪s because ���Farewell My Queen�۝ is told through Sidonie�۪s eyes. She isn�۪t a privileged witness to history (or an all-knowing character) but she�۪s resourceful. Tapping her palace sources notably an archivist (Michel Robin) and a dressmaker (Anne Benǫt) Sidonie learns of news known only to the nobility and their trusted stewards: that the Bastille has been seized. ���What will happen to us?�۝ she asks eyes wide. Her limited knowledge combined with what history tells us (even in foggy memory) invests the movie with the shiver of a murder mystery. Like everyone else she doesn�۪t have the answer to that question but the fear in their faces suggests that they already know." and it�۪s a welcome return. (His films include ���A Single Girl �۝ with the teenage Ms. Ledoyen.) Mr. Jacquot has always been a sensitive director of actresses his sympathies evident in his caressing sometimes ogling camerawork and the time and space he gives women and their stories. That sympathy is evident here too though crucially while he doesn�۪t demonize Marie Antoinette he doesn�۪t turn her into a spurious feminist martyr. He tends not to trumpet his politics; he does brandish a few dead rats some of Versailles�۪s other inhabitants. But because he shows you what Sidonie sees in the queen ��� and what the queen sees in Gabrielle ��� he finds truths beyond the era�۪s misogynist propaganda." My Queen�۝ has none of the mustiness or preciosity that can turn costume dramas into waxworks. Mr. Jacquot shot much of it at Versailles which deepens the period verisimilitude yet while the gilded rooms and satin clothes look sumptuous if often suitably absurd almost clownish the people in them breathe. That�۪s even true in several stunning scenes when the palace nobles having heard the bad news from Paris wander the halls in a daze their bodies shadowed by the wavering candlelight their unanswered servant bells ringing. Mr. Jacquot isn�۪t seeking pity for these walking dead ��� the movie is neither a political argument nor a trivializing fantasy ��� but as he does with Marie Antoinette he grants them a kind of measured absolution just by recognizing their humanity." My Queen�۝ is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) The movie has brief nudity and modest sexual groping but it does not have the profanity or violence common in R-rated American movies."

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/movies/union-square-by-nancy-savoca-with-mira-sorvino.html
�۝ Nancy Savoca�۪s long-awaited return to feature filmmaking is the tale of two sisters divided by temperament geography and class. The first one we meet is Lucy (Mira Sorvino) a whirlwind of attitude and emotion who blows into Manhattan with her smartphone her lap dog and no small amount of emotional baggage. After a bunch of angry texts and phone conversations with her married lover (who is never seen and barely heard) and a bout of extreme shopping in the discount emporiums on 14th Street Lucy arrives at the apartment of her sister Jenny (Tammy Blanchard)." and it takes the viewer a moment to comprehend that these women are related by blood. It�۪s not just that Lucy is noisy tall and blond while Jenny is diffident and darker-haired. Jenny it seems has turned herself into a point-by-point rebuttal of everything her sister represents. If you listen closely you might hear a hint of their working-class Bronx background in Jenny�۪s voice; with Lucy it�۪s about as subtle as a car horn in heavy traffic. Jenny whose future in-laws think she grew up in Maine acts out a daily caricature of repressed genteel propriety words that no one would think to apply to her sister." and the details of their estrangement are both vague and a little implausible. But Ms. Savoca who wrote the script with Mary Tobler is less concerned with shoehorning the characters into a neat story than in watching them bounce around in a confined space filled with unruly unwelcome feeling." secrets spill out grudges are aired and a great deal of organic vodka is drunk some of it in the company of Sara (Daphne Rubin-Vega) a friend from the old neighborhood who mortifies Jenny almost as much as Lucy does. Jenny�۪s fianc̩ Bill (Mike Doyle) square-jawed and well bred is a gracious if somewhat baffled host though Jenny seems a little afraid of him. It may just be that she is terrified that her elaborate fragile charade will be wrecked by her sister. It may also be that such wreckage is precisely what Lucy intends." who has devoted her life above all to maintaining order and decorum. Her tidy apartment ��� it serves as headquarters for the mail-order health food company she and Bill run together ��� is a temple of rules: no shoes no smoking no meat no loud voices or messy feelings." and the same might be said about ���Union Square�۝ itself. Ms. Sorvino a naturally warm and funny actress has been too scarce a presence on movie screens in recent years and her brassy heartfelt performance cries out for melodrama on a larger scale. Ms. Savoca makes the most of limited resources ��� a small cast a few locations a digital camera ��� and she too could have used more room to stretch out." ���Dogfight�۝ (1991) and the splendid ���Household Saints�۝ (1993) ��� are at once modest and richly imagined with a novelistic sense of character and detail. ���Union Square�۝ has the busy hemmed-in talkiness of a theater piece with too much forced to happen in too short a time. But it also has a lively nervous energy and an expansive sympathy for the mismatched women at its heart."

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/movies/trishna-from-michael-winterbottom-starring-freida-pinto.html
you may wonder what the British filmmaker Michael Winterbottom was after with ���Trishna �۝ his arid take on the novel. Set in contemporary India it stars the Indian actress Freida Pinto as the title character a poor country lass who falls for a rake Jay (Riz Ahmed). Jay pursues Trishna and then abandons her literally and emotionally only to return to her arms amid a great deal of melodramatic busyness pulsing colors churning dust and very little heat." she�۪s working in a resort in her hometown in Rajasthan in northwest India and he�۪s bumming around with friends getting stoned and sharing blunts. The son of a wealthy speculator (Roshan Seth) Jay chases her but traditional Trishna keeps him demurely at bay. When an accident sidelines her father she steps in as the family provider and accepts Jay�۪s offer of a job at one of his father�۪s hotels. Trishna and Jay draw close but after a murky encounter involving either rape or a fraught seduction she returns home. Jay then follows Trishna and asks her to live with him in Mumbai and she shyly smiles yes setting her on her fateful course." a bit to Bollywood and too much to Mr. Winterbottom�۪s unfortunate decisions. ���Trishna�۝ is attractive if not memorably so filled with pretty young people and location shooting that borders on tourist-board friendly. Ms. Pinto best known for ���Slumdog Millionaire �۝ is one of its loveliest attractions but she and her director haven�۪t been able to give Trishna a pulse. It�۪s hard to pinpoint whether Mr. Winterbottom Ms. Pinto or some combination of the two couldn�۪t make Trishna come alive. The wild overediting only becomes more frenetic as the drama thickens ��� as if to imply depths of feeling not visible in the acting or mise-en-sc̬ne ��� which suggests he was trying to cut around the performance." who despite the costume and location changes her smiles and unpersuasive moans of pleasure begins and ends as a victim. A victim who because Mr. Winterbottom focuses on her context and can�۪t dig into her consciousness much less move between them remains at an emotional remove. If you haven�۪t read Hardy�۪s novel it may be hard to grasp what Jay sees in her beyond the crudely obvious. If you have read the book in which Tess is thrillingly human ��� passive and active marble and flesh ��� you can only rue Mr. Winterbottom�۪s reading of ���Tess�۝ that underscores its determinism and turns its heroine into a decorative vessel for that fatalism." following ���Jude �۝ a period adaptation of ���Jude the Obscure �۝ and ���The Claim �۝ which loosely transposed ���The Mayor of Casterbridge�۝ to 1860s California. Mr. Winterbottom has said he first read ���Jude the Obscure�۝ when he was a teenager and reread it several more times. He grew up to become a mercurial filmmaker who changes his visual style as often as he does subjects and whose films even the nonliterary ones share a pessimism that may be traceable to reading too much Hardy at a tender age. Even ���The Trip �۝ Mr. Winterbottom�۪s funny gastronomic excursion through the Lake District of England with the comics Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon is touched by gloominess unrelated to the weather." as the Buddha said (including in Hardy�۪s emotionally grinding novels) but it�۪s more complex and contradictory than the ginned-up realism Mr. Winterbottom delivers here. Given this it�۪s curious that he called his heroine Trishna which is the second of the four noble truths the foundation of Buddhist thought. Life is suffering is the first noble truth; the second is that suffering is caused by thirst (Trishna) ��� craving desire attachment. Craving causes suffering but ideally also leads to enlightenment. This paradox brings to mind that even brutal art has its moment of transcendence. However bleak a novel like ���Tess�۝ is its own slice of nirvana because of the magnificence of its ideas the glory of its writing and its glimmers of hope which have no equal in ���Trishna" some sex."

in which a na��ve one-issue candidate for Seattle City Council goes up against a solidly entrenched incumbent. The movie directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal (father of Jake and Maggie) feels more like a countercultural comedy than a sober civics lesson. Although it only glosses the mechanics of local politics it exudes an endearingly scruffy charm." Grant Cogswell (Joel David Moore) is an eccentric freelance music critic who likes to waddle around the city dressed as a polar bear. His opponent in the council election Richard McIver (Cedric the Entertainer) is one of the few African-American politicians to hold office in Seattle. This bothers Grant�۪s equality-minded liberal supporters but Grant remains undaunted. In the early days of the campaign Grant casually refers to his rival as ���the Devil�۝ during a debate but Mr. McIver is portrayed as a polished courtly blank slate who calmly remains above the fray." which he insists would solve many of the area�۪s transportation and social problems if it were extended throughout Seattle.

Set in the late 19th century when the first waves of European Jews were fleeing persecution for new beginnings in a very old land the film tells a historical story grounded in personal drama without making much of a fuss or an impact." a survivor of Russian pogroms arrives in Palestine with an aging uncle a shellshocked brother and a baby daughter. The widower Yechiel (Zion Ashkenazi) takes an interest in the pretty hard-working but underskilled immigrant yet their agreement to wed is less a matter of romance than another example of the trust required when there�۪s no turning back. Mr. Wolman�۪s film makes clear that there�۪s little room for error when farming is a rocky Sisyphean endeavor and when neighbors (Arabs with whom the Jewish settlers share a well) are wary." which has been acclaimed for its feminist protagonist ���Gei Oni�۝ benefits from Ms. Alkan�۪s portrayal of determination shadowed by fragility. Mr. Wolman avoids gratuitous ennoblement of his characters but this veteran filmmaker lets tension seep out of tough scenes and tends to telegraph the drama of longer sequences. The film which sags with some weak supporting cast members peters out even as the couple face a painful revelation from Fania�۪s past. For a story of survival the full potential of the richly resonant history at hand feels untapped."

This too is apt since one theme of the movies in question ��� I�۪m thinking of ���Dogtooth�۝ and ���Attenberg�۝ as well as Yorgos Lanthimos�۪s ���Alps �۝ the subject of this review ��� is the absurd and alarming divergence of language from its objects." nightmarishly home-schooled children in ���Dogtooth �۝ also directed by Mr. Lanthimos have been taught a perverse vocabulary: they think a sea is a kind of chair and a zombie a type of flower. The young woman at the center of ���Attenberg �۝ the most recent film by Athina Rachel Tsangari studies human behavior with the sober curiosity of a visitor from another planet. (Mr. Lanthimos appeared in that film and Ms. Tsangari was a producer of both ���Dogtooth�۝ and ���Alps.�۝)" a mustachioed ambulance attendant who goes by the alias Mont Blanc explains that he has chosen ���Alps�۝ because the word has no obvious connection to the work he and the others do and also because it has a symbolic meaning. The Alps in his view are at once uniquely themselves and able to stand for any other mountains. Thus the woman known as Monte Rosa (Aggeliki Papoulia) is able to impersonate a teenage tennis player and a diabetic who speaks English with her lover." whose vaguely sadomasochistic apparently nonsexual relationship may have an oblique connection to the rest of the group�۪s work. Oblique connections are the threads that hold this film together as Mr. Lanthimos moves from one somber deliberate scene to the next. His wide-screen shallow-focus compositions have a dreamy almost hallucinatory quality that underlines the strangeness of the story." �۝ ���Alps�۝ works by systematically unsettling our sense of what is normal and habitual in human interactions. Would grieving parents or spouses really be comforted by the performances of the Alps whose services they seek out and pay for? It is both an obvious question and one the film waves away. To appreciate what Mr. Lanthimos is doing ���to accept his invitation to rethink some very basic assumptions about identity and feeling ��� you need to accept his peculiar and suggestive premise." or is she playing a role with him? Are her increasingly frequent sexual encounters with ���clients�۝ part of the Alps�۪ service or evidence that she is starting to fall apart?" while Ms. Papoulia (an intense quietly magnetic actress who also appeared in ���Dogtooth�۝) brings an emotional ferocity that prevents the film from turning into an arch intellectual game.

and the meanings of those words have changed but the West ��� California in particular ��� still thrives in the popular imagination as a place where wildness and refinement law and violence inferno and Utopia collide and commingle." in politics and pop culture is the southern one between the United States and Mexico. One of the jokes in ���Savages �۝ Oliver Stone�۪s feverish fully baked half-great adaptation of Don Winslow�۪s ferocious and funny drug-war novel of the same name is that the film�۪s title is flung back and forth between north and south ��� an epithet that is also eventually claimed as a badge of honor. The Southern California marijuana dealers on one side of the conflict that energizes the film�۪s zigzagging narrative are appalled by the brutality of the Mexican narco-traffickers for whom torture and mutilation are routine ways of doing business. Some of the Mexicans in turn are disgusted by the sloth and shallowness of the gringos who seem to lack any sense of dignity tradition family or honor. Savagery is in the eye of the beholder." though prejudices and blind spots make clear judgments doubtful. The judgment of the American weed merchants may be further clouded by their continual violation of a basic rule laid down by Mr. Stone back when he wrote the screenplay for Brian De Palma�۪s ���Scarface�۝: Don�۪t get high on your own supply. (They also ignore another ���Scarface�۝ rule: Never underestimate the other guy�۪s greed.)" best buds who grow the best buds on the planet never think twice about sampling their own wares. Nor does O the movie�۪s narrator and the hypotenuse of a happily triangular domestic m̩nage. Played with radiant vagueness by Blake Lively O explains a lot to us about her own household and the world beyond it. Her real name is Ophelia and the nickname suggests among other things a certain emptiness. But Mr. Stone and Mr. Winslow (who collaborated on the script along with Shane Salerno) don�۪t quite make her into a caricature of vacuous rich-girl blonditude. Instead they allow O to pursue and to represent a version of the American dream that is open to reverence as well as ridicule. She has everything she wants and why shouldn�۪t she?" while she is in her own words ���the only thing they have in common.�۝ Chon is a combat veteran whose tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan have left him cynical and suspicious as well as tactically adept when it comes to dealing with trouble. Ben a Berkeley graduate is sensitive and soulful the poetic yang to Chon�۪s warrior yin. Together they satisfy O and run a lucrative business which Ben enhances by ���going all Bono�۝ and putting some of the profits to global do-gooder use." a kind of transcendental housewife describes their hillside home in Laguna Beach as paradise. Mr. Stone affirms this appraisal with sweeping sun-drenched shots of the water the sky and the golden bodies of Ms. Lively and her co-stars who snuggle together like blissful exceptionally well-proportioned kittens. This director has about as much use for visual austerity as O and her pals would have for a W-2 form and at times in ���Savages�۝ he seems intoxicated by beauty almost to the point of distraction." flinty prose but the sumptuousness of the movie is among its chief delights. Some familiar Oliver Stone tics are evident notably his impatience with any single format or color scheme. Sometimes he shifts to black and white or to webcam and cellphone video but the effect of this kind of scrambling is not as jarring as it used to be. Back in the days of ���JFK�۝ and ���Natural Born Killers�۝ such techniques made him seem like an especially manic postmodernist but now that collage and rapid-fire editing have become more common (and less interesting) cinematic features he turns out to have been a classicist all along." a western a stoner buddy movie and a love story which is to say that it is a bit of a mess. But also a lot of fun especially as its pulp elements rub up against some gritty geopolitical and economic themes. Rather than grandstand about these the filmmakers embed them in a story full of ambushes betrayals and bloody reprisals mostly carried out by an especially vivid cast of villains and double dealers." it can get kind of dull and Ben and Chon cool as they are are not always scintillating company. O seems to run a bit deeper than either of her paramours but the crazy jangly life in this movie comes from John Travolta as a dirty D.E.A. agent Benicio Del Toro and Demi��n Bichir as midlevel criminals and above all Salma Hayek as Elena the ruthless queen bee of a Mexican cartel." with sufficient ingenuity to keep you engaged and digressions that make the movie feel bigger than the sum of its events some of which (be warned) are extremely grisly. It is at bottom a fable of business dealings gone wrong. Elena�۪s company wants to gobble up Ben and Chon�۪s start-up and while the terms seem generous the boys are skeptical. Ignoring their D.E.A. pal�۪s warning ��� ���Don�۪t mess with Walmart �۝ is one of several choice lines bestowed on Mr. Travolta ��� they end up in a nasty fight to save the enterprise and also O whose kidnapping gives the game a personal stake. And for Ben and Chon�۪s enemies too it turns out that nothing is ever just business." even though she is telling the story and her blithe comparisons of Chon and Ben to Butch and Sundance (with herself in the role of Katharine Ross�۪s Etta Place) foreshadow a grim conclusion. What happens is more complicated and may displease some of Mr. Winslow�۪s readers. The way the movie ends can be seen as a cop-out but I think of it more as a sly commentary on the kind of stories American movies love to tell and also on the nature of our appetite for those stories." thanks. Like O we�۪re glad to have it both ways: rough and sweet cynical and na��ve champion and underdog. We want everything all the time including our innocence." drugs blood gore. Love it or leave it!"

at times low-energy haunted house flick ���The Pact�۝ is the sort of exploitation cheapie that trades on the usual creaking floorboards dark closets modest scares lethal weapons pretty women and pretty dead women ��� which for certain horror enthusiasts makes it inherently worth a look. Its premise is as familiar as its storybook particulars and the whole thing skews so simple it can be summed up in one hyperventilated line something like ���You can�۪t go home again ... alive!�۝ Back in the grind-house day Roger Corman would have hired its director Nicholas McCarthy in a heartbeat." a motorcycle-riding waif Annie (Caity Lotz a sympathetic presence) peels off her black leather jacket and confronts the creepy stuff that happened once upon a time. She�۪s returned to her childhood home of horrors after her sister Nicole (Agnes Bruckner) has stopped returning calls. A single mother with a shady past and a cross inked on her arm Nicole had gone back to the same house after their mother died. Annie thinks Nicole a former druggie has simply bailed. Then a shut closet door opens seemingly unaided and a sense of disquiet enters as does the hope that Mr. McCarthy making his feature debut has a grasp on his material." as a solid scene is followed by a shakier one that in turn is answered by one that sends a nice shiver up your spine. Part of the problem is inexperience; he can�۪t (yet) direct his way around weak performers. And there are moments when Mr. McCarthy becomes bogged down with exposition and character background that are less interesting than the fun he has by opening and closing doors cranking the music up and down and punctuating scenes with abrupt edits. There�۪s some self-conscious playfulness here though it�۪s unclear whether all the laughs are intentional as when a wigged-out Nicole asks why a cop Creek (Casper Van Dien of ���Starship Troopers�۝ cult fame) doesn�۪t believe her supernatural-sounding explanation for the weird doings." and sometimes it feels particularly in the baggy middle as if he didn�۪t have enough material for an extended-play version. The opening though with Nicole alone in the house does work and there�۪s a nice and uneasy passage when as she�۪s trying to catch a Wi-Fi signal while on Skype she walks around holding her laptop in front of her the camera and an unseen wicked something or someone you intuit trailing her. These gliding camera movements ��� partly courtesy of the director of photography Bridger Nielson and the Steadicam operator Liam Clark ��� suggest elevated directorial ambition even as the grayish thin-looking digital gives the movie a fittingly low-rent straight-to-cable visual quality." scrutinizing old photographs tracking down clues and talking to various others (including a spooky medium played with eyeball-rolling showmanship by Haley Hudson) it can seem as if Mr. McCarthy had lost his thread. Is this a haunted house tale a mommy-dearest mystery or a psycho puzzler and does it matter? In the end like a lot of genre movies this one pulls from different inspirations and so weighs in by turns as overly predictable and satisfyingly recognizable (part of genre cinema�۪s one-two punch). More important as Annie moves toward the big reveal Mr. McCarthy throws in enough shivery details ��� eerie phone messages elliptically passing shadows and a mysterious figure slithering like a snake through a tiny entranceway ��� to keep you agreeably jumpy."

Monte and Charlotte who fall half in love in the wary manner of adults with clearly defined boundaries interact with a courtly dignity. Not until the end of the summer do they abandon the quaint formality of addressing each other as Mr. Wildhorn and Mrs. O�۪Neil." more innocent time has been a current in Mr. Reiner�۪s films as far back as ���Stand by Me �۝ in 1986.

There�۪s more to Mr. Weaving than a spooky voice though but you need to look into the quieter corners of the movie world for the fuller picture." a guy with a rock for a heart and a sensitive 10-year old son Chook (Tom Russell) who from his first trembling moment seems destined to smash that heart to pieces. Early on you grasp their dynamic when they enter a fast-food place where Kev heads straight for the bathroom leaving Chook to his own devices. Once in the can Kev cuts his shoulder-length hair short and trims his beard. He stares hard into the mirror and when he emerges Chook looks him over. ���You look weird �۝ he says capping his review with a spew of vomit. It�۪s a warning sign for a relationship that as they travel on and off the road gathers in mystery if not in depth." when Kev furtively abandons their car unscrewing and pocketing a license plate there�۪s little doubt that he and Chook are running from something. The director Glendyn Ivin doesn�۪t initially explain what and why but it�۪s easy to piece together the reasons from what�۪s said and not as well as from the snippets of news. The screenwriter Mac Gudgeon working from a novel by Denise Young more expansively titled ���The Last Ride �۝ fills out the story with natural-sounding stop-and-go conversations traded jokes informational exchanges and the like rather than conspicuously expository passages. The two main characters talk rather than slog or sift through their feelings. This strengthens the realism particularly because Kev is fairly laconic and Chook isn�۪t especially chatty." suggestively toggling between man and nature. Many of the earlier scenes take place indoors including an uneasy nicely handled interlude at the home of an old acquaintance Maryanne (Anita Hegh) who isn�۪t initially glad to see the travelers. As the story winds on Kev and Chook travel deep then deeper into the outback and across desolate vistas rich in weird beauty as if on a father-son walkabout. Mr. Ivin doesn�۪t have a strong narrative line to play with or become distracted by but he takes off on some lovely detours whether he�۪s narrowing in on Chook or going wide to take in the world that waits beyond." and he matches Kev�۪s quieter moments with gestures that are similarly controlled until they�۪re abruptly not. This restraint draws you closer to Kev ��� he seems like an enigma worth exploring ��� even as he then repulses you with his violence including toward Chook. Kev is mean and often frightening a volcano on the verge of inundating everything within distance. But what Mr. Weaving and Mr. Ivin never lose sight of is that Kev is Chook�۪s father. The boy loves Kev and wants to be loved by him which is crucial to the story�۪s emotional stakes. Yet the child�۪s love is easy. What�۪s tougher and could have been lingered over longer is that in his hard hurting way Kev loves Chook a truth that neither ever really escapes."

Illustrating the film�۪s rags-to-ring narrative with panoramic mountain views and compact shots of young bodies punching their way up the food chain Mr. Sun straddles ancient and modern tranquillity and turmoil with equal sureness." �۝ the story concentrates on the mental and physical hurdles of two talented friends from Sichuan Province. Recruited as 12-year-olds in 2004 (five years before we meet them) and installed in boxing training camp the boys respond very differently to the punishing schedule and barrackslike accommodations." Olympic glory is not enough: He longs to be a ���boxing king�۝ like his idol Mike Tyson." �۝ he tells his parents hardworking tobacco farmers who seem embarrassed by his immodesty. By contrast his friend He Zongli may be less certain that battering others is the kind of upward mobility he wants to embrace." ���Up the Yangtze �۝ Mr. Chang quietly observes the tension between individual ambition and national identity. Though limited by gender ��� I would have liked to learn more about the female trainees than their habit of dissolving in giggles around their charismatic coach ��� this remarkably tender portrait positions a particularly violent sport as nothing less than a lifeline to the 21st century."

�۝ attending a Katy Perry concert is like being shot with an arrow of Katy Perryness. To watch the movie a 3-D concert documentary directed by Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz is to be subjected to an artillery barrage of Katy Perryness. Not only from on screen but also from the screaming cheering weeping singing-along members of the audience some of whom will be wearing Katy Perry costumes not all of whom will be teenage girls. You would not believe how much Katy Perryness there is in the world." evident in ���Part of Me�۝ and on the yearlong tour it chronicles is friendly and inclusive as well as cannily professional. Video clips of young admirers testifying to the positive effect she has had on their lives are sweet but perhaps redundant given the sugar rush of positive attitude her concerts deliver. It is hardly an accident that lollipops chocolate Kisses and other kinds of candy figure prominently in her costumes and stage designs." industrious personification of the marvelous paradoxes that contemporary commercial music encompasses. The child of traveling Pentecostal preachers ��� who appear in the film in old video and in present-day interviews and who seem both proud of their daughter and mildly disapproving about some of her creative choices ��� she migrated while still a teenager from Christian music into wilder secular styles. (She also moved from respectable Santa Barbara to club-kid Los Angeles.) Her first major influence was Alanis Morissette whose crafty large-voiced emotionalism is reflected in some of Ms. Perry�۪s more introspective less bouncy songs." though (after she emerged from a spell in record-label limbo briefly revisited in ���Part of Me�۝) was ���I Kissed a Girl �۝ a teasing infectious decidedly nonangsty confession of adolescent bi-curiosity and tipsy indiscretion. The slowed-down torched-up version performed onstage in the film taps into melodramatic undercurrents unexplored in the original which was one of the unavoidable sounds of 2008." ���I Kissed a Girl�۝ set the template for the aspect of Katy Perryness that might test the limits of the PG rating this film has earned. Ms. Perry combines with an ease and insouciance that is quite remarkable when you think about it a childlike kittens-and-rainbows innocence with frank declarations of and incitements to lust." but once they are in your head they will never go away. Her sexual imagination runs the gamut from the suggestive (���sun-kissed skin so hot/ we�۪ll melt your Popsicle�۝) to the baldly literal (���we went streaking in the park/skinny-dipping in the dark/then had a m̩nage �� trois�۝)." thanks to Ms. Perry�۪s gift for the radio-friendly hook and her all-around niceness. ���I guess she�۪s a good role model �۝ a mother was heard to say after a recent screening of ���Part of Me �۝ and after seeing the movie ��� which emphasizes Ms. Perry�۪s generosity to fans loyalty to friends and family avowed feminism and unpretentious work ethic ��� you may find it hard to disagree. But at the same time role model may not be precisely the right term. Really Ms. Perry is an alluring but ultimately safe fantasy figure an expression of dreams and desires that are not as contradictory as they might seem." however are all of them equally accessible. One of the curious features of modern musical celebrity is the idea that it is transferable that a pop idol�۪s success is shared with and somehow available to her fans. And so as we sample her wildly glamorous life and revel in her amazing achievements ��� during her 2011 tour she became the first female artist to have five No. 1 songs from a single album ��� we are also reminded that she is deep down a regular person." Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers. Most simply she just has more talent than any of them and her songs have a wider emotional range. But the film also catches glimpses of the unraveling of her marriage to the British actor and comedian Russell Brand which gives it an undercurrent of classic backstage melodrama." as well as every other color) but her negotiation of the painfully competing demands of stardom and marriage is undeniably poignant. Mr. Brand is barely on screen and we don�۪t really know what happened between them but the intrusion of grown-up problems into a fairy-tale world turns the movie into something deeper than it might otherwise have been. By the time the sequel arrives Katy Perryness may have a whole new meaning."

Spidey has it really been five long years since we saw you in ���Spider-Man 3 �۝ where you were plagued by a doppelg�_nger a hectic plot and franchise exhaustion? Way back then you were played by the cute boy-man Tobey Maguire and the girl with the fatal-beauty smile was given sweet life by Kirsten Dunst. Now in ���The Amazing Spider-Man �۝ you�۪re played by the cute boy-man Andrew Garfield whose elongated limbs and pencil neck go a ways to make him look like the geek next door. The lovely young miss meanwhile is Emma Stone whose pillowy lips serve as flotation devices that ��� along with her natural appeal and Mr. Garfield�۪s likability ��� keep this resuscitated studio product from fully capsizing." Marc Webb does his part. Like his debut feature the bittersweet romance ���(500) Days of Summer �۝ Mr. Webb�۪s Spider-Man movie works only because he keeps the whole package at least until the requisite final blowout tethered to his two appealing leads. Both look too old for high school (Mr. Garfield turns 29 in August and Ms. Stone hits the big 24 in November) but then so did the characters introduced by the pen-and-ink legends Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962. If the readers who embraced the square-looking Peter Parker didn�۪t mind maybe it was partly because this awkward outsider spoke to his times having been bitten by a radioactive spider the same year the United States conducted 36 atmospheric nuclear weapon tests over the Pacific." but it�۪s unclear whom he speaks to (beyond Sony�۪s shareholders) and for what reason. Like the 2002 ���Spider-Man �۝ the first of three movies directed by Sam Raimi ���The Amazing Spider-Man�۝ revisits Peter Parker�۪s origin story. This time it opens with the child Peter and his parents Richard and Mary (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) who after a break-in at their house endangering Dad�۪s scientific secrets rush over to Richard�۪s brother and sister-in-law a k a Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Martin Sheen and Sally Field a cozy fit). Parking the boy there for safekeeping the parents weep and hug goodbye ��� ���Be good �۝ the father portentously tells the son ��� and within seconds the older now orphaned Peter is shrinking around school while eyeing his crush Gwen Stacy (Ms. Stone)." Oscorp) where along comes a spider and so on. Suddenly he isn�۪t in Kansas anymore or rather the poignantly vulnerable human form he came in with: He�۪s faster stronger stickier. His hands and feet adhere to everything he touches though inexplicably this tackiness soon subsides. For a few scenes however this helps give the movie a lift because Peter in hormonally challenged adolescent fashion is taken aback by his scarily fantastically changing body. When he�۪s bothered by some toughs on the subway he jumps up so abruptly he lands on the roof upside down surprising himself as much as the baddies who give futile chase while he scrambles up up and away." wisely leaning on physical stunts and not just computer-generated imagery exploits Peter�۪s metamorphosis for a few diverting palpable sequences including an extended scene in a desolate warehouse where alone with his skateboard he soars high higher highest. He also smashes an alarm clock on waking accidentally snaps door handles off and snatches a fly live out of the air a buzzy encounter that amusingly brings to mind Norman Bates. It�۪s too bad that Mr. Webb didn�۪t make more of Mr. Garfield�۪s reedy bobbing-neck resemblance to Anthony Perkins. Like that psycho Norman who says he wouldn�۪t hurt a fly Peter is a divided soul (if nicer) but like Mr. Raimi�۪s bug boy it takes him time to figure out who he is physically metaphysically existentially." it takes an increasingly dull drawn-out 136 minutes to work through a story that many moviegoers older than 10 may think they�۪ve seen because they probably did when the first movie burned up the box office. Some of the characters have changed ��� here it�۪s the blond Gwen instead of the redheaded Mary Jane the green Lizard instead of the Green Goblin the supercilious Captain Stacy instead of the supersilly newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson ��� as has the balance between the blue and red on Spidey�۪s suit. Mr. Webb has given the story intimacy scaling down a lot of action and handing over screen time to Peter and Gwen�۪s his-and-her charm. Yet despite this and the snazzier special effects so much looks sounds feels the same even in Imax and 3-D." they add warmth and a believable closeness to the industrial mix. (Ms. Field wearing hippie hair and her trademark indulging smile also helps keep her scenes real.) Mr. Garfield who played Eduardo Saverin Mark Zuckerberg�۪s aggrieved roommate in ���The Social Network �۝ comfortably slips into the dual role of Peter Parker and Spider-Man without reinventing either. He�۪s one of those professionally sensitive young types with a catch in his voice and moony eyes and has had trouble holding the screen or your interest. Here though he responds to Mr. Webb�۪s close attentions ��� the director repeatedly pulls off Spider-Man�۪s mask to show off those puppy eyes ��� and to Ms. Stone�۪s generosity as a performer." unlike Christopher Nolan�۪s ���Batman Begins �۝ which reconceptualized the big-screen franchise ushering it into the noirish reaches familiar from both the initial comic book and Frank Miller�۪s 1980s ���Dark Knight�۝ redo this ���Spider-Man�۝ feels like one of those unnecessary software versions more Spider-Man 1.5 than Spider-Man reborn. Mr. Webb either didn�۪t have a vision for a new ��� nicer or nastier stranger or more perverse ��� Spider-Man or he and the writers (James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves) weren�۪t allowed to take true imaginative flight at a company that�۪s conspicuously banking on a resuscitated franchise to carry it through its next fiscal quarters. Spider-Man�۪s ethos remains ��� With great power comes great responsibility ��� but these days you can�۪t see his superhero heart and soul for his branding." child peril and intimations of another New York apocalypse."

George has a disrespectful daughter (Danielle Campbell) who would benefit from a Madea beat down but when it comes it�۪s uncharacteristically tame. And when Mr. Perry finds an excuse to send Madea through airport security her reaction to the intrusiveness is tamer than what you�۪d see in an average real-life airport screening.

This makes it a bit awkward when they discover sharing a cab from the airport that Daniel lives across the street from the charming cozy row house where Margot lives with her husband Lou (Seth Rogen)." which in spite of moments of frictions and miscommunication is playful and affectionate. (Mr. Rogen turns his natural clowning charm into an aspect of Lou�۪s personality that is for Margot both comforting and annoying.) Daniel for his part does not push himself on Margot but does not exactly push her away either. He hovers in the middle distance letting her know that he is interested and available should her ambivalence resolve in his favor." �۝ Sarah Polley�۪s honest sure-footed emotionally generous second feature. Ms. Williams one of the bravest and smartest actresses working in movies today portrays a young woman who is indecisive and confused but never passive. Margot�۪s uncertainty as she and Ms. Polley understand it is a kind of passion in its own right. The current of her desire runs strongly in two directions: toward the man she knows and loves and toward the stranger she wants in ways beyond her immediate understanding." decent and disciplined but also selfish needy and coy. Nobody in this film is just one way. Ms. Polley as a writer a director of actors and a constructor of images excels at managing the idiosyncrasies and contradictions of her characters so that our knowledge of them is both intimate and mined with potential surprise. Margot and Daniel don�۪t know what they are going to do and Lou does not know what is happening and for most of the movie we dwell in a similar state of suspense and partial knowledge." highly specific place. Toronto which has obligingly impersonated just about every other North American city for decades is here given the chance to play itself to show off its special blend of dowdiness and sophistication. Speaking of the glories of Canada ���Take This Waltz�۝ is also a tribute to the genius of Leonard Cohen. The title is taken from one of his songs which accompanies an astonishing (and very sexy) montage late in the film. We also hear at another crucial point in the drama the Nova Scotia-born singer Feist�۪s ebullient uncompromising cover of ���Closing Time.�۝" �۝ which Mr. Cohen himself has said is overused in films and on television. The lyrics to that song nevertheless contain a line that resonates through Ms. Polley�۪s movie: ���All I ever learned from love was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.�۝ In other words how to turn vulnerability into advantage. How to cheat. The wounding power of love its essential asymmetry and unfairness permeates ���Take This Waltz.�۝ The one thing you know for sure is that someone ��� maybe everyone ��� is going to get hurt." color and warmth some of it supplied by a supporting cast that most notably includes Sarah Silverman as Lou�۪s wise and troubled sister Geraldine. The story takes its time unfolding and pauses to linger over funny odd and touching details. The camera (Luc Montpellier is the director of photography) is as sensitive as Margot herself to nuances of feeling and perception." ���Away From Her �۝ was based on an Alice Munro short story and Margot with her mix of good sense and capriciousness resembles some of Ms. Munro�۪s heroines. In a Munro story the men might not be as nice but the balance of clarity and compassion in ���Take This Waltz�۝ suggests that this writer continues to exert an influence over Ms. Polley." and also at obviousness. There is a striking scene in a swimming pool shower room where Geraldine Margot and another friend chat idly about sex marriage and other matters. A group of older women is in another part of the room and Ms. Polley cuts from one set of naked bodies to the other noting the contrasts of size shape and firmness. It�۪s hard to miss the point ��� young flesh will age; old flesh was once young; time wins in the end ��� but it�۪s a point worth making." and I still think that stopping there would have made ���Take This Waltz�۝ perfect. But I�۪m also willing to grant that perfection may not have been Ms. Polley�۪s chief concern especially since the great theme of this wonderful movie ��� a source of delight as well as distress ��� is that imperfection is all anyone ever learns from love." implicit and explicit."

the gyrating main attraction in Steven Soderbergh�۪s funny enjoyable romp about male strippers and the American dream. Then again few directors can sell the goods ��� whether it�۪s Che in Cuba or Mike in a thong ��� as shrewdly as Mr. Soderbergh. A restive talent who toggles between big-studio and low-budget work he has a genius for wrapping tricky ideas like capitalism and its discontents into commercial packages. Never before has he put them into cheek-baring chaps." smooth as a hairless Chihuahua will receive considerable attention as will the rippling muscles thrusting pelvises and the dancing by turns snaky and acrobatic that are on generous display in ���Magic Mike.�۝ Mr. Tatum who shares producing credit (the movie was written by his production partner Reid Carolin) has said that the story is loosely based on his stint as a stripper in Florida starting when he was 18 a college dropout and flopping on his sister�۪s couch. The dropout here is Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who�۪s crashing with his sister Brooke (Cody Horn) while trying to get his life together. He receives unexpected help when he takes a job at a construction site where he meets an older regular employee Mike who�۪s initially contemptuous of the newcomer." which becomes evident as soon as he takes Adam under his wing first at the construction site and then by bringing the younger man to Xquisite. Initially incredulous and unsettled at some of what he sees at the club Adam changes his mind after he�۪s pushed onstage and to the blunt throbbing of ���Like a Virgin �۝ strips. He takes to the stage like an otter to water slipping and sliding across it and into the lap of an obliging customer. When he comes offstage a smile on his face and his saggy Jockeys stuffed with bills he is a man reborn. It�۪s no wonder that after this memorably frolicking night Adam asks if he can be Mike�۪s best friend." these flicks usually involve a working-class young miss who comically scrambles or crudely tramps her way into a mink swank digs and finally either tragedy or redemption depending on whether she�۪s doomed or saved. Sometimes she also initiates an innocent into her life pretty much the same way Mike brings Adam into his world of sexual play casual drug use and dance music. In the past the movies were very much preoccupied with the moral regulation of women but here the stress is on Mike�۪s struggle to succeed as he juggles his part-time gigs (dancing auto detailing and construction) with his desire to build custom furniture." especially when Mike is dancing bouncing and back-flipping. Set in Tampa (but also shot in California) a palm-lined wasteland that Mr. Soderbergh has washed in somewhat queasy-ugly bleached orange the movie opens at the club with the owner-M.C. Dallas (a spectacular amusingly sleazed-out Matthew McConaughey) running down the rules for the female clientele. ���This is the ���What can you touch and not touch�۪ rule �۝ Dallas says the room erupting in appreciative woos. As he ticks off what customers can and can�۪t grope his hands grab and graze different parts of his body and then he wags a finger and repeatedly says ���no.�۝ ���The law says that you cannot touch �۝ he continues. ���But I think I see a lot of lawbreakers up in this house tonight.�۝" even if the naughtiness remains hidden away from the glare of the outside world. The club is something of a playground a place where women and men teasingly raucously switch traditional roles. Yet there�۪s a serious undertow to their interactions because the women pay men for a sexual pantomime that the men live off of. (The plot also involves Dallas�۪s plans to open a bigger club in which he�۪s promised Mike equity a pledge that keeps Mike dancing and distracted from his own dreams.) From the way that Mr. Soderbergh shoots the opener the lights shining into the camera and your eyes (you may flash on ���All That Jazz�۝) it�۪s clear everyone is playing a role including you." �۝ men exist to be looked at and women do the looking a reverse of the old cinematic divide between the sexes that finds so-called passive women who are looked at by so-called active men. In one school of thought Hollywood movies are always organized for the visual pleasure of the male spectator which pretty much leaves the female spectator sidelined. There�۪s no leaving her out any longer ��� or the gay or confident heterosexual male spectator either. From the way Mr. Soderbergh shoots the raunchy often hilarious vamping dance scenes (Village People Plus) his camera lingering on the undulating bodies ��� the other strippers are played by Matt Bomer Joe Manganiello Adam Rodriguez and Kevin Nash ��� it�۪s clear the director is out to maximize everyone�۪s pleasure." ���Haywire �۝ starring Gina Carano the mixed-martial-arts champ ���Magic Mike�۝ is very much about the beauty of bodies in motion and the deep cinematic joys of watching good-looking people perform extraordinary physical feats. Since parting professional ways with George Clooney whom Mr. Soderbergh helped transform into a star the director has pinned some of his more severe projects to nonintuitive attractions like Ms. Carano and Sasha Grey a former porn actress. He may have been bored with big stars though that�۪s doubtful (there are a few headliners in ���Haywire�۝ and a boatload in ���Contagion�۝). It may have been a matter of money or he may have wanted to see what he could accomplish with non-Hollywood performers." if not impossibly so with the looks of the heartthrob next door and the wrestler�۪s neck jug-handle ears and smiles that help bring him down to earth. Unlike say Matt Damon though Mr. Tatum hasn�۪t yet played smart on screen. He conveys earnestness to the point of goofiness an air of unworldliness bordering on unintelligence that was comically exploited in the buddy comedy ���21 Jump Street.�۝ He doesn�۪t seem like an obvious fit with Mr. Soderbergh." though not on a conspicuous level. Save for a luridly colored bacchanal an entertaining attempt at drug-fueled sex-spiked Expressionism the movie has little of the formal experimentation that sometimes characterizes Mr. Soderbergh�۪s feature-film work. Yet the collaboration between Mr. Soderbergh and the relatively untested Mr. Tatum is itself a gamble one that has brought out the best in each. What could have been an embarrassing misfire hinted at by the movie�۪s misleading trailers is instead a smoothly distilled collaboration that balances Mr. Tatum�۪s heat and charm ��� and ambitions that are as transparent as Mike�۪s ��� with Mr. Soderbergh�۪s cool cinematic intelligence and ongoing preoccupations." including ���The Girlfriend Experience �۝ about a New York prostitute ���Magic Mike�۝ is also very much an inquiry into capitalism and its woes which means that like them it�۪s also about movies. At one point Mike puts on a suit and glasses and tries to secure a bank loan. Mr. Soderbergh plays up the comedy between the stripper and flustered female banker (Betsy Brandt) who says she really really wants to give him what he wants but can�۪t. Mike yearns to make his artisan furniture. The world though wants him to strip and shake his tail. That may not be the subtlest metaphor for the independent filmmaker struggling against the Hollywood machine but like the rest of this movie it works ��� beautifully." partial nudity."

The cleverly animated ursine title character voiced in an exaggerated Boston bray by Mr. MacFarlane himself is a fire hose of vulgarity ethnic insult homophobia and misogyny. In the modern meta manner he (that is Mr. MacFarlane) wants both to indulge and to deny the offensiveness of this material to wallow in ugliness and make fun of it too. It�۪s a wasted effort though. The sin of ���Ted�۝ is not that it is offensive but that it is boring lazy and wildly unoriginal. If Triumph the Insult Comic Dog ever got a hold of Ted there would be nothing left but a pile of fluff and a few scraps of fur." �۝ an animated television series that has hung around in the company of ���The Simpsons�۝ and ���South Park�۝ like an annoying younger cousin bullying and whining its way into a measure of public acceptance.

A cute opening sequence chronicles the granting of John�۪s childhood wish that his beloved bear come to life and the flurry of media attention that followed. In the present John is 35 employed at a Boston car-rental office and romantically attached to Lori (Ms. Kunis)." in spite of the skepticism of her friends and the amorous attention of her boss (Joel McHale). But circumstances and John�۪s own passivity conspire to force him to make a painful choice: the lady or the bear." to pad out the meager plot Ted is menaced by a creepy guy (Giovanni Ribisi) with a creepy mustache and a creepy son (Aedin Mincks).

�۝ the latest from the French director Andr̩ T̩chin̩ often seem to be heading toward one another yet for all their movement forward it can be hard for them to connect. They go in and out of homes boats and beds a rhythmic to-ing and fro-ing matched by the ebbing and flowing of the surrounding water. Set in a less touristy if still impressively lovely Venice than often appears onscreen the film can seem as if it�۪s as unmoored as with all these people coming and going as if Mr. T̩chin̩ had no particular destination in mind for these restless souls." but there�۪s never any doubt that Mr. T̩chin̩ whose films include ���Les Voleurs�۝ and ���Wild Reeds �۝ has a lock on them. It�۪s just that his men and women who here include a writer Francis (the great Andr̩ Dussollier) and a real estate agent Judith (Carole Bouquet) don�۪t exist in a world predetermined either by movie genres or social mores. They are rather characters in a T̩chin̩ film and as such their motivations can be unclear only because however seemingly eccentric they are drawn along the recognizable lines of real life." �۝ the story opens on Francis and Judith who meet ��� and fall for each other ��� when he visits her agency. He comes in looking for an apartment and instead discovers her after suggesting he rent a house on a nearby island she takes him to see it in her small motorboat. Whether it�۪s the house its seductive location or the artwork of a dancing man and woman hanging on one of the walls ��� or whether it�۪s the confidence with which she guides the boat the elegance with which she moves and her genteel hauteur ��� he decides this is the house and woman for him. He asks her to move in. She does." a pouty blank beauty named Alice (M̩lanie Thierry) visits towing along her young daughter Vicky (Zo̩ Duthion). It isn�۪t initially transparent that Alice is Vicky�۪s mother which while slightly confusing both thickens the realism and mirrors the family�۪s blurred relationships. In classic art-film fashion Mr. T̩chin̩ likes to plunge you into the thick of things: you don�۪t learn the characters names for instance until you�۪re well into the story. This means that you sometimes just need to go with what happens and tag alongside the characters as they figure things out. Even so there are moments that seem needlessly oblique including some abruptly introduced surveillance images that suggest Mr. T̩chin̩ was trying to make the story feel more mysterious." but it�۪s engrossing even when its increasingly populated story falters tripped up by unpersuasive actions connections and details. (While never directly explained the title could describe the actions of several of the characters.) Much of the film turns on Francis and Judith�۪s relationship which like the spokes of a bicycle wheel radiates out leading to an assortment of other relationships. The surveillance images prove to be of a prison where a young man J̩r̩mie (Mauro Conte) the son of Judith�۪s friend Anna Maria (Adriana Asti) is serving out a sentence. He has a complex history with his mother and she has a complex history with Judith who has well a complex history of her own." escalating the dramatic confusion: Alice goes missing and Francis who is suffering from writer�۪s block hires Anna Maria ��� a recently retired private investigator ��� to find his daughter. One day Judith visits a drug dealer and ruined aristocrat Alvise (Andrea Pergolesi) in his family�۪s palazzo. It�۪s a handsome haunting shell in which a grand piano sits in one wood-paneled room several men linger in another room while a man shoots up a woman (presumably with heroin) in yet a third.

The movie a passionate and unruly explosion of Americana directed by Benh Zeitlin winks at skepticism laughs at sober analysis and stares down criticism. Made on a shoestring by a resourceful New Orleans-based collective it is animated by the same spirit of freedom it sets out to celebrate. If as the Fourth of July approaches you find yourself craving an antidote to anger and cynicism a bracing reminder of the meaning of independence and a helping of homegrown art to go with your hamburgers and watermelon then this may be just what you need." an untrained sprite who holds the camera�۪s attention with a charismatic poise that might make grown-up movie stars weep in envy Hushpuppy is an American original a rambunctious blend of individualism and fellow feeling. In other words she is the inheritor of a proud literary and artistic tradition following along a crooked path traveled by Huckleberry Finn Scout Finch Eloise (of the Plaza) Elliott (from ���E.T.�۝) and other brave wild imaginary children. These young heroes allow us vicariously to assert our innocence and to accept our inevitable disillusionment when the world falls short of our ideals and expectations." by an awakening mind as opposites ��� what is inside my head and what is outside; what is me and what is not ��� it seems to follow that they must be equal. I too am a cosmos." which is also a state of spiritual insight shaped Terrence Malick�۪s ���Tree of Life �۝ a movie with which ���Beasts of the Southern Wild�۝ has an evident kinship (not only because both films won prizes in Cannes). You might say that Mr. Malick�۪s work is a classical treatment of themes that in Mr. Zeitlin�۪s version are explored through the squawk and heat of blues zydeco and other impure vernacular products of America." whose wide eyes absorb scenes of tenderness and catastrophe and whose lyrical ruminations decorate the soundtrack is a universe in her own right and in her own mind. She confidently predicts that a thousand years in the future ���scientists�۝ will know about her her father (who calls her ���man�۝ and ���boss lady�۝) and the stretch of Louisiana bayou where they live. She knows just how big she is and how powerful." the adult witnesses to her adventures have a slightly different perspective. Objectively Hushpuppy is small and vulnerable and the universe may not care as much about her as it should. She and her father (Dwight Henry) live in neighboring shacks in a place called the Bathtub a swampy scrap of territory separated by a levee from a world of industry consumerism and other forms of modern ugliness. The residents of the Bathtub spend their days fishing scavenging and drinking raising their kids to be self-sufficient and to believe in a folk religion featuring giant ancient creatures called aurochs." both harsh and idyllic is threatened by an epochal hurricane and also by the interference that comes before and after first in the form of orders to evacuate and then in the form of bureaucratic relief efforts. Hushpuppy�۪s father meanwhile is fighting a lethal disease hoping to stay alive long enough to prepare his daughter for an uncertain future." ���Beasts of the Southern Wild�۝ is a work of magic realism and to some extent an exercise in wishful thinking. The Bathtub is a museum of outsider ingenuity its houses and boats cobbled together from weathered detritus its residents wise unpretentious and self-reliant. Mr. Zeitlin shooting on 16-millimeter film rather than in a digital format and aided by his ingenious cinematographer Ben Richardson finds rugged ragged beauty in nearly every shot." you can embrace a vision of multicultural community bound by indifference to the pursuit of wealth and an ethic of solidarity and inclusion. From the right you can admire the libertarian virtues of a band of local heroes who hold fast to their traditions and who flourish in defiance of the meddling good intentions of big government." improbable joy a boisterous thrilling action movie with a protagonist who can hold her own alongside Katniss Everdeen Princess Merida and the other brave young heroines of 2012. There are loose threads you can pull at ��� sometimes the wide-eyed wonder slides toward willful na��vet̩ and there are moments of distracting formal sloppiness ��� but the garment will not come unraveled. A lot of thinking has gone into ���Beasts of the Southern Wild �۝ about themes as well as methods about the significance of the story as well as its shape. And it is certainly rich enough to invite and repay a healthy measure of critical thought." its glory is sensory rather than cerebral. Let me try out an analogy. Discovering this movie is like stumbling into a bar and encountering a band you�۪ve never heard of playing a kind of music that you can�۪t quite identify. Nor can you figure out how the musicians learned to play the way they do with such fire and mastery. Did they pick it up from their grandparents study at a conservatory watch instructional videos on the Internet or just somehow make it all up? Are you witnessing the blossoming of authenticity or the triumph of artifice?" because right now you are transported by an irresistible rhythm and moved by a melody that is profoundly almost primally familiar even though you are sure you have never heard anything like it before."

His new film ���The Invisible War �۝ made in collaboration with Amy Ziering addresses the shockingly common profoundly distressing problem of sexual assault in the United States military. The problem is not exactly a secret. Every now and then a scandal erupts that generates headlines hearings and pious declarations that such conduct is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. You may remember the outcry over what happened at the Tailhook Association meetings in 1991 at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1996 and at the Air Force Academy in 2003. But as Mr. Dick and Ms. Ziering show these high-profile incidents are far from exceptional and the fallout from them has changed very little." 800 violent sex crimes were committed in the military last year alone and the filmmakers calculate that 1 in 5 women in military service has been the victim of sexual assault. ���The Invisible War�۝ presents other numbers mostly from the military�۪s own records that make the picture of pervasive abuse even more alarming. Many crimes are never reported ��� this is true of rape in civilian life as well as in the military ��� but among those that are only a tiny fraction are dealt with in any meaningful way. A culture of impunity has flourished and the film suggests that the military has mostly responded with pathetic attempts at prevention (through posters and public service announcements) and bureaucratic rituals of self-protection." who was a lawyer for the Judge Advocate General�۪s Corps and Capt. Anu Bhagwati a former Marine and the executive director of the Service Women�۪s Action Network ��� who have spent years trying to change the way the military deals with sexual assault. (The Pentagon has recently developed new rules about the reporting of sex crimes which seem intended to address some of the concerns raised by this film). Scholars and legal experts are also heard from as are Defense Department officials and members of Congress from both parties but the heart of the film resides in the testimony of a handful of survivors most but not all of them women." though the candor and bravery displayed in the telling is admirable. Trina McDonald speaks of being drugged and raped while she was stationed at a Naval operating station in Alaska. Elle Helmer assigned to a prestigious posting in Washington was assaulted after enduring months of harassment by her fellow Marines. Kori Cioca�۪s jaw was broken when she says she was raped by a Coast Guard commanding officer. To say that none of them or the others interviewed are satisfied by the military�۪s response would be a gross understatement. In some cases charges were hastily dropped never filed or allowed to drift into administrative limbo. A few assailants were charged with adultery and sometimes astonishingly the victims were too." sailors and Marines. Military service is often a family tradition and the military itself with its customs of loyalty solidarity and shared sacrifice can be a kind of family for its members. This means that the violations chronicled in ���The Invisible War�۝ are compounded by a deep and terrible betrayal which ripples outward from the various branches of the service into the society as a whole. This is not a movie that can be ignored."

It�۪s a welcome unusually introspective interlude that slips into the ecstatic when she scrambles up a rock wall and twirls on its summit laughing happy free and alone." and later when she rebels against the queen you understand what�۪s at stake for her: pleasure independence transcendence. The animation particularly in the outdoor scenes can be transfixing with the photorealist details ��� every blade of grass and each hair in Angus�۪s mane looks perfectly individuated ��� blending seamlessly with the cartoon impressionism. There�۪s an especially enchanting moment during Merida�۪s long ride when she and Angus leap across a fallen tree her hair streaming behind her its tumbling loveliness mirroring both the surrounding forest thicket and the flowing hair on the horse�۪s legs." and in other smarter or maybe just braver hands it might have also inspired new thinking about women men nature and culture. Here however the nature-culture divide is drawn along traditional gender lines. The slim tidy Elinor serves as the custodian of a dreary feminine realm which for Merida means hours indoors being groomed and learning lessons while the freakishly large Fergus represents a rambunctious barely domesticated masculine world of huge appetites tall tales and unruly laughter. Fergus gives Merida a bow and teaches her to shoot in the great outdoors; Elinor primly (and amusingly) tells her daughter ���A lady does not place her weapon on the table.�۝" the queen hides Merida�۪s hair under a wimple. (Merida promptly pulls out a wavy lock so that it springs across her forehead defiantly wagging nyah nyah like a tongue.) The tussling between Elinor and Merida is familiar but while the mother-daughter clashes may make the story ���relatable �۝ they drain it of its mythopoetic potential turning what could have been a cool postmodern fairy tale into another family melodrama. Part of Pixar�۪s genius has been how it uses fanciful facsimiles of the real world to retool myths including that of the voyaging hero (���Finding Nemo�۝ and so on). Merida ends up with a quest too but because she�۪s female and to the throne born she also comes with some tricky princess baggage notably the queen." Elinor isn�۪t a classic villainess ��� she�۪s motivated by clan tradition rather than that great feminine evil: vanity. Yet she effectively performs the same instigating role pushing the story and her daughter forward. In many respects Elinor is the most complex character in ���Brave �۝ mostly because the filmmakers come across as seriously conflicted about her presenting her as a model of dignified queenly restraint then as a killjoy intent on dampening her daughter and husband�۪s joy ��� she steps on Fergus�۪s lines and clucks at his raucous boys-will-be-boys merriment ��� and finally as a comically unnatural figure of ladylike propriety. (She can be oddly oblivious to her tiny troublemaking sons a trio who bounce around like the Ritz Brothers.)" trying to comfort Elinor suggests that they engage in role playing with him pretending to be Merida. ���I don�۪t want to get married �۝ he announces in falsetto. ���I want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind as I ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset.�۝ Sounds good to me! It�۪s the funniest bit in the movie but also mean and disappointingly telling. Merida doesn�۪t dream that her prince will come; she doesn�۪t have to because it�۪s clear that within the logic of the movie the alternative is comically unthinkable. It�۪s no great surprise that she wins the struggle to determine her fate. But hers is a contingent freedom won with smiles acquiescence and a literal needle and thread with which she neatly sews up the story repairing a world where girls and women know exactly where they stand."

a big-screen version of Seth Grahame-Smith�۪s comic novel was doubtless inevitable given the delectable absurdity of the 16th president of the United States�۪ going all Buffy on a vamp army splitting heads like rails. That sounds funny and for a while it plays like head-exploding gangbusters on screen particularly when the young Mr. Lincoln (a solid Benjamin Walker) in his grasshopper stage begins learning how to swing a silver-tipped ax like a kung fu master. (As the great man said: ���Whatever you are be a good one.�۝)" but these days anything goes when it comes to monsters. The newfangled vampires in ���Abraham Lincoln�۝ are largely felled with silver-tipped blades and like the dead beauties in the ���Twilight�۝ movies (and the original ���Dracula�۝) they also move about during the day. What really distinguishes them though is less their sun screen than a monstrosity that isn�۪t simply a matter of myth or the metaphysical anguish that can trouble a modern vampire. Rather theirs is a historical evil: These vampires are white Southerners whose cause is the enslavement of human beings and not states�۪ rights. There�۪s no denying their villainy a welcome alternative to those real-world celebrations that whitewash the period by ignoring slavery." the movie opens in 1820 with Abraham as a young boy proving his moral mettle by protecting another child a black friend Will (Anthony Mackie takes over the thankless adult role) from a slaver�۪s whip. The slaver is Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) who takes his revenge on Abraham by lethally nibbling Abe�۪s mother Nancy. She�۪s soon out of the picture as is his father. This clears the way for the orphan�۪s revenge a life mission that by the time Lincoln is tall enough to skim ceilings has transformed him into a warrior whose skills are more 20th century than 19th more reminiscent of the slow-motion cool of early Wachowski brothers than the slow-literature adventures of the earlier era." the story zips from Lincoln�۪s childhood to young adulthood where after a botched vampire hunt he meets an agreeable enigma Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Henry teaches Abraham the Way of the Vampire Kill an extended enjoyable lesson that allows the performers to engage with each other rather than serving as props like most of the actors here. Once Henry leaves the scene the movie quickly deflates both because Mr. Cooper isn�۪t around to fan your interest and because the story�۪s fealty to its pulpy version of history (Mary Todd etc.) drags it down. Once Abraham grows a beard laying down his ax to take up politics the movie is effectively over if not done. And the Civil War has scarcely begun." slo-mo action it�۪s clear that the Russian director Timur Bekmambetov still holds ���The Matrix�۝ close to his heart. He first popped up on American radar with a pair of supernatural diversions ���Night Watch�۝ (2004) and ���Day Watch�۝ (2006) that are close to incomprehensible (I became bored trying) but are crammed with enough gloom and pyrotechnics that he soon went Hollywood. His first American studio effort ���Wanted�۝ (2008) is a modestly diverting if finally tedious exercise in which the stylized violence almost upstages its star Angelina Jolie. ���Wanted�۝ is the kind of contemporary studio fun that shows a bullet exiting a human head in slow motion giving you time to marvel at how the skin around the wound stretches as the projectile leisurely rips through the skull." �۝ which gives him untold bodies with which to paint the screen red. (The intentionally drab at times duo-chromatic palette dulls the colorful spray.) Outside of Nazis and zombies or better yet Nazi zombies nothing says easily disposable villains like slave-trading vampires. And there is no question something satisfying ��� as the pleasure of the story�۪s pop conceit hits your deep historical outrage ��� about watching Lincoln decapitate a slave-trading ghoul at least the first few dozen times. If only Mr. Bekmambetov had a strong sense of narrative rhythm and proportion and as great a commitment to life as he does to death and all the ways bodies can be digitally pulverized."

Prashant Bhargava�۪s first feature has a lovely unforced quality. That�۪s because Mr. Bhargava lets his story set during the annual kite festival in Ahmedabad India tell itself unfolding slowly as he follows filmmaking�۪s most basic and most sinned-against dictum: Show don�۪t tell." a Delhi businessman returns home with his daughter Priya (Sugandha Garg) to Ahmedabad in Gujarat for the kite festival. They stay at the family mansion a picturesquely crumbling pile presided over by Jayesh�۪s sister-in-law (the excellent Seema Biswas). It�۪s deep in the old city a place of narrow alleys wandering livestock and tiered rooftops where residents gather to fly kites and picnic on the festival day." not least the sense that the camera is capturing unguarded moments.

his angular features slicing across the screen is one reason to see ���The Woman in the Fifth.�۝ Another is that this psychological thriller (or perhaps psychothriller) about an American writer down on his luck in Paris and maybe out of his mind creates a sense of dread that builds and builds though never resolves even in the final fade out. It doesn�۪t have the kind of payoff that details who did what and why which is a problem only if you demand tidy endings. If you�۪re up for some narrative drift you can just go with the ambiguous flow created by the Polish-born filmmaker Pawel Pawlikowski who I suspect is a fan of Antonioni�۪s ���Passenger.�۝" the film turns on Tom Ricks an American novelist and professor who arrives in Paris with a suitcase in hand and his future in doubt. He�۪s come to settle in France he tells an officer at the airport and has a French wife and a daughter. This isn�۪t precisely true: Tom is divorced from his wife Nathalie (Delphine Chuillot) for starters. More important from the fearful look in her eyes when they meet and the uncomprehending look in his ��� even when she says ���You�۪re not normal�۝ ��� his desire to settle seems chimerical. Minutes later police sirens are wailing and he�۪s racing down the street." a marginal stretch of block buildings and derelict streets. There at a cafe where Arabic music wafts out of the speakers and darker-complexioned men sip drinks he talks his way into a squalid room for rent despite having no money." but it doesn�۪t take long to realize that it isn�۪t the cafe denizens who are troubling the air. It�۪s Tom." Mr. Pawlikowski adds dissonance to the audio track and narrows the world that Tom inhabits by playing with both the physical spaces and depth of field. At first Tom�۪s movements are limited because he�۪s broke (and broken) and wants to stay near his daughter. Forbidden from contacting her by a court order he watches her play in a park sleeps in his room writes in the cafe. He�۪s hemmed in by circumstances and by cramped spaces that feel like manifestations of his being. Mr. Hawke hunched almost caved in makes the character�۪s isolation palpable. Meanwhile Mr. Pawlikowski expresses this alienation visually as at a party where surrounded by strangers Tom talks to a woman he sees only as a literal blur." an enigma with an ���exotic�۝ accent (and a flat in the Fifth) who slinks up to Tom lights a cigarette and announces that she was her husband�۪s translator and muse. Muse? Is she for real or a delusion?" insisting on a seriousness that the actors wrap themselves in like a mantle. At moments it feels as if Mr. Pawlikowski were inching into early Roman Polanski territory somewhere along the horror-comic lines of ���The Tenant.�۝ Yet while Mr. Pawlikowski plays his character�۪s subjective point of view against the so-called objective reality forcing you to wonder which is ���true �۝ as Mr. Polanski does he does so without the lacerating self-aware sense of the absurd." Tom is pulled into Margit�۪s strange cosseted world even as he begins spending time with a pretty Polish woman Ania (Joanna Kulig) who inexplicably works at the cafe. He�۪s also hired by the cafe owner Sezer (Samir Guesmi) to sit in a bunkerlike room where each night Tom watches a closed-circuit television and admits strangers who bang on an exterior door. Like many of the film�۪s spaces this room with a sizzling light bulb straight out of a David Lynch hallucination registers as an externalization of Tom�۪s tortured mind." the actor draws you close. There�۪s anguish in Tom�۪s face that speaks of a terrible fragility and that leavens the story�۪s mysterioso proceedings with a real recognizable humanity."

�۝ especially some crisp martial arts fight sequences and the subtle sense of humor that surfaces now and then. But the filmmakers make a mistake in telling the story via flashback and a voice-over by Jason Yee who plays Jake the main character. As graceful as Mr. Yee is in those fights he proves that delivering a compelling voice-over is harder than it seems." but Jake mostly sounds awkward talking us through his efforts to avenge the killing of Sandy (Samantha Streets) an under-age prostitute for whom he developed a soft spot while working as her driver. Jake took that job to pay off a foolishly incurred debt and it puts him in the midst of an underworld centered on a club called the Naked Eye where men connect with escorts like Sandy." Mr. Yee makes a pretty good vigilante and the script (written by Mr. Yee; David Ren who directed; and Larry Madill) features some unconventional choices that give the film a distinct personality. The chief villain ought to be a man named Simon who books Sandy and the other women but Ron Yuan plays him with a likability that keeps things refreshingly off-kilter. Mr. Yuan also directed the fight sequences. One of those staged in a narrow hallway is a particular gem."

�۝ a jukebox musical turned junky big-screen attraction about making it in the music biz back when it still existed is just entertaining enough to keep you from dark thoughts about the state of Hollywood. The movie is too insipid for such hand wringing in any event and the attention-grabbing turns by Alec Baldwin Russell Brand and especially Tom Cruise as a rock-star crazy help enliven its overlong two hours. All singing some dancing the movie brings to mind ���Glee �۝ but its truer superior progenitor is that 1933 Cinderella story ���42nd Street �۝ the one in which the producer tells the chorine ���You�۪re going out a youngster but you�۪ve got to come back a star!�۝" who early on meet cute on the Sunset Strip that asphalt ribbon distinguished by its clubs eateries high hopes low prospects and celebrity deaths that winds through West Hollywood. She�۪s a little bit country newly arrived from Flyover U.S.A.; he�۪s a little bit hair-metal with a menial gig at the Bourbon Room and dreams of guitar-rock divinity. The make-believe Bourbon sits next to the Whisky a Go Go although in reality it and the rest of the conspicuously faked Strip were shot in a tricked-out neighborhood in Miami. Mostly though the whole thing rests on a er bedrock of clich̩s from Hollywood�۪s favorite genre: movies about itself." �۝ directed by the former dancer and choreographer Adam Shankman is based on a musical ��� nicely described by Lina Lecaro a Los Angeles scenester as a ���headbangin�۪-to-the-oldies revue�۝ ��� that originated in a Hollywood club in 2005 and eventually migrated to Broadway where it continues to pull in fans at the Helen Hayes. (Mr. Shankman directed the 2007 movie ���Hairspray �۝ which was based on the Broadway musical that was in another testament to entertainment industry self-cannibalization based on the 1988 John Waters film.) Like the musical the movie ���Rock of Ages�۝ is set in 1987 the year that ���Appetite for Destruction �۝ the first album from Guns N�۪ Roses and Tipper Gore�۪s book ���Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society �۝ both hit the cultural fray." Chris D�۪Arienzo (who wrote the original show) and Allan Loeb the movie resurrects these two forgotten events through a pair of opponents: an Axl Rose-like rocker Stacee Jaxx played with uncharacteristic heat and an undulating bare torso by Mr. Cruise and a crusading neo-Puritan Patricia Whitmore energetically embodied by an underused Catherine Zeta-Jones. Whitmore has vowed as part of the campaign to have her husband Mike (Bryan Cranston) elected mayor to clean up the Strip. In actuality it was Prince�۪s album ���Purple Rain�۝ that triggered Ms. Gore�۪s outrage over rock �۪n�۪ raunch an indignation that led to the Parents Music Resource Center Senate hearings about dirty minds and government regulation and eventually her wider pop-cultural attacks. Bringing in Prince would have made the movie listenable but it would have complicated its white-bread world." which debatably reflects that of the music milieu it seeks to replicate. (Mary J. Blige as Justice the owner of a strip club and the character actor Angelo Donato Valderrama as a club busboy named Chico are among the movie�۪s few tokens of diversity.) Rather this Wonder Bread banality comes from how thoroughly Mr. Shankman has vacuumed his rock-scene simulacrum of anything recognizably rock including the lust juice heat bad behavior and excesses that characterize its real-life analogue. There isn�۪t any grit to these people or their art not a speck of dirt anywhere. It looks like Disneyland and sounds well like a bad Broadway musical with all the power belting and jazz-hand choreography that implies." there�۪s way too much Journey on the soundtrack and Foreigner. There�۪s also an REO Speedwagon ditty a few from Twisted Sister Def Leppard and Poison and at least two hits that were released after 1987 (���More Than Words�۝ and ���I Remember You�۝). All the songs are sung mostly without shame or distinction by the actors themselves who slide into the warbling as if into a conversation. A grizzled bewigged Mr. Baldwin enunciates through his songs in the Rex Harrison mold to play a rock survivor Dennis Dupree who runs the Bourbon with his sidekick Lonny (Mr. Brand). They make their stale buddy routine and romance amusing and as with the rest of the adults make the movie bearable. A whispering and writhing Mr. Cruise makes it watchable." few drugs some rock �۪n�۪ roll."

Jack (Mark Duplass) is a variation on the dominant axiom of modern American film comedy ��� the nice thirtyish guy with soft features slack ambitions and a knack for self-deprecation. He comes equipped with a battered bicycle a bunch of vintage-y T-shirts and an aura of suffering that is the result of his brother�۪s death a year earlier. We learn a bit about the brother whose name was Tom but not much about Jack. About an hour into the movie a colleague of mine leaned over and whispered ���What�۪s his job?�۝" which I suppose could have been inferred. The point is that a certain contextual fuzziness pervades the film which takes place over a few days in and around a vacation house on an island off the coast of Washington State. Jack has been sent there by Iris whose job is related to photography or fashion and who used to be Tom�۪s girlfriend. But there is something indistinct about her too even though she is played by the effortlessly vivid Emily Blunt. And Iris�۪s sister Hannah indelibly incarnated by the graceful strong-jawed Rosemarie DeWitt (Rachel in ���Rachel Getting Married�۝) is a bit of a cipher too. The basic data on Hannah is that she is a vegan and that she has just walked away from a tumultuous long-term lesbian relationship." really should we care? I have been suggesting that the backgrounds of the characters are left blank but it may be more accurate to say that they are taken for granted and assumed not to matter. There is no reason to be curious about their ambitions their childhoods or their relationship to money partly because they are not especially curious about anything beyond their own feelings. You could call ���Your Sister�۪s Sister�۝ a group portrait of youthful solipsists in an era of economic contraction and social malaise but that wouldn�۪t be quite right. Self-absorption is not the subject; it is the paint." intermittently delightful to contemplate. Mr. Duplass (the writer and director with his brother Jay of films like ���Baghead �۝ ���Cyrus�۝ and ���Jeff Who Lives at Home�۝) is good at playing funny and sensitive without overdoing either quality. When Jack and Hannah both of whom were expecting to have the house to themselves meet by surprise there the resulting encounter ��� cautious flirtatious and increasingly drunken ��� is at once entirely believable and wildly uncomfortably funny." things get even more awkward and Ms. Shelton lingers over an emerging triangle of secrets miscommunications and jealousies. Nothing much happens ��� food is cooked coffee is drunk jokes are cracked eyes are rolled ��� and the loose vagabond rhythm makes ���Your Sister�۪s Sister�۝ feel a bit like a French movie immersed in personalities rather than driven by the machinery of plot." shallow tears and a coy trick ending.

���UFO in Her Eyes�۝ ��� is a quiet agricultural hamlet in the Guangxi province of southern China that is uprooted by instant globalization. The catalyst is a sighting by Kwok Yun (Shi Ke) an unmarried peasant in her 30s of what she believes is a U.F.O." Kwok Yun gazes through it and is stunned by a blinding white light. Moments later she meets a Caucasian man (Udo Kier) suffering from a snake bite. She delivers first aid; then he mysteriously disappears." she reports having seen an extraterrestrial object that resembled a dumpling. For helping the stranger she is roundly scolded because the village is hostile to outsiders." accompanied by a $3 000 check. Chief Chang (Mandy Zhang) the avaricious Communist mayor who quotes Mao Zedong goes haywire with dreams of parlaying the windfall into untold riches. Kwok Yun is given an award for being ���a model peasant�۝ and is relieved of working in the mine where she has been toiling. As word spreads of the U.F.O. the world descends on the xenophobic village." �۝ adapted from a novel by Ms. Guo is a surreal fantasy there is little explanation for how Three-Headed Bird Village is transformed almost overnight into a tacky tourist attraction with a U.F.O. theme park hotel and golf course. The story is told in interwoven color and black-and-white segments." condescending Chinese bureaucrat dispatched from Beijing to interview the residents. He is heard asking questions but his face is never shown." which include ���believe in yourself �۝ ���only invest other people�۪s money �۝ and ���the packaging is more important than the product.�۝ Without knowing exactly what they�۪re consuming the children go around reading the dirty parts of Henry Miller�۪s ���Tropic of Cancer.�۝ (The village is at that latitude.)" when applied to Chinese capitalism wreak havoc once the initial euphoria subsides. The new golf course claims valuable farmland. The local butcher is told he cannot operate without refrigeration. Kwok Yun�۪s shack is torn down. And during a grotesque drunken celebration when the foreigner returns to participate in a flag-waving orgy of self-congratulation the dispossessed peasants rise up." whose character is supposed to be American is a well-known German actor his accent is discordant but no matter. The movie scores its satirical point about the irresistibility ��� at least for these na��ve peasants ��� of the silliest aspects of capitalist development.

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/movies/marina-abramovic-the-artist-is-present-a-documentary-on-her-life.html
�۝ the centerpiece of an identically named 2010 retrospective of work by the performance artist Marina Abramovic at the Museum of Modern Art in New York was one of those rare events that breach the wall dividing the art world from popular culture. Over 90 days ��� from the beginning of March through the end of May ��� hundreds of thousands of people streamed through MoMA lining up (sometimes after camping out on 53rd Street the night before) for the opportunity to see Ms. Abramovic face to face. She sat in a plain wooden chair gazing straight ahead silently into the eyes of whichever museum patron happened to be seated across from her." as recorded by Matthew Akers in his documentary ���Marina Abramovic the Artist Is Present �۝ was galvanic. Many spectators cried during their encounter with Ms. Abramovic and tears could often be seen in her eyes as well. The film which begins a two-week run at Film Forum on Wednesday in advance of its premiere on HBO next month traces the genesis of that work and also provides through interviews and archival clips an overview of Ms. Abramovic�۪s career. Like many other recent documentaries about artists it is more celebratory than analytical a kind of slick extended promotional video for its subject." though an artist as provocative and charismatic as Ms. Abramovic might have been better served by at least a bit of contention. A hint of skepticism flutters in via television news reports hyperventilating about the presence of naked people at the museum ��� performers recreating some of Ms. Abramovic�۪s earlier pieces ��� but the filmmakers are disinclined to seek out critical voices or to dig too deeply into the thorny issues of sex violence and identity raised by her work." granted access to her at home in the studio and even in the bathtub they bask in her formidable aura and invite viewers to do the same. Tall and striking with long black hair and features that suggest an archaic Greek sculpture Ms. Abramovic is an eloquent and passionate explicator of her art and the experiences that informed it. The child of anti-Fascist partisans who were national heroes in Tito�۪s Yugoslavia she joined the European avant-garde of the 1960s and �۪70s and gained a measure of fame for the fearless sometimes violent way she used her own body in her performances." ���Marina Abramovic the Artist Is Present�۝ collects testimony from art historians dealers and curators notably Klaus Biesenbach the enthusiastic impresario of the MoMA show who likens working with Ms. Abramovic to a love affair. And an actual love story is embedded within the film�۪s summary of her life. In the 1970s and �۪80s she and the German performance artist Frank Uwe Laysiepen known as Ulay were lovers and artistic collaborators a partnership that is narrated by both of them. Captured in occasionally haunting images it suggests a great unwritten novel of creative passion and romantic disillusionment." gray-bearded Ulay is the most vivid supporting player in ���The Artist Is Present �۝ and his reunion with Ms. Abramovic is touching and sweet. But the emotional power and finally the aesthetic interest of the film reside in its attention to the work that provides its title and its reason for being. The daily spectacle of Ms. Abramovic in her chair at MoMA is brought back in all its strangeness and excitement and you also catch a glimpse of the logistical challenges involved in staging something at once so simple and so radical. (The patience and professionalism of the museum�۪s security guards are one of the film�۪s unstated themes.)" but a stronger case is made by the rapt and tearful faces of the museumgoers who sat facing her in Manhattan two years ago. The film�۪s message can be summed up in a familiar phrase: You had to be there."

sleeping in a bedroom full of action figures movie posters and other emblems of interminable childhood. In other words he is in the context of recent American cinema not unusual. But ���Dark Horse�۝ is a Todd Solondz movie which means among other things that Abe is neither a sweet Apatovian schlub nor a stoner saint like the title character in Mark and Jay Duplass�۪s ���Jeff Who Lives at Home.�۝ He is instead an emblem of loneliness and failure whose cocoon of self-delusion and misplaced vanity is carefully dismantled by the sharp remorseless tweezers of Mr. Solondz�۪s sensibility." humorless dad played by Christopher Walken and a simpering smothering mom played by Mia Farrow ��� he whines and rages his way through daily storms of entitled petulance. Abe works for his father a real estate developer or at least spends time at the office seething and daydreaming behind his computer screen while Marie the office manager (Donna Murphy) covers for him and his eager cousin curries favor with the boss. The bright yellow Hummer Abe drives is an obvious symbol of his wounded bloated ego. His courtship of Miranda (Selma Blair) a mopey young woman who also lives at home in a state of arrested medicated quasi-adolescence is frequently excruciating to watch because it exposes just how misplaced and bizarre his self-confidence is. What a jerk you can�۪t help but conclude. What a loser. Why doesn�۪t he know it?" transforming what might have been an exercise in easy satirical cruelty into a tremendously moving argument for the necessity of compassion. Again and again ��� in the �۪90s indie touchstones ���Welcome to the Dollhouse�۝ and ���Happiness �۝ and more recently in ���Life During Wartime�۝ ��� this director has blurred the boundary between misanthropy and humanism. He surveys the human geography of his native suburbia with what looks like unbridled disgust but is actually an unquenchable and steadfast love. ���Dark Horse�۝ may be his warmest most generous movie but it also casts a beam of empathy backward illuminating the baffled benighted icky souls who have populated Mr. Solondz�۪s universe from the start." life-and-death questions and Mr. Solondz refuses to make them easy. He favors lurid borderline-ugly colors and finds a tone that somehow erases the distinction between deadpan comedy and overwrought melodrama. His eye for social detail is merciless and exact. Miranda and Abe�۪s families are by any objective demographic measure nearly identical but the tiny differences that separate them evident in the architecture and d̩cor of their respective houses imply an unbridgeable chasm of taste. Those differences are further explored in an encounter between Abe and Mahmoud (Aasif Mandvi) Miranda�۪s supercilious ostentatiously cosmopolitan ex-boyfriend. This guy thinks he�۪s so much better than Abe and the joke is that the feeling is entirely mutual. It has to be since in this world you are nobody unless you are better than somebody else. And if you aren�۪t then you better be able to find someone to blame." his mother�۪s softness the apparently effortless success of his younger brother Richard (Justin Bartha) a doctor ��� all of these are elements in what Abe sees as a global conspiracy to keep him down. The title ���Dark Horse �۝ refers to his idea of himself as one of life�۪s secret winners preparing a glorious come-from-behind victory that will be his revenge on all the people who have dared to underestimate him." increasing their frequency until the end of the movie becomes a Bu̱uelian cascade of dreams within dreams. (The film culminates in one of the most eloquent heartbreaking shots I have seen in a very long time.) But the film�۪s purpose is not to revel in Abe�۪s disillusionment or ridicule his longings. It aims instead to cast a skeptical eye on the brutality and complacency of a society that ruthlessly sorts its members into winners and losers." I saw the shadow of Willy Loman. This may just be because Broadway�۪s latest Willy was Philip Seymour Hoffman who was so indelibly creepy in ���Happiness.�۝ ���Dark Horse�۝ and ���Death of a Salesman�۝ are both stories of a family (implicitly Jewish) with a mother father and two boys in the thrall of ��� and threatened by ��� the American dream. The theme of both stories is the ideology of success and its casualties; the ways the expectation of material comfort becomes a spiritual quest and a psychological hazard. Mr. Solondz�۪s film is on the surface a comedy preferring quick barbed exchanges to thundering speeches. But like ���Salesman �۝ its departures from realism have the effect of enlarging the narrow unremarkable lives that are its focus and by extension the audience�۪s sense of what those lives might mean. Attention ��� tentative half-repulsed hopelessly ambivalent ��� must be paid."

Harnessing a selection of scientists residents and environmental experts the director Brian Lilla openly aligns himself with the proposal�۪s detractors cleverly situating his film within a larger attack on the global embrace of dams and their devastating impact on aquatic ecosystems. Though the paucity of enthusiastic supporters ��� limited here to a few small-business owners and the project�۪s general manager ��� may suggest filmmaker bias street interviews in Santiago reveal an astonishingly uninformed citizenry that the news media and public officials seem unable or unwilling to address." as well as to hammer home the crucial distinction between renewable and sustainable energy. But the film�۪s forest of facts and talking heads while satisfying the intellect fails to stir the emotions; so it�۪s almost a relief to escape to the isolated farms of the region�۪s leathery gauchos where breathtaking landscape shots honor a way of life in imminent danger of being quite literally swept away.

The gamut is represented from the wanton Kyle (Anthony Burrell) to the innocent Sebastian (Blake Young-Fountain)." whose story line ends up being most compelling has somehow made it through Brown not only as a virgin but also not knowing the basics of how to have gay sex. This provides the excuse for what should be a funny scene in which that is explained to him in minute detail but Mr. Polk can�۪t find the right comic tone. It becomes one of several spots where the movie turns didactic and they all have the feel of those old government public service films about venereal disease.

From a commercial standpoint this is more than a little risky encouraging nonplused critics to dust off the ���experimental�۝ tag that sends most moviegoers running for the hills. Yet this first feature from Calvin Lee Reeder (who also wrote the story such as it is) doesn�۪t feel like an experiment; it feels like a journey whose destination was firmly predetermined." so let your brain off the hook and surrender to a sensual experience that�۪s the opposite of ingratiating. From the moment our unnamed heroine (Lindsay Pulsipher) awakens in a wrecked car on a deserted country road we are plunged inside her head: a jangled soundscape of twanging guitars and partly tuned radio stations heavy breathing and desperate screams. Bloodied and bedeviled by random flashes of white light the young woman staggers off in search of help her progress marked by increasingly odd encounters: a crone flashing a dead smile; a weirdo wearing a green plushy costume. Is she a victim of concussion? Or just too many Luis Bu̱uel movies?" silly startling irritating and black-vomit-and-multicolored-urine disgusting ���The Oregonian�۝ wears out its welcome within 30 minutes.

The book a kind of space age ���Da Vinci Code �۝ inspired a goofy German documentary and if memory serves some earnest anxious debates among sixth-grade protogeeks who shall remain nameless." �۝ which arrived at the decade�۪s end had a far more durable impact. If you saw it in a theater at an impressionable age you may still be seized by irrational mortal fear every time you experience a touch of indigestion. A powerful perfect blend of the space-travel and horror genres ���Alien�۝ tapped into a deep claustrophobic anxiety and an equally primal sense of adventure the simultaneous thrill and terror of the unknown. The sinewy resilience of Sigourney Weaver�۪s Ripley and the designs of the Swiss graphic artist H. R. Giger ��� including various horrible manifestations of the alien itself ��� have been etched into the pop-cultural DNA ever since." ���Prometheus �۝ Mr. Scott returning to science fiction after a 30-year post-���Blade Runner�۝ absence entwines the visceral creatural dread of ���Alien�۝ with some of the quasi-mythic grandiosity of ���Chariots.�۝ Once again a vessel lumbers through the galactic void and a diverse crew must contend with menacing weirdness outside the ship and growing paranoia within it. The Giger alien may still be out there. Something wicked lurks in subterranean tunnels their walls etched in freaky runes. And hovering over all the scary stuff are some big metaphysical questions about the origin and ultimate fate of humanity." some disappointment sets in. But Mr. Scott�۪s sense of visual scale which has often produced hectic hectoring grandiosity (are you not entertained?) achieves especially in the first hour something like genuine grandeur. Twinned opening scenes ��� the first involving a giant alabaster-skinned biped sacrificing himself to propagate life on Earth and the second thousands of years later devoted to scientists�۪ finding traces of his presences ��� impart a palpable sense of awe. The music by Marc Streitenfeld soars and rumbles toward cosmic significance. And the shudders of sublimity only grow more intense as Mr. Scott elegantly lays out a series of overlapping conceits." but the amazing thing is that at least for a while they don�۪t feel that way. The visual scheme is sufficiently captivating and most of the performances are subtle enough that whatever skepticism you may arrive with quickly turns into happy disorientation. The 3-D is unusually graceful ��� your gaze is absorbed rather than assaulted ��� and you are pulled into a world of lovely and disconcerting strangeness with plenty of time to puzzle over the behavior of its inhabitants." an android played with silken wit by Michael Fassbender. The sentient sensitive possibly treacherous robot is hardly a novelty in this kind of movie and David is partly a collage of cinematic allusions. His name and his air of innocence recall the mechanical boy hero of Steven Spielberg�۪s ���A.

His boss representing obscure but undoubtedly sinister corporate interests is Charlize Theron who is doing everything she can (in this movie and in ���Snow White & the Huntsman�۝) to make this an icy June at the movies." Mr. Scott likes to throw a few clownish expendable rustics into his ensembles though in this case the designated buffoons are bickering scientists played by Rafe Spall and Sean Harris. Tradition dictates that there also be among all this compromised agenda-driven humanity a paragon of decency and idealism under duress. This would be Elizabeth Shaw ��� Dr. Who fans take note: Your bases have been covered too ��� a researcher played by Noomi Rapace. Along with her husband Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) Shaw regards the voyage of the Prometheus as a spiritual quest. The child of missionaries (glimpsed in flashback) she wears a cross and speaks sincerely and literally about going to meet her maker." the girl with the dragon tattoo in the Swedish film adaptations of the Stieg Larsson trilogy is a fine heroine vulnerable and determined. Her physique and features suggest a Hello Kitty version of Ms. Weaver�۪s Ripley though as in the ���Dragon Tattoo�۝ movies her pixieishness is accompanied by superhuman endurance. This is evident above all in a scene of self-inflicted surgery capable of reducing a packed rowdy theater to stunned appalled almost reverent silence." but ���Prometheus�۝ kind of spoils itself with twists and reversals that pull the movie away from its lofty mind-blowing potential. Geeks and dreamers will hold onto scraps of splendor and wish for more.

The rift began after Grace sold pot at her daughter�۪s wedding. (She still deals discreetly.)" Love & Misunderstanding �۝ directed by Bruce Beresford from a screenplay by Christina Mengert and Joseph Muszynski is stylistically a formulaic middle-drawer television movie about intergenerational strife and forgiveness. Every plot turn is groaningly predictable. But at least the lead performances set off sparks."

If the movie is frustratingly coy about Diane�۪s political views in personal matters she is a snippy prude still infuriated by Grace�۪s noisy promiscuity while she was growing up. It�۪s conceivable that the muddy circumstances of her birth may have contributed to her sourness. Grace who insists on calling Diane by the more mythical-sounding Diana likes to say that her water broke during Jimi Hendrix�۪s Woodstock performance of ���The Star Spangled Banner.�۝" Love & Misunderstanding�۝ makes no bones about where its loyalties lie. It is on the side of those still-swinging elders of which Ms. Fonda is a proud living example. But the generational roles have reversed. In the good old days it was defiant free-spirited kids who liberated the uptight grown-ups with sex drugs and rock �۪n�۪ roll. Forty years later it is the kids who need liberating by the same baby boomers who are as cheerfully self-righteous as ever about their hedonism.

affectionate portrait of a young woman in crisis. As her 30th birthday approaches Lola (Greta Gerwig) a graduate student living in New York is dumped by her fianc̩ Luke (Joel Kinnaman). The shock waves of this catastrophe reverberate through the rest of the movie directed by Daryl Wein from a script he wrote with Zoe Lister-Jones." a couple in real life previously collaborated on ���Breaking Upwards�۝ a fresh and honest look at the difficulties of sustaining a relationship in the post-post-sexual-revolution world. ���Lola Versus �۝ unfortunately is a dismayingly conventional exploration of the vicissitudes of romance. In spite of its scruffy look and slack pacing it often rings as false as any of the big shiny and soft studio rom-coms (starring Kate Hudson or Katherine Heigl say) of the last decade." Alice (Ms. Lister-Jones) who bemoans her perpetually single state and is a walking anthology of semi-naughty quips pop culture non-sequiturs and questionable behaviors. She spray tans. She takes OxyContin mistaking it for oxytocin which she thinks will be a shortcut to orgasm. It�۪s actually somehow less funny than it sounds." a skinny sensitive guy who plays in a band and who is also awkwardly good friends with Luke. Luke meanwhile is still sort of around unwilling to let go of Lola entirely and thus feeding her longing to get back together with him." complicated emotions implicit in the story and Ms. Gerwig with her guileless smarts and agreeable openness makes a game effort at exploring them. She is good at crying good at playing drunk good at bad sex and good at a lot of more particular things like fidgeting on a yoga mat and talking knowledgeably about the poetry of St̩phane Mallarm̩. And as far as I�۪m concerned any movie with room for both Mallarm̩ and Ms. Gerwig is not to be despised entirely." though even to the point of annoyance. In addition to her pals Lola has mostly supportive parents (Debra Winger and Bill Pullman) who genially represent a vaguely defined older generation. The present generation is equally fuzzy or rather composed of familiar off-the-rack styles and references. I think I mentioned the yoga but there also is a food truck and a series of kind-of-ironic riffs on stuff like ���Beverly Hills 90210�۝ and ���The Godfather.�۝" it somehow makes New York feel dinky and contrived like a lesser Austin Tex. or a standing set on a studio backlot made up to look like Hipstertown." but in the season of ���Girls�۝ a secondhand sentimental sex comedy however well-meaning is not going to cut it.

the coldblooded social climber who seduces his way to the top of Gallic society in Guy de Maupassant�۪s 1885 novel ���Bel Ami �۝ is one of the nastiest pieces of work in French literature. But Robert Pattinson who plays Georges in the novel�۪s latest English-language adaptation seems stuck in the land of ���Twilight.�۝ Lowering your gaze and flashing a vampirish glare is not acting it�۪s making faces." �۝ the 1947 version starring George Sanders. An example of what might have been is the great but nearly forgotten 1968 television mini-series ���Nana �۝ based on the ��mile Zola novel from the same period. The homme fatal of ���Bel Ami�۝ is a male version of Zola�۪s man-eating prostitute. In his ruthless amorality he is also a descendant of the Vicomte de Valmont in ���Les Liaisons Dangereuses �۝ but with an added layer of cruelty." as if he had just been practicing in a mirror the primary missing ingredient is charm. This reasonably good-looking 26-year-old English actor with his asymmetrical eyes and a doughy torso affects a cold reptilian sneer. Bad boys may have their appeal but this one lacks the animal magnetism of even an amateur Lothario. To watch Christina Ricci Uma Thurman and Kristin Scott Thomas melt under his icy ministrations is to roll your eyes in disbelief." �۝ directed by Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod from a screenplay by Rachel Bennette is so skimpy in its character development and social observation that it plays like a lavishly illustrated outline that leaves you to fill in the blanks." who comes from an impoverished Normandy farming family is introduced into society by Charles Forestier (Philip Glenister) an old army buddy from their days in Morocco who is an editor at La Vie Fran̤aise a powerful newspaper." Madeleine (Ms. Thurman) helps Georges get a job at the paper by writing his first article for him. She also gives him a tip: ���The most important people in Paris aren�۪t the men but their wives.�۝ When she refuses to sleep with him he seduces her married friend Clotilde (Ms. Ricci) who purchases a ���love nest�۝ for them. Charles dies and Georges pounces on Madeleine and marries her then zeros in on Virginie Rousset (Ms. Scott Thomas) the wife of the newspaper�۪s top editor (Colm Meaney). After a single night with Georges Virginie becomes his clinging besotted doormat cooing ���my beautiful boy�۝ to her transparently disgusted seducer." whose lust is exceeded only by his avarice. Although this is potentially juicy stuff it is as dry and tasteless as a shrunken piece of fruit left in the refrigerator far too long." and Georges unleashes a sustained howl of fury late in the movie about the grinding poverty that turned him into a monster. But these isolated soliloquies can�۪t begin to compensate for all that�۪s missing." �۝ in Charles�۪s words is all the sadder because the parallels between the dawn of the Belle ��poque and our now-fading gilded age are so obvious."

The film just about an hour long and directed by the French animation team of Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol is also a refreshing reminder at a time of large-scale highly polished cinematic spectacle of the essential elemental sources of movie-watching pleasure." however digitally torqued and dimensionally expanded is essentially a bunch of drawings. The images in ���A Cat in Paris�۝ are pointedly and delightfully off-kilter and out of proportion. Feet are much too small for bodies. Perspectives shift and slide. Apparently solid objects have a tendency to wobble. The laws of physics are brazenly flouted as Mr. Felicioli and Mr. Gagnol take splendid advantage of the freedom that animation can offer to the hand the eye and the imagination." an attention to emotional nuance and narrative detail that make the film satisfying as well as charming. The cat Dino divides his time between two human companions. At night he is the accomplice to an honorable nimble thief named Nico. When morning comes he snuggles up with Zo̩ bringing her freshly killed lizards (and in one instance a freshly stolen bracelet) as tribute." Jeanne and is looked after by a suspiciously outgoing housekeeper. Jeanne is a police detective as was her husband killed in the line of duty by Victor Costa a criminal mastermind currently plotting a big-time art heist." Zo̩ has not spoken a word but her face ��� a minimal composition of a few lines and circles topped by a curve of orange hair ��� expresses all the feelings of a lonely sensitive child." Zo̩ is drawn into a wild and dangerous adventure that tests her resourcefulness and rewards her sound moral instincts. The plot has the pleasing complexity of a mechanical toy ��� the pieces click together nicely and the whole contraption zigzags according to its own whimsical logic ��� and the filmmakers find many opportunities for mildly surrealist visual invention." characters turn into chalk outlines on a black background. Fantasies occasionally take literal form as when Jeanne imagines her nemesis Costa as a giant red octopus." odd-angled buildings of Paris are lovingly rendered as are the gargoyles of Notre Dame who solemnly observe a climactic sequence of high-altitude score settling." and Dino�۪s murder of innocent lizards is celebrated rather than condemned ��� but they are also likely to be captivated by its elegant mixture of gravity and mischief." since there is very little of the noisy sentimental pandering that is too often a feature of kid-targeted entertainment nowadays.

swords and Charlize Theron�۪s hair ��� but there are actually some dwarfs in the new movie ���Snow White and the Huntsman.�۝ The small fellows who befriend the exiled princess here are nothing like the grumpy sneezy dopey guys you remember from the Disney version. The actors who play them (including Ian McShane Eddie Marsan Ray Winstone and the great Bob Hoskins all digitally shrunken) might otherwise have been assembled for a nasty little Cockney gangster film. These dwarfs are industrious but they don�۪t whistle while they work. Their most memorable song is a haunting dirge performed at the funeral pyre of a fallen comrade. So take note: There is nothing cute about this movie." like ���Snow White �۝ published by the Brothers Grimm in the early 19th century ��� emerged from the dark violent folk landscape of early modern Europe. They are fables of innocence but also of terror dense with superstition and sexual anxiety. Walt Disney�۪s justly beloved 1937 animated feature though it has some spooky gothic visual touches expelled most of the demons and turned the heroine into an emblem of chaste and cheerful domestic normalcy. Since then Hollywood fairy tales have mainly tacked between wide-eyed romanticism and winking self-consciousness." �۝ directed by the first-timer Rupert Sanders from a script by Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini tries something new. Or maybe something old even atavistic. Though it is an ambitious ��� at times mesmerizing ��� application of the latest cinematic technology the movie tries to recapture some of the menace of the stories that used to be told to scare children rather than console them. Its mythic-medieval landscapes are heavily shadowed and austere and its flights of magic are summoned from a zone of barely suppressed rage and dangerous power." Ms. Theron�۪s golden-haired furious queen. Having murdered the king on their wedding night and imprisoned his daughter in a tower Ravenna preens in front of her liquid-metal mirror plucks the hearts out of birds (with metal fingernail extensions apparently designed for that purpose) and terrorizes her subjects. She is loyally attended by her creepy brother Finn (Sam Spruell) ��� a kind of Dorian Gray portrait of his flawless sister the ugliness of whose soul seems inscribed on his leering pitted face ��� but otherwise alone in the castle of her cruelty." but Ravenna seems to be a woman with a legitimate grudge against a male-dominated world of sexual violence and patriarchal entitlement. With a slight shift of emphasis ���Snow White and the Huntsman�۝ might have been her story the tale of a victim turned righteous avenger. And it may be that being denied this status fuels Ravenna�۪s resentment. Her wrath is directed principally at other women: at the girls whose youth and beauty she steals to feed the spell that keeps her from aging and at the blameless princess who threatens her simply by being young and alive." of course played by Kristen Stewart at the precise point of intersection between action heroine and damsel in distress. Since Ms. Stewart has become thanks to ���Twilight �۝ the very embodiment of romantic indecision there are two possible suitors chivalrously circling her. Or two unshaven dudes at any rate vying to protect her and dividing the audience into Team Handsome Prince and Team Huntsman." a childhood friend of Snow�۪s and the son of a nobleman who has remained loyal to the memory of her father. He is a gifted archer and a dashing enough young man but there really is no contest. The movie is not called ���Snow White and William.�۝ The Huntsman a hard-drinking belligerent widower with no other name has the advantage of being played by Chris Hemsworth ��� Thor! ��� with sly gruff magnetism." and James Newton Howard�۪s score roars and howls like Wagner with a stubbed toe ��� the movie comes down to earth and springs to life when Mr. Hemsworth shows up. His huntsman like the dwarfs is a gruff human presence in a world that might otherwise have been too airily and abstractly fantastical." the roughness of those characters along with the scratchy earth tones of Greig Fraser�۪s cinematography make possible episodes of enchantment that feel fresh even to eyes that have seen everything under the digital sun. A terrifying slog through the dark forest a serene sojourn in the garden of the fairies a visit to an encampment of women and children ��� each of these scenes casts its own specific and effective spell." Dominic Watkins has done exceptional work ��� Ms. Theron is if not the fairest then surely the most striking one of all. She has a remarkable ability to mix coldness and sorrow and as the special effects etch lines on her face and then smooth them away she at once invites and refuses sympathy. Ravenna taught as a girl that beauty was the source of power has made herself into a perfect aesthetic object and destroyed herself in the process. Snow White rather than try to beat her in the contest of appearances must create a new game based on a different meaning of ���fairness�۝ and on her own modest real-girl appeal." stumbling through the forest and racing through an awkward Shakespeare-lite speech to her hastily mustered good-guy army understands the job perfectly and undertakes it in good faith. Her Snow White is part of an interesting new breed of warrior princesses ��� Katniss Everdeen is their current leader ��� whose ascendance reflects the convergence of commercial calculations and cultural longings. Long may they reign." monsters and whispers of sexual implication."

Inc.�۝ the director L̩a Pool takes aim at the breast cancer movement and the corporations that benefit from its ubiquitous rosy symbol of awareness and action. Yet for all the stellar intentions; revelatory evidence; and thoughtful wall-to-wall interviewees this frustratingly overstuffed documentary indulges more in spraying buckshot than stalking a target." because the film highlights legitimate concerns that others notably the medical sociologist Gayle Sulik have been digging into for years including the questionable commingling of marketing and philanthropy and the prioritization of pharmaceutical solutions over prevention. Casting a pink veil of positivity over a dark and dreadful disease we are told encourages the myth of progress and distracts from treatment options that remain limited to what Dr. Susan Love calls ���slash burn and poison�۝ and mortality rates that have barely altered in six decades." however don�۪t sell products. Arguing forcefully that corporate sponsorship of this so-called pink culture is more likely to fatten bottom lines ��� or rehabilitate a damaged image ��� than result in a cure Ms. Pool wonders who is being served by a fuchsia Niagara Falls or a blushing bucket of KFC. But though poking indignantly at the close ties between nonprofit giants like Susan G. Komen for the Cure and for example large chemical companies whose goals are unlikely to include investing in explorations of suspected links between cancer and pollution the film fails to offer substantive financial analyses. Where exactly do all these millions in charitable donations go? There may well be too many players to track but Komen�۪s detailed financial statements freely available on its Web site might be a good place to begin." ���Pink Ribbons�۝ (based on the 2008 book by Samantha King) is a head-reeling hot-button mess. Only in one segment does the fog fully clear as we meet a dignified group of women weathering metastatic disease. Through these faces of pain fear and anger and with the lucid guidance of Barbara Ehrenreich (drawing on her brilliant 2001 essay ���Welcome to Cancerland�۝) we understand how the movement�۪s Mardi Gras atmosphere and ���tyranny of cheerfulness�۝ ��� walk run smile be a warrior! ��� serve marketers more than the terminally ill." this well-intentioned blur of accusations advertising clips and pink-washed events nevertheless deserves to be seen. At the very least the movement�۪s apparent drive to make breast cancer in the words of Ms. Ehrenreich ���pretty and feminine and normal�۝ should raise our hackles. ���It�۪s not �۝ she insists. ���It�۪s horrible.

The symphonic score by James Horner confers an inspirational mood that is uplifting without being syrupy." its characters are clear-cut saints and sinners. To its credit the film acknowledges the political history leading up to the war and the bargaining behind the scenes. Bruce Greenwood plays Dwight Morrow the United States ambassador to Mexico dispatched from Washington to protect American oil interests while brokering a peace." which had been simmering for years erupted when the Mexican president Plutarco Elias Calles (Rub̩n Blades) expanded and began brutally enforcing the anticlerical laws of the country�۪s 1917 constitution.

There is no shortage of information and opinion about the Middle East and this film made collaboratively by Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi is partly a piece of advocacy journalism. But it is also a visual essay in autobiography and as such a modest rigorous and moving work of art." a Palestinian farmer in the tiny town of Bilin was given his first camera in 2005 when his youngest son Gibreel was born. Almost simultaneously the Israeli Army began building a barrier between Bilin and a nearby Jewish settlement." outraged as their olive groves were bulldozed by the military and burned by settlers organized weekly protests attended by left-wing Israelis and sympathizers from other countries. In 2007 the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the barrier rerouted and four years later after village access to some of the land was restored the demonstrations were called off. Mr. Burnat�۪s was not the only camera present at these protests but the footage he shot which is accompanied by after-the-fact voice-over narration and part of a video diary of his daily life is especially poignant and intimate." a Jewish Israeli filmmaker combed through hundreds of hours of images gathered over more than five years. In the course of the condensed narrative that results from their editing we meet Mr. Burnat�۪s family and his neighbors sometimes captured in candid moments and sometimes it appears acting out such moments for the camera. Or cameras rather since the soldiers and settlers are not always happy to be filmed and it is hard to protect a delicate piece of electronic equipment when rocks rubber bullets and tear gas grenades are flying." but the consequences could hardly be more serious. There are injuries ��� including one sustained by Mr. Burnat himself ��� and several deaths. Many of these incidents are captured in real time at close range (in some cases by other people�۪s cameras) and the cumulative effect on the viewer is an intense despairing sense of frustration." however is more philosophical even when his pain and indignation are at their highest pitch. He notes the intersection of his family�۪s life with the ebb and flow of Palestinian and Israeli politics from the relative optimism of the post-Oslo years in the early 1990s (when his first son was born) to the current era of diplomatic stasis and ideological retrenchment. He lives through periods of anxiety and horror and yet remains attuned to the fine grain of everyday experience as his children grow up his hair turns gray and he has to find a new camera." above all as a film ��� may be the only concrete hope Mr. Burnat and Mr. Davidi have to offer." but rather that even in the midst of that crisis it is more than just politics that needs to be seen and understood."

The girl and the boy are very serious ��� about love their plans books life itself ��� and often act older than their age. She wears bright blue eyeliner; he puffs on a corncob pipe. You wonder what their hurry is given that here adulthood with its quarrels regrets and anguished pillow talk can feel as dangerous as the storm that�۪s hurtling toward the island ready to blow it all down." �۝ which opened the 65th Cannes Film Festival on May 16 are gifted and according to grown-ups who are supposed to know about such things problem children. Suzy (Kara Hayward) definitely knows this about herself because she discovered a copy of a pamphlet ���Coping With the Very Troubled Child �۝ on top of the family fridge. She does have a temper but she also has three younger brothers which may help explain her tantrums. Yet like many characters in Mr. Anderson�۪s films she�۪s also troubled on a deeper level beset by an existential despair that waned when while getting ready for a performance of Benjamin Britten�۪s opera ���Noye�۪s Fludde�۝ a year earlier she met her match her soul mate her co-conspirator Sam (Jared Gilman)." part romance with a touch of film noir and a hint of the French New Wave. Along the way there are dangers both natural and human and finally paradise in a small pretty cove they rename Moonrise Kingdom. (Working with his regular cinematographer Robert Yeoman Mr. Anderson softens the colors and gives them the slight tint of a faded Polaroid photograph.) There with a tent a French pop song and unembarrassed honesty (Sam warns Suzy that he may wet the bed) they consummate metaphorically an enchanted chaste affair capped with a hilariously symbolic deflowering." ���Bottle Rocket �۝ Mr. Anderson has directed a series of personal films about characters ��� a schoolboy visionary traveling brothers wily thieves ��� who through their harebrained schemes grand pursuits or art (these are finally indistinguishable) transcend the ordinary. The same is true in ���Moonrise Kingdom �۝ which traces how Suzy and Sam met how they wrote to each other shared their secrets and plans and then went off on their adventure (their life) throwing the island�۪s adults into a panic. In other words it�۪s about how they construct a world parallel to the larger one carving out an intensely individual space and defining themselves through their shared visions and actions which means that the movie is also very much about creation as an act of self-creation." including his last one the truly fantastic ���Fantastic Mr. Fox �۝ there�۪s a deliberate self-conscious once-upon-a-time quality to ���Moonrise Kingdom.�۝ From the minute the film opens quickly settling on a needlepoint image of a house ��� a representation of the one in which Suzy lives where it all begins ��� Mr. Anderson who�۪s more fabulist than traditional realist underscores the obvious point that you�۪re watching a story. This heightened sense of self-awareness is underscored by the exhilarating camera movements that sweep across the house from right to left left to right and up and down and take you on a time and space tour through the house past Suzy�۪s father and mother Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand both touching)." machine and human this overture introduces the Bishops suggesting who they are and what they�۪re like (the books indicate that this is a reading family) and some crucial leitmotifs. A pair of binoculars points to the coming adventure (and suggests a far-reaching vision) and a kitten alludes to the vulnerability of the future adventurers." a spatial configuration that underscores that they might as well inhabit separate universes (which they do). Early in the scene one of the boys puts on a record of Britten�۪s ���Young Person�۪s Guide to the Orchestra�۝ (Op. 34 Themes A-F) �۝ which the composer working off Purcell�۪s ���Moor�۪s Revenge �۝ wrote as an instruction for children about musical composition." primarily it seems because he makes personal rather than industrial films that don�۪t look move or feel like anyone else�۪s. The people in his work their passions and dramas are true and recognizable ��� and rarely more deeply felt than in ���Moonrise Kingdom�۝ ��� but they exist in a world apart one made with extraordinary detail care and I think love by Mr. Anderson. Sometimes they�۪re called dollhouse worlds though truly they feel more authentic than many screen realities." in other words are his own. He draws you into his fantastical worlds with beauty and humor and while their artifice can keep you at somewhat of a distance this only deepens the story�۪s emotional power especially when he lowers the boom as he always does. The New England coastal island of Penzance for instance where ���Moonrise Kingdom�۝ takes place is firmly set in Wes Anderson-land as is the Bishops�۪ home and the scout camp that Sam runs away from. Like the Bishops the Khaki Scouts at Camp Ivanhoe are initially something of an isolated ecosystem. Led by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) the boys do all the usual scouting things but with funny alarming strange twists like building a tree house as high as an eagle�۪s aerie." Mr. Anderson shoots the camp with a moving camera one that follows Ward in profile during his morning inspection. Although you can see well into the distance to the rolling treed hills that serve as the camp�۪s backdrop Mr. Anderson has shot the scene so that the depth of the image has been flattened. This visual compression makes the campsite look something like a page out of a book and is even more obvious elsewhere as in a long shot of a lighthouse a car and a small building. That�۪s where the island�۪s law officer Captain Sharp (a wonderful Bruce Willis) learns soon after Sam and Suzy run off that the boy is being given up by his foster parents because they�۪ve decided that he�۪s emotionally disturbed. Wouldn�۪t you be with parents like these?" ���Moonrise Kingdom�۝ breezes along with a beautifully coordinated admixture of droll humor deadpan and slapstick. Like all of Mr. Anderson�۪s films though there�۪s a deep pervasive melancholia here too a sense of regret evident in Mr. Bishop�۪s slouch (with his plaid pants he is a walking John Cheever tragedy) and in the way Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop look and don�۪t look at each other. Adulthood can seem so desperately painful so maybe Sam and Suzy shouldn�۪t be quite as eager to grow up." while their story has the charms of a fairy tale and some of its terrors aren�۪t playing at love. They are in love and that is the most real thing in the world." tent-sharing and a bloody ear-piercing."

You are keenly aware of the distance between Elena a former nurse from a proletarian background and the imperious hard-nosed Vladimir whom she cared for while he recovered from peritonitis a decade earlier and then married. It�۪s not that they loathe each other. When he signals that he wants sex she matter-of-factly obliges him." entitled daughter Katerina (Yelena Lyadova) who lives solely for pleasure on the money he sends her. Elena�۪s unemployed son Sergey (Alexey Rozin) whom she regularly visits in Moscow�۪s crumbling industrial fringe is a heavy-drinking lout who shares cramped quarters with his wife and two children." Sasha (Igor Ogurtsov) will have to join the army unless Sergey can buy the boy�۪s way into college she promises to help although Sasha has no interest in his studies. Any money she brings has to be wheedled out of Vladimir who despises her family and its slovenly ways. When Elena returns home and pleads Sasha�۪s case he balks." but their upscale neighborhood is weirdly devoid of people. An ominous calm hangs over the area except for the cawing of crows which can be heard indoors as well as out. And the movie�۪s acute aural awareness of the animal kingdom within the city underscores its vision of Moscow as a jungle teeming with predatory wildlife." watchful attitude is during a teenage brawl in the junk-filled field outside Sergey�۪s house. Filmed with a hand-held camera the fracas suggests a bunch of wild dogs tearing at one another." cooking and talk shows and you are uncomfortably aware of the sounds of appliances and of sliding doors and curtains." and the father and daughter after years of mutual hostility discover a ghoulish rapport in their shared nihilism. Katerina now drinks and takes drugs only on weekends she announces sardonically but is ���still getting food and sex under control.�۝" �۝ she explains. ���Rotten seeds. We�۪re all bad seeds subhuman.�۝" she sarcastically replies: ���What�۪s pointless is producing offspring you know will be sick and doomed since the parents are sick and doomed themselves.

Vladimir stuns her by bluntly announcing that he is about to prepare his will in which he leaves almost everything to Katerina while providing Elena with a life annuity to be distributed in monthly payments." �۝ he replies sternly." Elena makes an impulsive fateful decision that casts her in a different light. But the screenplay written by the director with Oleg Negin recognizes her humanity. Even as Elena contemplates the unthinkable Ms. Markina�۪s grand subtle performance reinforces the film�۪s view of her as its most compassionate character." that isn�۪t saying much about these products of rotten seeds locked in a life-or-death Darwinian struggle."

But it may be enough to turn the tables on anyone who decides to take offense which is really the point." self-indulgent grossness celebrity cameos and strenuous whimsy represents a fairly standard recipe for sketch-comedy-derived feature films. Mr. Baron Cohen a nimble performer long of face and limb is like a cross between a camel and a chameleon. He seems capable of an almost infinite range of voices and appearances all of them outlandish and all of them at least potentially funny." �۝ which gestures halfheartedly toward topicality and with equal lack of conviction toward pure anarchic silliness. Aladeen having alarmed the world with his human-rights abuses and his nuclear ambitions is summoned to New York to address the United Nations." thanks to the scheming of his Uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) and the ministrations of an American agent (an uncredited John C. Reilly) he finds himself replaced by a moronic double (also Mr. Baron Cohen) and forced to wander the streets like an ordinary nobody. He meets a wide-eyed activist named Zoey (Anna Faris) who gives him a job at her food co-op and finds a sidekick (Jason Mantzoukas) who used to be one of Wadiya�۪s top scientists." but many more that feel half-baked and rehashed. There is for example a long scene in a restaurant frequented by Wadiyan refugees in which Aladeen hoping not to be recognized invents a series of false names for himself." �۝ and the like ��� and every time he comes up with a new one the camera pans over to the sign just to make sure we understand what�۪s going on. And in case we�۪re slow on the uptake the waiter (Fred Armisen) keeps insisting ���That�۪s a made-up name.�۝ The joke is repeated at least four times." or it represents a profound lack of confidence in both the material and the audience. Either way: So what?" and supplying Aladeen with a love interest forces Mr. Baron Cohen to try sincerity something for which he has no particular aptitude. Since women in his comic universe exist to be made fun of rather than to be funny Ms. Faris�۪s talents are pretty much wasted. Zoey is the target of Aladeen�۪s abuse and also of the film�۪s scattershot misogyny which is like the dictator himself conveniently disguised. When Aladeen calls her a ���lesbian Hobbit�۝ or recoils at the sight of her unshaved armpits we�۪re really laughing at what a jerk he is. Aren�۪t we? Sure we are." Borat and Ali G Admiral General Aladeen is not meant to fool anyone into thinking that he is real so viewers are denied the full measure of smugness that is Mr. Baron Cohen�۪s special gift to bestow. In the earlier projects (���Da Ali G Show�۝ and the movies ���Borat�۝ and ���Br�_no�۝) viewers were invited to chuckle at the appalling idiocy of Mr. Baron Cohen�۪s characters and also at the stupidity of the suckers who took his buffoonery at face value." the cretin of Kazakhstan carried a bag of his own feces to the table at a genteel dinner party the joke lay both in the outrageousness of his behavior and somehow in the dismayed ��� yet still curiously polite ��� reaction of his American hosts. We could laugh at his grossness secure in the knowledge that we weren�۪t really xenophobic because we were also sneering at the fools falling for the trick. Dumb hicks. Dumb foreigners.

The film by the co-director of the ���Paradise Lost�۝ trilogy does an excellent job of recapitulating the controversies surrounding the album�۪s creation without bearing down too heavily on old news while subtly taking Mr. Simon�۪s side against his critics." the lyrics for ���Graceland�۝ were not political but pop and their language playful and absurdist.

the spooky goth girls and deathly pale boys none wear their ghoulishness as lightly or winningly as Johnny Depp. And what a bewitching corpse he makes in ���Dark Shadows �۝ Mr. Burton�۪s most pleasurable film in years. As Barnabas Collins the scion of a wealthy family turned unwilling vampire Mr. Depp has a face as white as chalk and long-fingered hands that skim the air like skittering spiders. After 200 years of entombment Barnabas awakes in 1972 and like a latter-day Rip van Winkle only thirstier drinks in a world populated by monsters living and dead and lovingly adorned with Mr. Burton�۪s signature kinks." his playfulness and macabre wit are justification enough for such an ephemeral enterprise which fondly revisits the creaky supernatural-themed American daytime soap that ran from 1966 to 1971. Created by Dan Curtis whose other creep shows included ���Kolchak: The Night Stalker �۝ ���Dark Shadows�۝ became a cult favorite when it introduced Barnabas (Jonathan Frid who died last month) a vampire hero drawn along far more romantic lines than Bram Stoker�۪s Dracula. Mr. Burton�۪s movie written by Seth Grahame-Smith (author of satirical novels like ���Pride and Prejudice and Zombies�۝) riffs on the Barnabas origin story plucked from the soap and ���House of Dark Shadows �۝ one of two films the show spawned." Barnabas economically details the Collins family history in once-upon-a-time fashion from its rise to its fall and including some disastrous lord-of-the-manor grappling with a maid Angelique (the French actress Eva Green frisky funny and excellent) who paws at Barnabas�۪s body while Josette (Bella Heathcote a typical Burton Kewpie doll and a recent Australian import) runs off with his heart. Three�۪s a crowd and Angelique is a witch so after a little boil toil and trouble she casts a spell that leaves Josette dead and Barnabas bereft fanged and weeping sanguineous tears. In typical horror fashion a mob descends on him leading to his timeout in a deep grave until he�۪s disinterred in the 1970s whereupon Mr. Burton cues the Carpenters and happily cuts loose." and it�۪s delightful to watch how the actor handles the vampire�۪s readjustment to the world of the living which after he has thrown back some invigorating human Slurpees and faced down a ���demon�۝ (a car) he does with both lofty entitlement and abject bewilderment. Barnabas has the good looks of a vampire lover but the character�۪s wide-eyed somewhat baffled manner in consort with his mysterious powers means he mostly comes across like a visitor from another planet more E. T. than Christopher Lee. Later hiding from the sun under dark glasses a fedora and an umbrella ��� Stoker�۪s creation moves around in daylight too so this isn�۪t as revisionist as it may seem ��� Barnabas also suggests the later-life Michael Jackson." the most memorable characters in Mr. Burton and Mr. Depp�۪s previous seven films together Barnabas is at once recognizably human and inescapably different from the people around him. Alienation runs in his blood literally. This sense of detachment remains even after he returns to the now-dilapidated Collins family manse where amid the picturesque decay and scattered children�۪s toys ��� a nice suburban touch ��� he meets his living descendants including the matriarch Elizabeth (a wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer loopy and steely); her dissolute brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller); her teenage daughter Carolyn (Chlo�� Grace Moretz); and Roger�۪s son David (Gully McGrath) whose dark looks recall the evil tot in the 1976 horror flick ���The Omen.�۝ Barnabas of course fits right in with this freak show even while remaining his own (dead) man." Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) replicates the signature Shelley Winters image from ���The Night of the Hunter �۝ while the caretaker Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley) wields an ax that looks borrowed from Jack Nicholson in ���The Shining.�۝ Such sampling never becomes distracting and with the terrific period songs (Curtis Mayfield T. Rex Iggy and the Stooges) gives ���Dark Shadows�۝ the feel of a pop-cultural archaeological dig. That makes sense given that Mr. Burton�۪s film resurrects an old television show that was partly inspired by the 1950s and �۪60s vampire flicks produced by the British studio Hammer which were in turn influenced by decades of fang-ster gore and glory." mostly involving Barnabas�۪s true love if anyone�۪s interested though traditional storytelling has never been Mr. Burton�۪s specialty or perhaps interest. What counts in his work is the telling not the tale. He isn�۪t big on narrative logic coherence and thrust ��� see ���Mars Attacks! �۝ an exuberant free-for-all ��� focusing instead on his imagery an emphasis that can either bore you to tears as in his ���Alice in Wonderland �۝ or as in ���Dark Shadows �۝ pleasantly slow everything down allowing you to luxuriate in his embroidery and doodling the paintings on the walls the gloom in the halls. Although Mr. Burton�۪s talents can make him seem more like a production designer than a director in his strongest films his visual style can be thrillingly expressive." but it�۪s very enjoyable visually sumptuous and despite its lugubrious source material and a sporadic tremor of violence surprisingly effervescent. There has often been something moribund about Mr. Burton�۪s period efforts and it may be that he tends to be more at ease feels aesthetically freer when he�۪s having fun with pop culture (his inert redo of ���Planet of the Apes�۝ excepted) than adapting high-culture classics. And while there may not be any deeper resonance lurking in his ���Dark Shadows�۝ ��� the show first surfaced in the middle of the Vietnam War when real horror was playing out daily in the news ��� Mr. Burton�۪s gift for deviant beauty and laughter has its own liberating power."

But the continually shifting tone of the movie whose director also did the romantic comedy ���Caramel �۝ keeps you giddily off balance." a beautiful Christian widow who runs a cafe fantasizes a romantic pas de deux with Rabih (Julien Farhat) the Muslim handyman who is painting the place. Is this a musical comedy you wonder? Not really. The number which seems like an outtake from another movie is a playful diversion in a series of skits." �۝ in which the village women sick and tired of losing their menfolk to senseless warfare band together to keep the peace by any means necessary. Their solidarity is established in the opening scene a choreographed march in which a corps of black-clad Christian and Muslim women form a solemn swaying procession to the cemetery." whose houses of worship sit side by side those men are hotheaded bumpkins who profess brotherhood until the tiniest provocation incites them to blind fury. When a troublemaker sends goats into the mosque and the holy water in a church is replaced with chicken blood these dolts go ballistic and reach for their weapons." because the news of religious strife in the region immediately stirs up war fever. Amale and the mayor�۪s wife Yvonne (Yvonne Maalouf) are the prime movers in this gabby female regiment." while praying to a statue of the Virgin Mary fakes a mystical trance from which she relays divine instructions to the men that peace must be kept. In the dead of night some women unearth a cache of buried weapons and hide it." they distract the men by importing a group of Ukrainian strippers who pretend to be stranded after their bus breaks down. As the men gird for war their wives drug them with hashish-laced baked goods then give a wild party where the men are pacified by the glamorous shimmying visitors. If these silly shenanigans are amusing none are developed into the sidesplitting comic set pieces they had the potential to become." a young man is killed in cross-fire while riding his motorbike outside the village. Rather than tell the men who would use the incident as an excuse for war his mother and her friends secretly dispose of his body and spread the word that he has the mumps and is too ill to receive visitors. I won�۪t describe the women�۪s final solution to the religious strife except to say that it is both ingenious and preposterous." this jolly galumphing crowd-pleaser which won the audience award at last year�۪s Toronto International Film Festival is a raucous sitcom about scrappy little boys whose canny mamas conspire to keep them out of trouble."

and ���Tonight You�۪re Mine �۝ David Mackenzie�۪s new film does something similar. In outline it is an absolutely standard meet-cute romantic comedy with the usual obstacles on the way to the central couple�۪s triumphant kiss which takes place against a backdrop of fireworks and cheering crowds. There are inconvenient rivals who must be gotten out of the way and comical sidekicks to lighten the mood. But the look the rhythm and the scruffy on-the-fly ambience of the film make it feel unusually fresh and lively. It may be the same old song but it�۪s also a catchy remix." jumpy energy comes from the setting an actual rock festival in Scotland. Mr. Mackenzie and his crew made their way through the hordes of drunken fans and the muddy tents unassumingly inserting the fictional characters in the midst of real-life musicians and revelers. The director whose previous films include the dour abrasive dramas ���Mister Foe�۝ and ���Young Adam �۝ retains some of the stylistic aggression of those movies but lets go of the overwrought psychology and the swaggering sadism. Like a punk band tiptoeing toward the mainstream ���Tonight You�۪re Mine�۝ does a bit of posturing but it�۪s really all about sweetness and fun." however that first brings Adam (Luke Treadaway) and Morello (Natalia Tena) together. He is the poutier prettier half of a successful American duo called the Make. With his partner Tyko (Mathew Baynton) and a video crew he is rolling onto the festival grounds when a confusing scuffle breaks out with the members of the Dirty Pink an all-female band. Morello who is its leader threatens to smash Adam�۪s guitar; he steals her jacket; and all of a sudden thanks to the intervention of a deus ex machina with a beatific smile and a V.I.P. badge the two antagonists find themselves handcuffed together." it turns out that though they are physically attached to each other they are romantically attached to other people who are not amused at this situation. Adam�۪s girlfriend is a volatile model named Lake (Ruta Gedmintas); Morello is involved with a reliable banker named Mark (Mr. Mackenzie�۪s brother Alastair) and they stick around long enough for all four to tumble awkwardly (and chastely) into bed." and their impromptu duet of ���Tainted Love�۝ provides the film with one of several moments of unembarrassed pop bliss. The link between music and sex is obvious enough and ���Tonight You�۪re Mine�۝ is happy to note some of the tawdry aspects of that connection. But it also captures the romantic ecstatic longing that unites the musicians with one another and with their admirers." but the story is really as simple and earnest as they come handcuffs notwithstanding.

Annie J.

Deciding that this is clearly the fault of her long-estranged mother (the marvelous Mary Beth Peil) currently residing off the grid in the Arizona desert Sarah sets out for an uninvited reunion. Detours to a nightmarish baby shower a Skype-obsessed father and a Vegas masseuse prove depressingly uninvigorating to both Sarah�۪s maternal instincts and the film around her." ���Parts�۝ buries its sly humor beneath wearying scenes of Sarah in transit.

�۝ about four young brothers and sisters forced to survive on their own after their mother abandons them ��� has such an extraordinarily delicate manner with children that his approach can feel like a code of ethics a declaration of honesty toward these often badly used and exploited performers. The gentleness of his approach his stylistic unobtrusiveness and the way that children open up in front of his camera are among the subtle pleasures in his latest film ���I Wish �۝ a quiet seemingly rambling story about two exceptionally capable brothers who have been separated by their parents�۪ bad marriage." a boy of 12 with chipmunk cheeks lives with his mother and grandparents in a cramped apartment in the town of Kagoshima on the island of Kyushu in southwest Japan. It�۪s an unremarkable pedestrian-looking town or would be if Sakurajima an active volcano didn�۪t steadily dust everything in a blizzard of ash. No one seems terribly bothered by the ash or wears the familiar white surgical masks. Few seem even to notice the volcano other than Koichi who reasonably wonders why everyone is so calm. He�۪s less afraid than puzzled and as he walks to school he also questions why the building was built on a hill. ���I don�۪t get it �۝ he says and not for the first time." as a symbol say of churning emotions the volcano is of real existential concern for Koichi. He�۪s a little kid; it�۪s a big volcano ��� and an even bigger and more uncertain world. Outwardly Koichi seems so mature as when he sweeps ash out of his room. But having been separated from his giggly happy younger brother Ryunosuke (played by Koki Maeda�۪s own scene-stealing brother Ohshiro) who lives in another town with their father Kenji (Joe Odagiri) Koichi is very much the questioning learning child." in other words about growing up. And like life or at least like life as seen through Mr. Kore-eda�۪s lens it involves numerous detours not always with apparent purpose. While Koichi and soon Ryunosuke become the story�۪s dual cornerstones with the story toggling back and forth between them their classmates parents and assorted others also drift in and out of the picture. At times Mr. Kore-eda appears to be losing his focus as when he lingers over two old men meandering down a street. (There are moments when his winding here and there feels as if he�۪s doing as much searching as Koichi.) But these characters and their experiences are also pieces in Koichi and Ryunosuke�۪s fragmented lives." so it must be right ��� that wishes come true for those who stand in a certain spot in front of two passing trains. Marshaling some friends and coordinating with Ryunosuke he heads off to wish for his family to be reunited a grand adventure that is more persuasive in its emotional reverberations than in its practical details. That scarcely matters and soon becomes beside the point of Mr. Kore-eda�۪s gift for carefully excavating deep emotions that his characters cannot express or may not be conscious of. ���I Wish�۝ tends toward the vaporous and not just because of its volcano; but whenever its children are on screen lighted up with joy or dimmed by hard adult truths the film burns bright."

That�۪s after she�۪s practiced her Clint Eastwood moves in the mirror with her gun (a birthday present): ���You feel lucky punk?�۝ Well uh do you?" ���Hick�۝ sends its young heroine ��� more literary creation than credible teenager ��� into the big bad American heartland. It�۪s a place of dank pool halls one-street towns and shabby motels a mythopoetic jumble of dangers and snares taken from other better movies and books." and the fakiness carries over to the characters Luli meets on the road. There�۪s Glenda (a surprisingly good Blake Lively) a grifter with a heart of gold who smokes pink cigarettes and dispenses wisdom; and Eddie a psychotic cowboy with a limp (an effective Eddie Redmayne). Luli�۪s scenes with Glenda are improbable but amusing. Her scenes with Eddie are improbable and creepy. And Glenda and Eddie�۪s climactic scene is flat-out ridiculous." and it�۪s not helped by Mr. Martini who can�۪t find the right tone. Patsy Cline�۪s ���Sweet Dreams�۝ for a (thankfully off-screen) rape scene? Forced irony or klutziness? Too often that�۪s the question you ask of ���Hick �۝ which makes the answer all too clear." crack whores and outdated clich̩s about America."

the teenage heroine of Patricia Riggen�۪s ���Girl in Progress �۝ has an outline of the stages of her planned coming of age. Derived from a longish montage�۪s worth of research the chart is also a knowing encyclopedia of teen-movie clich̩s. Ansiedad is a bright Seattle high school student who looks young for her age even though she is in some ways wise beyond her years. (Ms. Ramirez turned 17 this year.) She is determined to grow up fast and to get away from her mother Grace (Eva Mendes) who also may have some growing up to do." with the help of her best friend Tavita (Raini Rodriguez) plots a course of familiar milestones. ���Dump Best Friend�۝ is one of them. ���Lose Virginity�۝ is another and they add up to a familiar arc of recklessness redemption and regret." and therefore has control over the exasperating and sometimes nonsensical scripts that young women are expected to follow." feminist adolescent comedy that is a kind of older sister to ���Girl in Progress�۝ ��� certain stereotypes and assumptions may be stupid but that does not mean they are easily outsmarted. Ansiedad�۪s cleverness backfires in some predictable ways and in others that are surprising and the movie by virtue of its self-conscious parody of the kind of movie it is turns out to be an unusually smart and sensitive example of the genre." Hiram Martinez forthrightly acknowledge class and ethnicity realities that most filmmakers prefer to sentimentalize or avoid altogether. Grace originally named Altagracia is a single mother juggling jobs an affair with a married doctor (Matthew Modine) and her own ambivalence about adulthood. A teenager when Ansiedad was born she has bounced around ever since making a life for herself and her daughter out of menial jobs ��� including as a maid for her current paramour ��� and dead-end relationships." but rather that such behavior is part of her complicated sympathetically considered humanity." disapproving eyes and we only gradually come to understand her point of view. At the same time we perceive the limits of Ansiedad�۪s precocious but nonetheless na��ve way of looking at life." especially given the flatness of Ms. Riggen�۪s direction. Ms. Mendes seems so confident so comfortable in her beauty that it can be easy to underestimate her emotional range and her comic instincts. Here she is entirely believable (even when the story is not) as a woman who is constantly improvising as she pursues pleasure dignity and security. Ms. Ramirez is equally assured ��� marvelous actually in her portrayal of a girl facing a similar kind of confusion." then again what did you expect? A coming-of-age story however realistic it might be is also a kind of fable a picture of how we hope things turn out." which it recognizes as trite but also necessary."

Sebald the German-born author of ���The Emigrants �۝ ���Austerlitz�۝ and ���The Rings of Saturn �۝ who died in a car accident in 2001 at 57 had a sensibility sufficiently distinctive to warrant such immortality. The only problem ��� or rather the characteristic paradox ��� is that ���Sebaldian�۝ would have to mean something like ���systematically resistant to classification.�۝ Was he a novelist? A memoirist? A historian? A travel writer?" the author replied ���All of them.�۝ ���Patience (After Sebald) �۝ Grant Gee�۪s admiring documentary is appropriately Sebaldian." �۝ a 1998 chronicle of an English walking tour that is sometimes read as an invitation to a pilgrimage ���Patience�۝ combines a number of genres into a compact digressive 82 minutes.

They will be gratified by the combination of obsessiveness and calm ��� a very Sebaldian alloy of moods ��� that Mr. Gee brings to a project whose straightforwardness conceals a vast ambition. But curious souls new to this writer will discover a useful introduction (including passages from ���The Rings of Saturn �۝ read by the actor Jonathan Pryce) and a handy map." he set out to walk the county of Suffolk in East Anglia where he had lived teaching literature in Norwich since 1970. In the course of a tour that took him through sturdy English towns wild heaths and desolate coastal areas he mused and brooded on the present and the past." an eminent Sebaldian ��� owing to both his love of Sebald�۪s work and his own similarly melancholy tendencies ��� displays a chart of the book�۪s interlocking motifs. Barbara Hui an enterprising literary scholar shares an ingenious digital map showing not only the places Sebald visited on his ���Rings of Saturn�۝ walk but also the places he imagined thought about or mentioned at each spot. Talking heads occasionally appear on screen but usually their voices counterpoint a collage of images most of them black and white that retrace Sebald�۪s steps." he remains an elusive figure and this too seems appropriate. If he is a self-revealing writer it is not in the usual confessional sense but rather because he seems so strongly present in his books with a personality that is both the source and aftereffect of the prose." in the end offer much in the way of explanation. It does not solve the puzzle of an oeuvre that as it made its way from German to English established its creator as a major and unique force in world literature.

�۝ a film you want to wrap your arms around and shelter from a ruthless marketplace. Like something that David Gordon Green might have made before being seduced by more generously financed projects this fragile sophomore feature written and directed by Steve Collins reminds us that watching movies matters much more than listening to them." Mr. Collins trusts his precisely self-contained images (exquisitely photographed by Jeremy Saulnier) and the subtle skills of his actors to communicate the shifting emotions of an awkward love triangle. Its anchor is a gentle wistful nanny (John Merriman) whose eyes radiate anxiety." a wounded redhead who seems constantly on the verge of blurting out the film�۪s title? Or does it have to do with the fun-loving third wheel (Macon Blair) who seems more in need of friendship than of romance?" ���Feelings�۝ is a small-scale wonder. Pivotal events play out in the spaces between scenes leaving only emotional imprints that we interpret within a timeline that may not be entirely linear." little Lilian Collins the director�۪s daughter would toddle away with it) and each moment is so richly detailed that we are rarely confused.

Instead of Italy in the 1920s the place of renewal is Jaipur India and the time is now." they discover a place that is far from the luxurious retreat ���for the elderly and beautiful�۝ that its advertising claims. But after much grumbling most of them take it in stride and begin to flourish." Maggie Smith Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy this leisurely paced two-hour movie is a reasonably tasty banquet for the same Anglophiles who embrace ���Downton Abbey.�۝ Although it�۪s not as tidy or comfy as that self-congratulating fantasy of British noblesse oblige or as elevated as the Merchant-Ivory films set in India it�۪ll do nicely." from a screenplay by Ol Parker and based on Deborah Moggach�۪s novel ���These Foolish Things �۝ it begins with brief sketches of the travelers. Evelyn Greenslade (Ms. Dench) whose blog entries read aloud set the movie�۪s timeline is a recent widow forced to sell her home after learning that her husband squandered their nest egg. Evelyn is a game can-do woman who is first glimpsed in England trying to communicate over the telephone with a robotic operator at an Indian call center. Once in Jaipur she takes a satisfying job instructing workers at a similar center on how to converse with overseas callers." and her rejection of all things Indian while her husband happily explores the nearby temples precipitate an inevitable explosion." who she is brusquely informed died several years earlier. Norman who in an early scene finds himself humiliated at a speed-dating event is an indefatigable rogue with a pocket of Viagra." a retired High Court judge grew up in Jaipur and is returning there for the first time since his youth. A gay man ���more in theory than in practice nowadays �۝ as he puts it Graham hopes to reconnect with his youthful Indian lover whose family was disgraced when their affair was discovered." a xenophobic racist termagant and retired housekeeper in need of a hip replacement makes the trip because the surgery in India is cheaper and doesn�۪t entail a monthslong wait. The character has the screenplay�۪s meanest and snappiest lines but it is beyond even Ms. Smith�۪s capacity to make Muriel�۪s eventual metamorphosis from monster into sweet caring old lady who befriends a low-caste Indian servant remotely credible." Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) is a wildly disorganized but enthusiastic young man who neglected to inform his guests ahead of time that the hotel has no working telephones and that some rooms are without doors. Mr. Patel (the lead in ���Slumdog Millionaire�۝) is the movie�۪s comic grounding wire whose hyperkinetic performance verges on slapstick. Sonny under intense pressure from his haughty domineering mother to give up the hotel and agree to an arranged marriage in Delhi is in love with Sunaina (Tena Desae) a call center worker." its ace in the hole is its pungent depiction of Jaipur�۪s teeming streets which give an otherwise well-mannered movie a blinding splash of color."

�۝ an appealing largely upbeat documentary about young ballet dancers duking it out sometimes on point and in tulle for top honors at the Youth America Grand Prix." this prominent competition hands out both actual contracts and more than a quarter of a million dollars in scholarships to dance schools. Soloists 9 to 19 from Australia to Ukraine have up to two and a half minutes (ensembles have up to six) to wow the judges and perhaps change their lives. In ���First Position �۝ they have 94 minutes to win you over first as a group as seemingly alike as the cygnets in ���Swan Lake �۝ and later as stars." leaping and turning are six children all irresistible and in their different ways also heart-melters. There�۪s the youngest of the bunch Jules Jarvis Fogarty (then 10) a cheerful Californian who clearly doesn�۪t care much about his moves and older contestants like Joan Sebastian Zamora (16) a thoughtful Colombian who cares so deeply he moved to New York without his family to study. For more than a year the director Bess Kargman followed Jules Joan and four other children from their homes to their studios while they prepared for the 2010 Grand Prix finals in New York. (The most recent event was in April.) A seventh child Gaya Bommer Yemini (11) a charmer from Israel hovers around the edges." including Aran Bell (11) and Michaela DePrince (14) could have been spun off into separate documentaries. A wisp of a blond boy and the son of endearingly young supportive parents (including his military doctor father) Aran captures your attention with his gravity and drops your jaw with his extraordinary physical lightness ��� he seems untethered by gravity. For her part Michaela an orphan from Sierra Leone adopted by older Americans (a quick somewhat comical introductory shot of a menorah indiscreetly suggests the unsaid) may leave you a puddled mess by the time she finishes telling her story. But it�۪s how she came to ballet ��� through the image of a ballerina in an old magazine ��� that does you in and shows off Ms. Kargman�۪s storytelling instincts." almost matter-of-factly prosaic. Shooting in digital and working with the director of photography Nick Higgins she tagged after her subjects traveling across the United States as well as to Europe and Latin America. This gives the movie a sense of depth as when she follows Joan home to Colombia; but because she chased six different children ceaselessly cutting from one to another it also means she could only skim the surface. She�۪s an efficient filmmaker however and using batches of on-screen text and some ruthless editing ��� the competition dances are unfortunately cut down ��� she manages to create pocket portraits of children whose dedication to their art is by turns inspiring daunting and at times a little frightening." inspiring oohs and ahs just by their presence. Wee ones who compete against one another like those in ���First Position�۝ ��� their little lips trembling with effort small bodies straining against cruel odds ��� are even more irresistible which makes the movie something of a slam dunk when it comes to audience love. This partly explains recent competition-oriented documentaries like ���Mad Hot Ballroom�۝ (about ballroom dance); ���Spellbound�۝ (spelling bee); ���Whiz Kids�۝ (science); ���Koran by Heart�۝ (memorization); and ���Brooklyn Castle�۝ (chess). Given that documentary filmmaking is itself a competitive field with its makers vying for grants production money festival slots distribution deals awards and audiences it�۪s a subject that is clearly near and dear to the documentarian heart." who danced ballet when she was younger and graduated from Columbia�۪s Graduate School of Journalism in 2008 was inspired to make ���First Position.�۝ More simply she has said her curiosity was piqued when she saw a banner for the Grand Prix three years ago. That moment of serendipity led her first to the Grand Prix and one of its founders Larissa Saveliev. Ms. Saveliev liked Ms. Kargman�۪s approach and said in an article that ran in The New York Times that filmmakers usually ���want to see the fights the teachers anorexia �۝ angles that the Grand Prix was not interested in supporting for a movie. Ms. Saveliev also helped Ms. Kargman winnow the contestants to find those who would work as documentary subjects." which turn some documentaries into veritable advertisements and it isn�۪t any less likable as a viewing experience because it was sanctioned by the very organization that coordinates the contest driving these children. Yet by not underscoring Ms. Saveliev�۪s input Ms. Kargman obscured crucial information in a story that she otherwise serves well. And it leaves unanswered whether Ms. Saveliev�۪s involvement accounts for the movie�۪s aspirational almost boosterish vibe and why Ms. Kargman didn�۪t include substantive criticisms of ballet competitions which are as it turns out not universally supported in the dance world."

It is not as if the number of movies featuring troubled guys wearing costumes and fighting evil has diminished since then. Quite the contrary. But the genre though it is still in a period of commercial ascendancy has also entered a phase of imaginative decadence. (Do you really want to have an argument about this? If so put on your best oversize metal suit and wait for me at the top of the New York Times building. I�۪ll be there as soon as I finish beta-testing my death ray.

Written and directed by Joss Whedon this movie revels in the individuality of its mighty mythical characters pinpointing insecurities that are amplified by superhuman power and catching sparks that fly when big rough-edged egos (and alter egos) collide. The best scenes are not the overblown skull-assaulting action sequences ��� which add remarkably little that will be fresh or surprising to devotees of the ���Transformers�۝ franchise ��� but the moments in between when the assembled heroes have the opportunity to brag banter flirt and bicker." that something else being a giant A.T.M. for Marvel and its new studio overlords the Walt Disney Company. At times ��� when various members of a game and nimble cast amble in and out of the glassy metallic chambers of a massive flying aircraft carrier cracking wise rolling eyes and occasionally throwing a punch ��� the movie has some of the easygoing charm of ���Rio Bravo �۝ Howard Hawks�۪s great late western in which John Wayne Angie Dickinson Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson did a lot of talking on their way to a big and not-all-that-interesting shootout." in keeping with the imperatives of global franchise entertainment the big shootout in ���The Avengers�۝ must be enormous of a scale and duration that obliterates everything else. A hole opens in the sky disgorging metallic warriors on Jet Skis and big snakey things that inflict serious digital damage on the Manhattan skyline. Before that there are similarly overdone combat sequences. None of them matches in cinematic wit or visceral surprise a sucker punch landed by the Hulk on Thor�۪s lantern jaw or a cartoonish smackdown delivered by that same angry green fellow on Loki Thor�۪s adoptive brother and this episode�۪s main villain." a disgraced Asgardian princeling with a spear and magic helmet is after the tesseract a glowing blue cube of pure energy. With the help of a couple of brainwashed turncoats Loki has pried it away from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) a world-government spymaster with a lot of semi-secret projects up his sleeve. He assembles a team to get it back consisting of the guys we�۪ve seen in the other movies (including Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson the series�۪s hardest-working nonsuperhero and its most reliable comic asset) as well as Ms. Johansson�۪s Black Widow. Eventually Jeremy Renner�۪s Hawkeye joins up too mostly to glower and shoot a lot of arrows." with an eye patch and his well-practiced bellow is more master of ceremonies than mission commander and under his watch the Avengers indulge in some Rat Pack-y horsing around. Captain America (Chris Evans) is teased for being an out-of-touch old-timer Thor for being a longhaired deity from another planet. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is his usual mischievous playboy self distinguishable from Sherlock Holmes at this point thanks only to his accent and the brief presence of Gwyneth Paltrow in his penthouse. The newcomer ��� and every intellectual�۪s favorite comic-book-based movie character from now on ��� is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner a mopey hesitant genius who turns large and green when angry." �۝ he says at one point and while ���The Avengers�۝ is hardly worth raging about its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding hectic emptiness the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre. Mr. Whedon�۪s playful democratic pop sensibility is no match for the glowering authoritarianism that now defines Hollywood�۪s comic-book universe. Some of the rebel spirit of Mr. Whedon�۪s early projects ���Buffy the Vampire Slayer �۝ ���Firefly�۝ and ���Serenity�۝ creeps in around the edges but as detail and decoration rather than as the animating ethos." �۝ Malcolm Reynolds famously said in ���Serenity.�۝ But for all their maverick swagger the Avengers are dutiful corporate citizens serving a conveniently vague set of principles. Are they serving private interests big government their own vanity or what? It hardly matters because the true guiding spirit of their movie is Loki who promises to set the human race free from freedom and who can be counted on for a big show wherever he goes. In Germany he compels a crowd to kneel before him in mute terrified awe and ���The Avengers �۝ which recently opened there to huge box office returns expects a similarly submissive audience here at home.

In particular he studies ��� and tries to raise public awareness about ��� the rapid depletion of water supplies caused by agricultural overuse rampant development and global climate change. His analyses are thorough and clear and he presents them at public meetings and straight to Ms. Yu�۪s camera with good-natured patience. For the most part that is. At one point contemplating a future of unchecked consumption and political paralysis he sums it all up in blunt layman�۪s terms: ���We�۪re screwed.�۝" or even for the genre to which it belongs. The global-catastrophe documentary is a thriving form these days as the apparent unsustainability of human life has emerged as fertile ground for cinematic journalism. ���Last Call at the Oasis�۝ follows ���Payback �۝ ���Surviving Progress�۝ and ���The Island President�۝ ��� to name only some of the most recent releases ��� in a drumbeat of elemental doom. The food we eat the stuff we buy the air we breathe the fuel we burn the water we drink: it�۪s all killing us!" who has directed scripted television episodes as well as documentaries wraps a lot of bad news into a slick informative fast-moving package. Dwelling mostly on the United States with forays to Australia and Israel and brief glances at Asia Africa and South America she weaves local stories of drought and pollution together with larger-scale explanations of the worldwide water crisis." where competition for water has a long history (as fans of ���Chinatown�۝ may recall). Fast-growing Las Vegas as it drains nearby Lake Mead contemplates a pipeline to pull water from ranch land in northern Nevada. Conservationists in the San Francisco Bay Area who want to restore rivers and protect fish incur the wrath of farmers in the Central Valley of California and the specter of less snow in the mountains haunts everyone." there is contamination. Tyrone Hayes a biologist shows us mutant frogs their endocrine systems scrambled by pesticide-borne chemicals. Erin Brockovich visits towns with terrifying rates of cancer continuing the work that inspired the Oscar-winning film starring Julia Roberts (a few clips of which are shown). Lynn Henning a Michigan farmer monitors the toxic runoff from lagoons full of cow manure from huge industrial feedlots." we clog the waste stream with empty plastic water bottles and persist in believing that there is a never-ending supply of this essential substance. The calm knowledgeable voices of the experts ��� also including the journalist Alex Prud�۪homme whose book ���The Ripple Effect�۝ is cited as an inspiration in the opening credits ��� make ���Last Call at the Oasis�۝ especially scary. Nothing is more unnerving than predictions of an apocalypse delivered by a reasonable person in friendly conversational tones." and it is a question that always nips at the heels of documentaries like this one. One way the question is answered ��� or perhaps finessed ��� is by the optimistic encouraging tone that tends to sneak in at the end. Most examples of the ���We�۪re screwed�۝ documentary in other words (at least in the American version of the genre) end on a note of ���Yes we can.�۝" where shared water problems have led to cooperation amid otherwise intractable political conflict. There is also a measure of hope to be gleaned from Ms. Yu�۪s interview subjects though less from what they have to say ��� which is pretty grim ��� than from their seriousness and dedication." corporate trickery or plain human stupidity none of them seem inclined to give up. When they do we really will be screwed and we won�۪t have or need movies like this to tell us so." and a few bad words."

�۝ Richard Linklater�۪s gaudily vibrant at times morbidly funny true-crime story takes place in the East Texas town of Carthage which at the time when sweet Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) murdered sour Mrs. Nugent (Shirley MacLaine) had a population of 6 500. To judge from the movie and the Texas Monthly article that inspired it nearly everyone in Carthage loved Bernie including the minister who after the shooting preached that Bernie ���needs to be with God and he needs to know that we are with him.�۝ The preacher didn�۪t say that Bernie needed to be in heaven to be with God. In the movie at least he seems to suggest that Carthage would do just fine." it�۪s no wonder. ���Bernie�۝ grew out of a corrosively comic 1998 article by Skip Hollandsworth that jumps with memorable Carthage facts and flavor: a store called Boot Scootin�۪ Western Wear; a diner sign reading ���You Kill It I�۪ll Cook It�۝; and Cadillacs veering off the road when the wealthy old widows who drive them miss the brakes. This is where Bernie blossomed and would still be in bloom if some had their way. Push past the local color though as Mr. Linklater does and this starts to look like what it was: a sordid bleak tale about two lonely people drawn to each other like colliding planets." Mr. Linklater doesn�۪t lead with the bummer side of the story but instead sets a broad slightly uncomfortable comic tone that makes it difficult ��� intentionally I think ��� to know if you�۪re meant to be laughing or recoiling. (Both are right.) Mr. Black can be an almost insistently demanding presence and the moment he cuts loose in the movie belting out a gospel song as if it�۪s a show tune and then the reverse he pulls you in hard. So it�۪s telling that Mr. Linklater opens the movie with Bernie showing mortuary students how to prettify a corpse. As he stands before his audience he registers as both a director and performer and a bit like a happy Frankenstein reanimating the dead." but almost everything seems improbable about this bouncy child-man. The story slides into place when Bernie motors into Carthage for the first time checking messages on his Jesus-adorned phone. Equipped with a mortuary degree a country smile and a delicate straight-back walk that suggests a prancing pony he lands a job at a funeral home. Because he�۪s equally attentive to the living and the dead he soon becomes an indispensable member of the community whether singing in church or comforting the grieving. The widows take a special liking to him as he solicitously escorts them from their husbands�۪ graves like a gentleman caller holding onto them in case they stumble." the newly widowed Marjorie Nugent. She doesn�۪t stumble ��� not at first anyway. She scowls at him when he later brings her sympathy flowers and grimaces when he shows up with a gift basket. Ms. MacLaine giving her face a strenuous diverting workout squares her jaw and tightly squinches her face as if she were setting a spring trap and waiting for someone to take the bait. She looks battle ready but there�۪s something hunted about Mrs. Nugent too and both the actress and her director make certain you see the cracks in her defense and the woman ��� alone and lonely ��� that Bernie sees." a honeymoon period that Mr. Linklater working with the cinematographer Dick Pope and the editor Sandra Adair gives bright pop momentum. Bernie and Mrs. Nugent start going everywhere and doing everything together. He nudges the widow out of her solitary confinement so that she begins to enjoy what wealth brings including Bernie�۪s attentions. There are lavish trips abroad nights out and lots of nights in as well as side-by-side spa massages. But as Bernie opens her world Mrs. Nugent ��� out of fear spite pathology or plain meanness ��� tries to shrink his until he�۪s in her pocket. He doesn�۪t fit. It isn�۪t long before a district attorney Danny Buck (Matthew McConaughey showboating amusingly) has a case." Mr. Linklater inserts intertitles that announce his thematic categories (���Was Bernie Gay?�۝) and brief interviews (scripted and not) with Bernie boosters some played by actual townspeople. They�۪re textual annotations of a particularly queasy kind and the interviews jump off the screen because these characters let it humorously hang out ��� and man do they love Bernie. These are the town gossips as Greek chorus yet while they�۪re funny sort of there�۪s also something oppressive about these busybodies. They all have a lot to say but in real life when the bad times came and two of their own began flailing these ostensibly comic colorful types were as mute as the stuffed animals that seem to loom from every Carthage wall and make this funny Texas town look like one big taxidermy exhibit."

here we come!�۝ That battle cry prefaces a desperate suicidal run across a fragile bridge by aboriginal warriors to confront the Japanese Army in the Taiwanese historical epic ���Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale.�۝ Its words embody the primitive philosophy of warfare glorified by this unabashedly nationalistic film." ���Warriors of the Rainbow �۝ which cost $23 million is reputedly the most expensive Taiwanese film ever made. The film released in the United States is an abridgement of the original two-part four-hour version." when 300 warriors of the Seediq an aboriginal people centered in Taiwan�۪s interior highlands rose up against their Japanese oppressors. A brief historical preface explains that in 1895 the island of Taiwan was ceded by China to Japan which subdued the native population and turned them into demoralized alcoholic slaves. Steeped in mysticism tribal folklore and Asian machismo the film is a two-and-a-half-hour bloodbath that fetishizes the machete as the ultimate human slicing machine." �۝ that anyone who tried to enter the heavenly hunting ground without blood on his hands would be turned away declares a solemn narrator. The ideal Seediq male Mouna Rudo (Lin Ching-Tai) a tribal chief is a wise fearless warrior who heeds ancient traditions. The youthful Mouna (played by Da Ching) is shown receiving a painful facial tattoo certifying his first decapitation. The ritual makes him a Seediq Bale a hero able to cross a rainbow bridge to the ancestral mountain summit." ���Warriors of the Rainbow�۝ doesn�۪t feel especially visceral. Maybe it�۪s Ricky Ho�۪s wistful swooning music that strongly echoes James Horner�۪s score for ���Titanic.�۝ Maybe it�۪s the rainbows too frequently glimpsed in the region�۪s misty mountains and waterfalls." an abusive Japanese policeman is nearly beaten to death. Mouna Rudo who had advised acquiescence to the status quo is pressured to change his stance. The rebels�۪ first salvo is a massacre at a Japanese sporting event." �۝ ���Warriors of the Rainbow�۝ finds honor in savagery. If its Japanese soldiers repeatedly dismiss the Seediq as ���savages�۝ (the word is usually spat with contempt) the film admires the purity of their rage and their willingness to die in a tribal culture that believes in the cleansing powers of bloodshed." and by the end he is a grudging admirer of Mouna Rudo whose tiny force stands up to the general�۪s well-equipped army of thousands." the pacing of ���Warriors of the Rainbow�۝ is clumsy its battle scenes chaotic and its computer effects (especially of a fire that ravages the Seediq hunting forest) cheesy.

by most accounts in a state of dissipation and despair. ���The Raven �۝ a new movie directed by James McTeigue (���V for Vendetta�۝; ���Ninja Assassin�۝) differs from most accounts by imagining Poe in his final days as a heroic crime fighter tracking down a diabolical serial killer with the tenacious ingenuity of the special agents on ���Criminal Minds.�۝" it seems only fair that he should have a chance to do a little sleuthing of his own. That seems to be the intention of a sadistic murderer whose grisly and ingenious methods are drawn directly from some of Poe�۪s tales. This homage is horrifying to Poe (who is played by a wild-eyed wild-maned and furiously energetic John Cusack) but also perversely flattering. Someone has read the work of this notoriously vain ambitious and competitive writer closely and has been inspired to imitation." Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare. The fannish obsessiveness that animates ���The Raven�۝ is its most appealing attribute and even Poe scholars can forgive it for discarding the biographical record in favor of playful gruesome fantasy. There is a geeky pleasure in matching the on-screen murders to the tales they replicate as in a Gothic version of ���Jeopardy!�۝ ���What is ���The Cask of Amontillado�۪?�۝ ���Who is ���Marie Roget�۪?�۝ ���What is ���The Masque of the Red Death�۪?�۝" old-style television series featuring the writer embroiled in a different one of his own narratives each week. In addition to Poe himself Mr. McTeigue also pays tribute to Roger Corman�۪s Poe adaptations from the early �۪60s the best of which stand as perverse masterpieces of low-budget over-the-top Grand Guignol. There is abundant blood feverish overacting and an atmosphere of hysterical Victorian Americana. Baltimore is envisioned as a city of mist and wet stone dark wood rotted gentility and ambient corruption a place that seems to know that in 150 years or so it will be the setting for ���The Wire.�۝ (The Jimmy McNulty of 1849 is a dogged handsome cop played by Luke Evans.)" and the filmmakers�۪ affection for the boozy wanton world of mid-19th-century print culture ��� for the inky swamp of sensationalistic newspapers and scurrilous magazines from which American literature sprouted ��� is very much in evidence. But if Poe was the drunken tragic bad boy of American letters he was also a meticulous and disciplined craftsman. And it is on this score rather than in matters of biographical detail that ���The Raven�۝ lets him down." I think in the usual mode of constructing a story �۝ Poe writes in ���The Philosophy of Composition �۝ a great mad essay from which young scribblers may still profit. Most writers plod through the ���striking events�۝ of the narrative and fill in the gaps with dialogue description and commentary. ���I prefer commencing with the consideration of an effect �۝ Poe says emphasizing the singular. ���Of the innumerable effects or impressions of which the heart the intellect or (more generally) the soul is susceptible what one shall I on the present occasion select?�۝" �۝ unfortunately does not settle on just one preferring the usual moviemaking practice of multiplying effects until they pile up into a welter of breathless incident and preposterous exposition. Poe�۪s motive in seeking the killer is not just wounded literary pride but also love for his sensible fianc̩e Emily (Alice Eve). (Her grouchy wealthy father is played by Brendan Gleeson.)

�۝ Tom (Jason Segel) is about to propose to his girlfriend Violet (Emily Blunt). He has an elaborate surprise planned and when it is ruined (by his clumsy eagerness and Violet�۪s persistent curiosity) he goes through with it anyway. The romance of the evening is in no way diminished by Violet�۪s knowledge of what�۪s coming and something similar could be said about this movie directed by Nicholas Stoller from a script he wrote with Mr. Segel." and the opening scenes offer an implicit rebuke to the spoiler hysteria that is rampant in online movie discourse these days. In a modern romantic comedy the audience has a pretty good idea of what to expect: a big party; a drive to the airport; a passel of wacky friends siblings and co-workers; classic rock on the soundtrack (this round�۪s on you Van Morrison); at least one scene involving baked goods. Predictability is part of the appeal. ���The Five-Year Engagement�۝ dutifully hits the marks of its genre but it is also about the unpredictability of life and the everyday challenges of love. The sensitivity and honesty with which it addresses those matters is a pleasant surprise." affectionate way of being together that seems to portend a long and happy marriage. But then a bunch of stuff happens ��� including another couple�۪s more urgent wedding and a handful of funerals ��� that delays their nuptials and tests their commitment." a research psychologist wins a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan so Tom an up-and-coming chef leaves behind a promising career in San Francisco to move with her to Ann Arbor. There he finds a job at Zingerman�۪s (an actual delicatessen and pilgrimage spot for Midwestern foodies) and does his best to play the role of loyal and cheerful academic spouse with Violet�۪s colleagues." Kevin Hart and Randall Park. It is good to have them around since the current edition of the rom-com rulebook states that the central couple must not be so idiosyncratic or interesting that they intimidate the audience." to their great credit are funny as well as genial but they are careful here to stake out a middle ground of safe relatability in the midst of all the zaniness around them. They are not as spikily individual as the great warring couples of the screwball era but neither are they as generic as the interchangeable hunks and hotties who flock to the altar every spring in our own anxious cinematic era." our moment in history is also one of comic abundance where hilarious bit players seem to spawn like farmed salmon. ���The Five-Year Engagement�۝ ��� now is the time to note that it was produced by Judd Apatow ��� draws from an especially well-stocked pond." managing to look sad crazy and oddly noble all at once. Brian Posehn shows up as a self-described ���pickle nerd�۝ whose ode to his briny avocation is worth a chuckle even if it has been pre-empted by a similarly themed sketch on ���Portlandia.�۝ (There�۪s a lot of pickle humor abroad in the land these days.) Chris Pratt plays a slightly more on-the-ball version of his happy idiot from ���Parks and Recreation.�۝" Alison Brie who with a British accent and a high-octane goofiness that will astonish those who know her best as Trudy Campbell on ���Mad Men�۝ pretty much steals the whole movie as Violet�۪s fertile impulsive sister." think again; there�۪s also a snowy foot-chase involving Mr. Ifans and Mr. Segel that is pure slapstick delight.) But the film�۪s leisurely rhythm ��� and a more-than-two-hour running time befitting the title ��� allows an unforced earnest reservoir of sadness and frustration to accumulate. The real trouble starts just when it seems that everything is fine." including Drew Barrymore and Justin Long in ���Going the Distance.�۝ In a society ��� or if you prefer in a socioeconomic milieu ��� where work is a primary source of meaning identity and status how do two people reconcile professional ambition with the demands and rewards of a fulfilling relationship? It is certainly possible to raise a feminist eyebrow at the way ���The Five-Year Engagement�۝ ultimately answers this question which is to say with a timid and slightly cynical traditionalism but it is also impossible not to feel genuine sympathy for Violet and Tom and to root for them to work it out." and of some of Mr. Apatow�۪s other recent productions might be ���Comedy Without Cruelty.�۝ Mr. Segel who has grown into America�۪s lumbering puppy-dog heartthrob does not seem to have a mean bone in his body (if indeed he has any bones in his body at all). And Ms. Blunt who also played his inamorata in ���Gulliver�۪s Travels �۝ keeps the claws she flashed so brilliantly in ���The Devil Wears Prada�۝ well hidden." only some of which is deserved. But much of the humor as well as the disappointment and anxiety that shadow the laughs arises from thwarted attempts at kindness. The result ��� not to spoil anything ��� is a very nice movie." yes but also naughty in the usual ways."

�۝ a smart effectively unsettling movie about the need to believe and the hard cruel arts of persuasion. But over time the men and women who meet in a mysterious house in an anonymous Los Angeles neighborhood ��� where they shed their clothes and cleanse their bodies in a ritual ��� are opened up bit by bit wound by wound until they�۪re sobbing and laughing their insides smeared across the carpet." Peter (Christopher Denham) and Lorna (Nicole Vicius) who are clandestinely trying to make a documentary about an apparent cult. The movie opens abruptly ominously in the dead of night with the couple being driven ��� they switch vehicles at one point ��� to a house where a man instructs them to strip shower and change into new clothes. (Peter has a tiny spy camera in his eyeglasses.) They do methodically scrubbing their bodies and then descend into a sparsely furnished basement. There 10 or so similarly dressed people are waiting for what they believe may be salvation in the ethereal form of a willowy young woman Maggie (Brit Marling) who in true star style knows how to make an entrance: veiled and tethered to an oxygen tank." the party begins in earnest. Without her veil and nasal prongs dressed in light loose garments her long blond hair cascading down her back she looks like any number of California girls one of those pretty young women from Kansas or Iowa looking to break into the movies. Maggie is on a different journey and while the detours and destination of her path are vague she makes for a mesmerizing traveling companion ��� or more rightly guide. Because Maggie is the reason that Peter Lorna and the rest are here and she knows it feeds on it. Talking in a soft voice she gives them exactly what they need: attention hope a break from the past a bead on the future. Even as Peter and Lorna keep trying to make their film they�۪re not immune to her." a Madonna or perhaps something else entirely? That�۪s the question that the director Zal Batmanglij and Ms. Marling who together wrote the script keep teasingly open. Peter and Lorna are adamant that they already know the truth at least before Maggie starts boring into their heads (much as the filmmakers try to do with us). Peter is particularly zealous confusing belief with knowledge. Whether he can actually see what�۪s happening inside the basement and out plays into the movie�۪s ideas about the push-pull between reality and the world of appearances. In a nice touch Peter makes a living as a schoolteacher which suggests he isn�۪t exactly an innocent when it comes to indoctrination." when the word ���one�۝ slams on the screen beginning a count that divides the story into 10 sections Mr. Batmanglij gives the movie an appreciable air of unease. Like Peter and Lorna you don�۪t know whether Maggie�۪s the real deal ��� though the better question is what type of deal she is offering. Is she a friend foe fool or just another La-La Land guru peddling transcendence? Ms. Marling raising her voice only occasionally and keeping her gestures largely relaxed makes restraint work for her which fits the movie�۪s increasingly claustrophobic vibe. Maggie erupts only periodically and when she does it�۪s always other people�۪s fault: They are withholding cowardly. One moment she�۪s a caring therapist the next an acting coach and then the personification of a superego." especially in the basement sessions then tying everything together and their big finish while pleasingly surprising is the kind of tricky deus ex machina that needs better finessing. The movie�۪s ambitions are modest but within its narrow parameters ��� with sets that look as if they cost about two bucks and grayish digital visuals that make you yearn for film ��� they create a plausible recognizable world about characters engaged in that most fundamental search: for the meaning of life. Ms. Marling who also starred in and was a writer on the recent independent feature ���Another Earth �۝ another low budget movie that intelligently made the most of its limited means appears to be on her way to figuring out that question."

Regrettably there�۪s less fancy footwork than usual for Mr. Statham (though a crunchy hand-to-hand subway brawl has its delights).

Djbril (Sy Alassane) an aspiring singer and Canal Street peddler may move through a gray-market immigrant world of pirated CDs and sketchy back rooms but everyone and everywhere looks fashion-spread terrific thanks to the serenely muted colors and elegant wide-screen compositions by the cinematographer Bradford Young." a young West African of princely cheekbones and omnipresent sunglasses floating toward us down the street still in transit from music-man dreams to reality." Trini (Sky Grey) from a brothel that his bootleg-supplier Bekay (Tony Okungbowa) runs on the side. We never actually hear Djbril sing though he does manage to pitch laconically to a producer. Trini gets out of prostitution and under the wing of a hairdresser (switching hairstyles along the way) but it seems inevitable that Bekay�۪s unsavory circles will catch up with her or with Djbril." with the filmmakers expressing more than the actors in the tableaus of characters lingering in shots of doorways and rooms or in the crackling air of the street. Mr. Dosunmu a former fashion photographer and music video director and Mr. Young who also shot the lovely-looking coming-out drama ���Pariah �۝ turn Djbril�۪s politely persistent hustle into something almost melancholic while Trini acquires a wounded nobility." but Mr. Dosunmu seems to have directed all his actors to pause before delivering lines giving a languor to the film that comes to feel studied. A nagging inertia grows out of the lack of drama beyond a kind of contemplative tension. When Mr. Dosunmu finally scores a romantic motorcycle ride with opera without achieving the intended soaring effect it�۪s a sign that the movie like its musician protagonist looks very good but has not gone places."

The object of his worship Emil Opffer was a sailor in the merchant marine who spent months at sea while Crane remained in New York pining and jealous." �۝ a fragmentary screen biography of Crane written and directed by James Franco who plays the poet Mr. Franco speaks those words accompanied by images of the Brooklyn Bridge. That is the central symbol in Crane�۪s epic poem ���The Bridge.�۝ There follows an ungainly simulated sex scene between Crane and Emile (Michael Shannon) in which amid much grunting the camera studies the pimples on Mr. Shannon�۪s back. The prosaic encounter is so completely antithetical to the rhapsodic mysticism of Crane�۪s love poetry that you wish another director say Kenneth Anger had taken on Crane as a subject." which was Mr. Franco�۪s New York University master�۪s thesis is based on a biography of Crane by Paul L. Mariani (who also has a small role). Filmed with a hand-held camera in the style of an early Godard movie it is divided into 12 chapters or ���voyages �۝ which flash rudimentarily depicted scenes from Crane�۪s life." he swallows some pills then wanders into a field where he passes out next to a drooling cow. It ends with his suicide at 32 when he jumped off the liner Orizaba in the Gulf of Mexico after having made a pass at a crew member and being beaten up." Crane is shown working miserably in his wealthy father�۪s candy factory; dancing with his mother; reciting his poem ���The Marriage of Faustus and Helen�۝ to an uncomprehending audience; and traveling to Paris where his inability to pay his check at a cafe gets him roughed up by the staff." drunken bar scenes and a tantrum at the New York advertising agency where he worked.

the Norwegian novelist best known for his crime series starring a loose-cannon detective. This relentless new film which does not feature the detective Harry Hole is ostensibly a stand-alone tale unless you count the planned American remake. But its justifiably paranoid protagonist suffers enough punishing twists for two or three movies." for this thriller from the director Morten Tyldum follows one contemporary genre trend by tying case-study psychology to what might be termed extreme fate. Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) a smug corporate headhunter introduces himself in voice-over as all but a walking neurosis: a shorter-than-average supposedly homely man who believes that he retains his statuesque wife only through luxurious upkeep." working with a sleazy partner in crime named Ove.

Greve proves to be a formidable and persistent foe once Brown learns to suspect him and realizes that Greve�۪s unattended Rubens might be a ruse concealing nefarious motives." assuming they could even be plausibly explained are best left unmapped. This nightmarish relentlessness and Brown�۪s viscerally visualized degradation make the typical Hitchcock hero look blessed. Car chases unexpected gunfights and Space Age surveillance all have disastrous outcomes without stopping the story short. Death seems to be a lesser mortal threat to Brown in his perpetual flight than his own all-encompassing fear of Greve�۪s machinations which entangle everyone closest to him." if it�۪s all executed without excuses and Mr. Tyldum�۪s blithe sense of narrative amnesia and absurdity is healthy and appropriate. But the endless pursuit begins to feel a little pointless and even with a couple of false-bottom shocks repetitive." the film is crude and downright sloppy when compared with the clockwork machinations of the Coen brothers�۪ creations as it has been since its premiere. Brown�۪s panic is capably rendered but his ordeals are not worth enduring to the bitter end."

Her husband might deign to make love to her after she cooks a fancy dinner for his boss. All it takes for her to keep the peace is some well-timed flirtatious role-playing. But he has to initiate the amorous reward. Sounds very 1970s doesn�۪t it?" �۝ that supposedly glaring truth becomes clear to Anne (Juliette Binoche) a freelance journalist while she is researching a magazine article about student prostitution. To her shock she discovers that the negative clich̩s about the world�۪s oldest profession may have been wildly exaggerated. Inconveniently the stories the young women tell of their adventures turn her on." �۝ along with the documentary ���Whores�۪ Glory �۝ is one of two films about prostitution released today by Kino Lorber. Beyond their subject they have virtually nothing in common." a Parisian student who advertises herself as Lola and can�۪t afford an apartment without resorting to prostitution usually serving men old enough to be her father. Alicja (Joanna Kulig) an upwardly mobile Polish immigrant who lives with her mother wants a higher standard of living sooner rather than later. The details of their lives remain much too sketchy to provide clear pictures of their circumstances. We don�۪t even know what they want to study or at which school."

Anne�۪s slightest mood swing registers as the deeply felt moment-to-moment experience of a woman whose daily life is portrayed as a series of small frustrations and humiliations (underscored by Beethoven�۪s Seventh Symphony)." high on pot he laughs at his mother when she voices her concerns about his indifference to his studies. Patrick blames Anne for not keeping track of Florent. The younger son St̩phane (Pablo Beugnet) is consumed by video games." intensely erotic soft-core scenes of both Charlotte and Alicja servicing clients and enthusiastically gratifying their kinks.

The attack left him mute unresponsive and suffering from what his psychiatrist Dr. Ilan Kutz described as a severe case of post-traumatic dissociation. When two months of conventional treatment yielded little improvement Dr. Kutz decided to try an outlier therapy: swimming with dolphins at the Dolphin Reef in Eilat on the shores of the Red Sea." the directors Dani Menkin and Yonatan Nir (who is also an underwater photographer at the reef) capture every milestone in Morad�۪s uneasy quest to reclaim his personality and recall his past. Rejecting human interaction Morad comes alive underwater among the gentle animals which offer company and ask for nothing and much of his journey unfolds necessarily from the perspectives of others." for example that a Jewish girlfriend Morad meets at the reef is forced to lie to her family about his ethnicity) interviews with those closest to Morad reveal a young man plagued by post-injury nightmares and sudden rages." �۝ his devoted father tearfully says early in the film.

As Boyd joins forces with other thieves the gang�۪s adventures unspool without suspense or glorification; instead Mr. Morlando�۪s chilly compositions awash in shades of ice and shadow emphasize Boyd�۪s increasingly narrow range of options and air of despondency. This has the unfortunate effect of draining energy from fine performances ��� especially those of Kevin Durand as a fellow criminal and Brian Cox as Boyd�۪s judgmental father ��� and from a central character as desperate for limelight as lucre." ���Citizen Gangster�۝ is a good-looking but passionless affair that remains stubbornly aloof from its audience.

When night falls Seong-jun�۪s friendliness dissolves and after yelling at the students (���Stop copying me!�۝) he literally runs off. He ends up at the home of a former lover Kyung-jin (Kim Bo-kyung) who�۪s reluctant to let him enter. But she relents and before long he�۪s weeping in her lap and the two are in a signature Hong image fumbling at each other�۪s bodies with exquisitely painful awkwardness.

That night the two men and a woman a film professor Bo-ram (Song Sun-mi) end up at a small bar called Novel a nod perhaps to the formal experimentations of this movie�۪s modernist antecedents.

The doubling however marks the point at which ���The Day He Arrives�۝ feels as if it�۪s slipping into another register a different realism ��� subjective rather than nominally objective ��� and what seemed like coincidences and chance repetitions (Seong-jun�۪s meeting of the actress the different goodbyes) appear to be forming a pattern. That night at the bar Seong-jun drinks plays the piano and wonders about Ye-jeon. This won�۪t be their sole encounter: the next evening (or maybe not) he�۪s back at Novel again meeting Ye-jeon and playing the piano." �۝ another movie in which the past collides with the present repetition is both a theme and a narrative device in ���The Day He Arrives.�۝ In ���Marienbad�۝ the repetitions like the recurring traveling shots through all the corridors salons and galleries visually express the characters�۪ mental reality. The repetitions in ���The Day He Arrives�۝ ��� Seong-jun�۪s circular wandering his encounters with the actress the farewells ��� similarly visualize his thought processes and express what he doesn�۪t say or says only obliquely.

His characters wallow but he doesn�۪t and his film feels as light as ���Marienbad�۝ feels heavy. ���The Day He Arrives�۝ has real force and its experimentation is in the service of a moving story about a man who as he says at the start has nowhere to go.

�۝ but the English version ���Goodbye First Love �۝ is an improvement. The movie Ms. Hansen-Love�۪s third feature (after ���All Is Forgiven�۝ and ���The Father of My Children�۝) endows each word of that title with equal weight. It examines with compassion and clarity a young woman�۪s discovery of passion and also of the pain disappointment and partial wisdom that follow." �۝ Camille (Lola Cr̩ton) says to her mother (Val̩rie Bonneton) explaining the voluptuous romantic sadness she wears like a carefully chosen shawl. At 15 Camille is prone to such self-dramatizing statements especially where her boyfriend Sullivan (Sebastian Urzendowsky) is concerned." �۝ she tells her mother and her words to him are even more categorical: ���I�۪ll die without you.�۝ This makes Sullivan uncomfortable. Though he is devoted to Camille there are other aspects of life he wants to embrace with at least equal ardor." who is a few years older than Camille drops out of school to take a journey of self-discovery across South America it is the tragedy of her life. She traces his itinerary with pins on a map hung on her bedroom wall and reads his letters through tears. But at the same time almost unconsciously she steps toward a more independent future working hard in school and discovering the ambition to be an architect." through changes in mood and hairstyle skipping over some important events that are illuminated retrospectively. To say too much about what happens ��� between Camille�۪s parents between her and her Norwegian mentor (Magne-Havard Brekke) ��� would not be to spoil the plot so much as to disrespect the film�۪s wonderfully fresh and surprising rhythm." but it is also true that the experience of moving from youth into relative maturity is always specific and unique. So this is very much Camille�۪s story. Ms. Hansen-Love respects the character too much ��� even when she is silly na��ve or careless ��� to make her a representative figure of female adolescence. The sex lives of young women are often turned into prurient fantasies cautionary tales or both at once. ���Goodbye First Love �۝ like Jannicke Systad Jacobsen�۪s recent ���Turn Me On Dammit�۝ (from Norway) resists the usual urges toward moralism condescension or exploitation." like Camille herself has large ambitions somewhat disguised by an approach that at first looks modest diffident and careful. Ms. Hansen-Love seems to catch life as it happens sometimes in a rush and sometimes with delicious leisureliness (most notably during a brief vacation Sullivan and Camille spend alone at her parents�۪ country house in the Ard̬che region of France). There is nothing ostentatious in this movie and also remarkably nothing false except perhaps some of the hopes of the earnest young couple at its heart." with his dark curls fine cheekbones and sad eyes is a very credible first love while Ms. Cr̩ton uncannily captures Camille�۪s resolution as well as her almost willful vulnerability. ���Goodbye First Love�۝ follows her eager headlong motion toward a point in her life when she can look backward and move on. Within the swift current of time it finds eddies of memory and pools of regret. And when it comes to first love Ms. Hansen-Love suggests goodbye is always au revoir rather than adieu."

The next day according to ���Marley �۝ a riveting two-and-a-half-hour documentary biography directed by Kevin Macdonald he collapsed while running in Central Park. When examined he was found to have inoperable late-stage cancer." whose obsessive drive seems only to have accelerated the more famous he became. He was so immersed in writing that he was said to sleep only four hours a night. Even when gravely ill he displayed a superhuman energy and willpower. Two of his children ��� David a k a Ziggy now 43 and Cedella now 44 ��� remember him as a disciplinarian who was hypercompetitive when they played games. All together he had 11 children from 7 relationships." Rita who performed with his backup singers the I Threes made her peace with his womanizing and acted as his doorkeeper. Marley was not an aggressive sexual predator. A shy man he was besieged with female adoration; women simply fell into his lap." the film is far from a hagiography; and while stocked with musical sequences it is not a concert film. Few if any of his songs are heard all the way through. ���Marley�۝ is a detailed finely edited character study whose theme ��� Marley�۪s bid to reconcile his divided racial legacy ��� defined his music and his life." on the coast of Ghana shows what is called ���the door of no return �۝ through which countless Africans passed on their way to slavery. When he became a star Marley passionately embraced his African roots performing in Gabon (although it was a dictatorship) and at the ceremonies in which Rhodesia became Zimbabwe." Marley was brought up in a tin-roofed shack. He was the son of a young black woman Cedella Marley Booker who had a passing relationship with the much older Norval Marley a British Army man of mixed race who was considered a white Jamaican. (He is seen in the film on horseback in a photograph.)" poor Trench Town district of Kingston where he soaked up music on the radio learned the guitar and found a father figure in Clement Dodd a record producer known as Sir Coxsone who owned a recording studio. Marley was 16 in 1962 when his first single ���Judge Not �۝ set a righteous tone for what was to come." almost by accident reggae evolved out of ska Jamaica�۪s popular dance music of the time. American pop-soul especially the music of groups like the Temptations was also a major influence. Marley and the Wailers�۪ ska rendition of ���A Teenager in Love�۝ from Dion and the Belmonts is heard. Another hybrid fraught with even more significance is ���Selassie Is the Chapel �۝ a rewritten version of the Elvis Presley hit ���Crying in the Chapel.�۝ This version praised Marley�۪s ultimate father figure Haile Selassie the Ethiopian emperor whom Rastafarians regarded as a deity. Mortimer Planno a drummer and Rastafari elder was also an important mentor." Marley and his inner circle maintained a self-disciplined regimen of exercise training and abstemiousness except for marijuana which was considered a sacrament." the British record executive who signed and groomed Marley and the Wailers comes across as a cool cookie who promoted them as ���a black rock act�۝ and created discord after they weren�۪t paid for their work on a grueling promotional tour. Two members quit including Neville Livingston known as Bunny Wailer the movie�۪s most frequent commentator. (He would change his mind and rejoin the group.)" in spreading his global message of ���one love one heart �۝ exhibits a messianic sense of himself. His symbolic importance put him at risk and he narrowly avoided an assassination attempt in 1976. The culmination of his drive to be a peacemaker was his April 1978 One Love Peace concert since called the Third World Woodstock at a Kingston stadium. There he joined the hands of the rival political leaders Michael Manley and Edward Seaga." ���Legend �۝ has sold 25 million copies worldwide and his music and image proliferated at Arab Spring demonstrations.

�۝ I overheard a young woman say to her friend after a screening of ���The Lucky One.�۝ ���It�۪s a Nicholas Sparks movie.�۝ And how. This is the seventh of Mr. Sparks�۪s wildly popular novels to reach the screen and it seems useful in the interests of scholarship to apprehend the ���Nicholas Sparks movie�۝ as a genre unto itself with a distinct set of rules and defining features." someone dies. Usually more than one person and there is also usually a serious illness. The setting is the coastal South ��� typically the Carolinas this time Louisiana ��� a land of lazy waters busy dialect coaches and very few nonwhite faces. A young man and a young woman will fall in love but there will be complications: a rival with a superior pedigree a secret bad weather. Desperate yearning will erupt into urgent kissing ideally in heavy rain (or in this case an outdoor shower under which the smoochers stand fully clothed)." while thick with grief emphasizes redemption and the idea of an inscrutable but ultimately benevolent destiny comes up frequently in the characters�۪ conversations. The sun breaks through the clouds you smile through your tears and your cynicism ��� even the tiny voice in your head crying out ���Wait none of this makes any sense!�۝ ��� is silenced by sweet music (Mark Isham�۪s in ���The Lucky One�۝) and swelling sentiment." like in the one with Miley Cyrus and the baby sea turtles. Sometimes ��� ���A Walk to Remember �۝ for instance starring Mandy Moore the proto-Miley Cyrus ��� there is an emphasis on purity and simplicity. And once so far the synergy of cast director and narrative has brought the genre close to the soaring swooning glory of classic melodrama. That would be ���The Notebook �۝ of course and this is getting a little embarrassing." �۝ then which was directed gracefully enough by Scott Hicks (���Shine �۝ ���Snow Falling on Cedars�۝) from a screenplay by Will Fetters. The film�۪s young man of good heart and modest background ��� we might call him the Gosling ��� is a Marine Corps sergeant named Logan Thibault. Logan has served three tours of duty in Iraq." a fellow barely able to muster sufficient gravitas for ���High School Musical 2.�۝ But this erstwhile teenage heartthrob is reasonably credible all things considered. His biceps are thick his face is covered in rough stubble and his baby blues are fixed in the thousand-yard stare of a man who has seen some terrible things." ���Dear John �۝ and unlike most other commercially ambitious American films in recent years ��� the impact of the last 10 years of war on the lives of many young Americans.

The owner can�۪t be found so he holds onto it and comes to believe that the pretty young woman in the picture and the message on the back (���Stay safe �۝ adorned with a cross) are partly responsible for his survival." traumatized and lonely he decides to seek out his guardian angel and thank her. That he finds the girl ��� walking from Colorado all the way to the bayou with his dog to do so ��� is far from the most incredible thing that happens. And it might in another kind of movie seem a little creepy. Viewed from a slightly different angle ���The Lucky One�۝ is about a troubled stalker in the grip of the delusion that he is linked to his prey by fate." haunted though he may be is thoroughly benign and whatever suspicions Beth (Taylor Schilling) might have when she meets him are dismissed by her wise and salty grandmother (Blythe Danner). They live along with Beth�۪s adorable curly-haired son Ben (Riley Thomas Stewart) ��� the cute kid being another Sparksian axiom ��� in a big beautiful old house and operate a dog kennel on the property." charms Ben and Grandma and chips away at Beth�۪s skepticism. Her ex-husband (Jay R. Ferguson) a sheriff�۪s deputy with political connections and a nasty attitude is suspicious of this handsome newcomer and promises to make trouble for him." since part of the experience of a Nicholas Sparks movie is encountering revelations and reversals in the plot that challenge your sense of the preposterous. That�۪s how destiny works: unlikely incidents pile up good intentions go awry and ��� well see above. If realism is what you�۪re after you�۪ll do better at ���The Three Stooges.�۝ ���The Lucky One�۝ is where you will find death redemption and kisses in the rain." followed by a montage that is kind of steamy by the standards of the genre."

No one seems to have a steady job and there�۪s no shaking the sense of wasted souls in a forsaken sector of society." jumpy cuts ambient lighting fragmented narrative ��� say they do so to approximate reality. The makers of ���Snow on tha Bluff�۝ flip that reasoning. Because the footage is so raw they say the Atlanta police sought it as evidence in some criminal investigations. The director Damon Russell initially coy about what was real and what was scripted now emphasizes that ���Snow on the Bluff�۝ isn�۪t a record of actual events that it�۪s just another lo-fi indie film like ���The Blair Witch Project.�۝ Nothing to see here officer." and he�۪s sticking to it.

Fairly early on he bounds off into the woods and for the next hour or so impressive noncanine cast members search for him acting out various minor relationship dramas as they go." but more plausible explanations might be tact or embarrassment. Let the members of the human pack settle their issues on their own. Dogs have no problem with clich̩s ��� why else would mine bark at the mailman every day? ��� but I suspect that even a patient and loyal hound would tire pretty quickly of the type of shopworn playwriting conventions that litter the ���Darling Companion�۝ screenplay by Mr. Kasdan and his wife Meg." taking a nap or disemboweling a stuffed animal on the living room rug." ���Darling Companion�۝ is not actually unpleasant. Set mostly in and around a lovely Rocky Mountain resort town in the warmer months of the year it is as resplendent with mountain vistas and golden sunlight as a tourist board Web site. This gorgeousness is augmented by the presence of exquisitely selected actors who make reasonably congenial company." Kevin Kline Dianne Wiest Richard Jenkins and ��� in a couple of scenes as a crusty old sheriff ��� Sam Shepard. How can these people fail to be interesting? The answer is that they can�۪t but their collective artistry has the unfortunate effect of exposing the wobbly threadbare platform that Mr. Kasdan has built for them." a long-married Denver couple who have just married off the second of their two daughters. (These young women are played by Elisabeth Moss and a briefly seen Lindsay Sloane)." having served as matchmaker has a prominent role in the ceremony ��� the empty nesters linger at their vacation house with Joseph�۪s sister Penny (Ms. Wiest); her son Bryan (Mark Duplass); and her new beau Russell (Mr. Jenkins). Bryan and Joseph are doctors and they look down on Russell an entrepreneur whose rough manners and improbable business schemes set off their snobbish protective instincts. He can�۪t possibly be good enough for Penny." cracks are starting to show in Beth and Joseph�۪s marriage. He is work-obsessed and arrogant and she needs more time and attention than he is accustomed to providing. Hovering around them all is the stunning caretaker Carmen (Ayelet Zurer) who is gifted with clairvoyance and saddled with lines like ���I am of the Romany people �۝ ���my father was a yogi�۝ and ���my people have a saying.�۝" but I can�۪t print it here. Carmen who has never married because ���no man can keep up with me sexually �۝ flirts hard with Bryan who has a never-seen stereotypically careerist girlfriend back in Denver. Carmen also plays Greek chorus and hand of fate dispatching the others on ambulatory therapy sessions and sending bubbles of New Age wisdom into the mountain air." ���Darling Companion�۝ resembles ���The Big Chill �۝ which Mr. Kasdan also wrote and directed. Once again he gathers a group of nice self-absorbed folks (with Mr. Kline as the flawed sensitive alpha) for a weekend getaway where they will contemplate the passage of time and grapple with their own aging. The stakes seem lower now which is not entirely a bad thing. This film shows no inclination to pose as the portrait of a generation in transition ��� it wants instead to be an insightful group sketch ��� and this modesty is its most becoming feature." the proportions don�۪t feel quite right. A crucial element of subtlety ��� a willingness to let the characters breathe and wander within the small compass of the story ��� is missing and the revelations and reversals that fill out the plot feel glib and obvious rather than incisive. The movie is soft when it wants to be gentle smug when it aims for wisdom and funniest when it is trying hardest not to be. It�۪s friendly sweet harmless and dumb which is to say that if ���Darling Companion�۝ were a dog I would love it without reservation." but nothing that would do them any harm."

�۝ Hong Sang-soo�۪s beguiling new film are preceded by ���Pomp and Circumstance �۝ played over handwritten credits. Elgar�۪s stately march becomes an ironic refrain to the misadventures and regrets of the three recurring characters two men and a woman who navigate different stages in their lives at a film school. The unsubtle musical theme is also a sharp contrast to Mr. Hong�۪s casually brilliant feat of storytelling akin to an ingeniously wrought suite of literary short fiction." both comedic and poignant begins with Jingu (Lee Sun-kyun) a disgruntled film teacher in his 30s as he bickers with his wife over social plans. Jingu belongs to the hapless brotherhood that Mr. Hong has assembled and refined over a 12-movie oeuvre that includes ���Woman Is the Future of Man�۝: young souls blundering through romantic and professional exchanges not yet really where they want to be and through a mix of cluelessness libido and misapplied principles staying there." and at a screening of his own movie is grilled over past personal indiscretions it�۪s hard not to feel a little for his face plants." but what Mr. Hong does with the subsequent segments reconfirms him as one of contemporary cinema�۪s freshest innovators in narrative form restlessly (and meaningfully) exploring point of view and how life does and doesn�۪t add up." Jingu spends his free time relentlessly pursuing a schoolmate Oki (Jung Yu-mi) and plays down an echo chamber of rumors about a filmmaking prize that he might receive as the favored student of the respected Professor Song." reduced by a snowstorm to teaching a class of two starry-eyed pupils (Jingu and Oki) and finally to seeing things through Oki�۪s eyes. With her segment also titled ���Oki�۪s Movie �۝ Oki reflects on her relationships analyzing separate strolls she took with Jingu and Song on the same park path. Mr. Hong an avowed admirer of Fran̤ois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard outdoes himself here neatly upturning our perspective on the vagaries of allegedly grown men." but one of Mr. Hong�۪s qualities underrated of late is a self-effacing yet deeply considered style applied in this movie to episodes as vivid and offhand as journal recollections (perhaps the filmmaker�۪s). A park an anonymous restaurant a street curb serve as quotidian settings for the stories�۪ rendezvous. Bracingly light on scene-setting cues this 80-minute feature gets in and gets out a model of editorial economy by a formidable sketch artist." without tidy explanation and that may be partly why it has taken time for ���Oki�۪s Movie�۝ to find a run in an American theater. But to recall Jingu�۪s words Mr. Hong has found yet another stimulating form for sincerity not to mention irony and insight and it�۪s worth savoring."

Crosby had Hope ��� the foil the fool the flunky the goat. But for much of their career after splitting from a famous straight man the Three Stooges had only one another to kick and slap around. Beginning in the 1930s these immortal three ran amok for decades in some 200 short films busting guts and raking in cash. Now with stupidity a proud national pastime on the boob tube and off the moment is ripe for a nyuk-nyuk revival starting with ���The Three Stooges: The Movie �۝ Peter and Bobby Farrelly�۪s thoroughly enjoyable paean to Moe Larry and Curly and the art of the eye poke." the movie is a fictionalized origin story about three sort-of-lovable fools who could be known as Dumb Dumber and Dumbest as Peter Farrelly originally pitched the movie. It�۪s a perfect fit for the Farrellys who have made a career out of idiocy in comedies like ���Kingpin�۝ and have recently stumbled with duds like ���The Heartbreak Kid.�۝ Written by the Farrellys and Mike Cerrone ���The Three Stooges�۝ imagines a once-upon-an-orphanage time when three babies are tossed out of a speeding car at the feet of a nun whose name Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David in a habit and snarl) announces that the filmmakers won�۪t be soft-pedaling their shtick." whose vulgarity has always been leavened by their sense of decency and too frequently undermined by their sentimentalism. Even so while ���The Three Stooges�۝ has a few aww moments as might be expected given that it�۪s partly set in an orphanage and although the Farrellys go soft on the Stooges�۪ relationships the filmmakers never lose sight of the crude comedy that inspired them. The Stooges�۪ bonds of brotherhood may be strong but they�۪re ties forged by a choreographed roundelay of resonant whacks and other instances of extreme discipline and punishment." divided into ���episodes �۝ follows the Stooges from infancy through childhood to nominal adulthood. By the time they�۪re grown physically if not in any other way Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) Larry (Sean Hayes) and Curly (Will Sasso) are forced to try and save the orphanage from the bad economy and other calamities. Sent out into the world by the Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) with some cash and no worldly experience the Stooges land first in an anonymous city and then in a noir intrigue with a femme fatale Lydia (Sofia Vergara) and her lover Mac (Craig Bierko). Trouble ensues along with a lion a bear (oh my) the handsome guy from the Old Spice commercials (Isaiah Mustafa) and in a sharp funny stroke some of the cast from ���Jersey Shore.�۝" characters like Snooki have assumed the function of a new kind of stooge. In vaudeville the stooge�۪s traditional role was to give the comic something to work off of a straight line or a bit of business. The stooge tripped acted silly feigned being foolish. The new stooge does pretty much the same thing the difference being that reality-television celebrities have turned their lives (or some weird approximation of life) into vaudeville. Of course there�۪s stupid and there�۪s stupid and the real Stooges like the actors playing them in this movie were performing dumbness which pretty much seems the point here." particularly Mr. Sasso. He beautifully captures Curly�۪s facial contortions and vocalizations ��� woo-woo-woo ��� and as important the delicate physicality the fluttering fingers and flapping feet. Topped with Moe�۪s bowl cut Mr. Diamantopoulos bunches his face into a fist and hits his lines like a speed bag (���whatsthemattawithyou?�۝) while Mr. Hayes crowned with Larry�۪s tragically balding Afro and at times sounding like Bert Lahr�۪s Cowardly Lion seems to have more to do than the original Stooge ever did. As usual the Farrellys give this movie about as much visual style as you�۪d find in a Stooges two-reeler but as with the original films you may be too busy watching and laughing at Moe Larry and Curly to care." including from good taste even if their characters tend to put away their freak flags at the end often in the interest of a normalizing romance. Much of the pleasure in ���The Three Stooges�۝ comes from watching and hearing (the boings and thumps are terrific) grown men smack each other silly in Rube Goldberg-like formations and without suffering so much as a single black eye enduring psychological damage or as bad being forced to change. Like Wile E. Coyote and those inflatable clowns that bounce back after every punch the Three Stooges take plenty of hits but keep on coming. They are as the Farrellys understand testaments to human resilience one slap and tickle at a time."

In the film�۪s most moving scene he regales them with one he invented about a chrysalis and a tree that addresses both Martine�۪s suicide and his own recent personal calamity which he is barely able to talk about. Bachir isn�۪t exactly what he claims. In Algeria he was a civil servant who later owned a restaurant but has never taught. Nor is he as he has stated a permanent resident of Quebec.

I�۪m happy to oblige though I worry that it might count as a spoiler even to mention that there are reveals surprises and uncredited performances." one of the producers ��� clearly went to a lot of trouble to put all that stuff in. With compulsive effort that is meant to feel like giddy abandon they have tried to make a horror movie that is frightening original and knowing all at the same time. Two out of three is not bad given the difficulty of the task. A wink can sometimes undermine a scare. Novelty and genre traditionalism often fight to a draw. Too much overt cleverness has a way of spoiling dumb reliable thrills. And despite the evident ingenuity and strenuous labor that went into it ���The Cabin in the Woods�۝ does not quite work." either. Right at the beginning two parallel conceits are set in motion.

I don�۪t want that publicist to come after me with a chain saw." by violence together and the performers inhabit their familiar roles with unusual wit." the revelers are arranged according to well-known types. Or they seem to be: the discrepancies between those assigned identities and other less predictable aspects of their personalities turn out to be part of an elaborate meta-meta-joke. The designated dumb jock (Chris Hemsworth) and the designated dumb blonde (Anna Hutchison) may not actually be all that dumb. The cynical paranoid stoner (Fran Kranz) might turn out to be more sensible than most of his friends. Even the bland nice would-be couple (Kristen Connolly and Jesse Williams both charming) whose survival you are primed to root for are kind of well interesting. Now let�۪s sit back and watch them die!" terrible things begin to happen pretty much on schedule and the two plots begin to converge. Mr. Whitford and Mr. Jenkins provide clues and tongue-in-cheek commentary about the ordeal at the cabin in the woods which they are observing along with a nervous co-worker (Amy Acker) and a skeptical security guard (Brian White)." but of course it is also a reflection of the audience�۪s experience.

There is a scholarly nerdy completist sensibility at work here that is impressive until it becomes exhausting. Not content to toss off just any horror movie Mr. Goddard and Mr. Whedon have taken it upon themselves to make every horror movie.

David Ebersole ���Hit So Hard�۝ largely follows the same rise-and-fall trajectory as a lot of music biopics though its openly sympathetic approach feels rooted in a real friendship rather than in sensationalism or industry boosterism. There�۪s a political angle too because Mr. Ebersole frames Ms. Schemel�۪s story within both a feminist and a lesbian context a move that positions her as something of a leading figure in the history of women in rock." including when she was touring the world with Hole playing before screaming crowds in Japan and Paris and striking poses for Rolling Stone. You see a fair amount of those times both onstage and backstage because when Ms. Schemel wasn�۪t handling a pair of drumsticks she seems to have been carrying a Hi8 video camera. She recorded everywhere ��� in the wings in bed on the bus ��� though given the absence of on-camera drug use not exactly everything. The visual quality of the material she shot is crummy both palsied and smeared but the decrepitude of the images also underscores that these blurry times would soon deteriorate." but they�۪re also real people ��� Mr. Ebersole smartly steers the movie away from the strictly personal. Using talking-head interviews with musicians notably women like Phranc Nina Gordon (Veruca Salt) Debbi Peterson (the Bangles) and Kate Schellenbach (Luscious Jackson) he sketches a story about the American music industry and entrenched sexism that could easily be spun into another documentary. This is Mr. Ebersole�۪s first feature and while he makes some bad choices ��� mostly by overediting and rushing the pace and with showy chapter titles that zip into the frame ��� he tells a significant story about one woman that�۪s more than just hers."

Also: he can act." generally of the more rarefied variety like ���L.A. Confidential�۝ and ���The Hurt Locker.�۝ More recently he has crossed swords and chased terrorists but nothing he�۪s done on the big screen has showcased his talents like the HBO series ���Mildred Pierce �۝ in which he dominated the screen with a memorable combination of pencil mustache class snobbery (���Egads Glendale�۝) and sleazy sex appeal. For ���Lockout�۝ he has shaved the �۪stache and bulked up adding biceps that pop and like his soft purring voice seem calculated to distract from the wanton preposterousness. But then this is a movie in which the daughter of the United States president is taken hostage in a supermax prison ... in outer space. Ridiculousness is a given." �۝ but with digital effects and more tattoos. In that 1981 cult favorite Kurt Russell played a former soldier Snake who�۪s sent to rescue the American president from Manhattan which has been transformed into a maximum-security prison.

Instead of Isaac Hayes Snow faces down a pair of inked psychos (Joseph Gilgun and Vincent Regan)." who wrote the script with Mr. Besson don�۪t just borrow the basic concept from Mr. Carpenter�۪s movie; they also help themselves to some of its flourishes like a subway getaway and a Dick Tracy wrist toy. The filmmakers are fearless when it comes to recycling. In one overly dark and truly terrible digitally rendered chase scene Snow hops on a big-wheeled motorcycle that looks like a rejected prototype from ���The Dark Knight�۝; in another Snow splat-crashes into a window instead of diving through it in an apparent parody of a spectacular stunt from ���The Bourne Ultimatum.�۝ It�۪s funny but also wasted because the gag is deployed too early and there�۪s nothing yet at stake when Snow falls." somewhat like Harrison Ford�۪s character in ���Blade Runner.�۝ Mr. Pearce isn�۪t working in a movie the equal of ���Blade Runner �۝ to underscore the obvious and his character hasn�۪t been given the romantic yearning or substratum of anger much less the mysterious back story that might complicate Snow�۪s disenchantment and jokey asides. Still it can be enough just to watch Mr. Pearce ��� with a shrug a downward glance and a flickering self-amused smile ��� build a character from so little. He�۪s basically going it alone here save for his scenes with the very fine British actor Lennie James (���The Walking Dead�۝) who as a sympathetic supervisor gives Mr. Pearce something to work with and briefly makes this movie more than a solo act."

In the real world Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi ��� played by Michelle Yeoh and referred to as Suu in the movie ��� was elected to Parliament earlier this month one of the latest signs that Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) may be moving in a democratic direction after a half-century of military dictatorship." while it does not include these very recent developments nonetheless angles toward an optimistic conclusion. Stories of heroic self-sacrificing resistance seem to work best if there is at least a provisional happy ending since their common theme is hope in the face of repression and injustice." they are also frequently unsatisfying. Richard Attenborough�۪s noble earnest and finally exhausting ���Gandhi�۝ is perhaps the supreme modern example and while ���The Lady�۝ is nowhere near as lavish or as long it similarly paralyzes history and human drama with relentless hagiography." Aung San a nationalist hero crucial to securing Burma�۪s independence from Britain who was assassinated by rivals in the Burmese army in 1947 when his daughter was a child." except insofar as it represents the empowerment of the bad guys." when most of the action of ���The Lady�۝ takes place. In 1988 Suu returns to Burma from her home in Oxford England to attend to her dying mother. Suu�۪s presence causes discomfort for the ruthless paranoid and superstitious generals who rule the country. They would like to be rid of her but her prominence her international connections and the reluctance to create another martyr like Aung San prevent them from using the usual violent methods. Instead Suu is invited to leave the country and then when she refuses is placed under a house arrest that will stretch in various forms over two decades." but it also threatens to constrain his restless visual energy. A glance at his previous work as a director ��� it includes ���La Femme Nikita �۝ ���The Fifth Element�۝ and ���Leon: The Professional�۝ ��� confirms that this is not a filmmaker with a gift for standing still or moving slowly and he seems a bit at sea in a narrative that is above all a celebration of heroic patience. The chronology lurches back and forth as Mr. Besson tries to turn Suu�۪s stubbornness into an engine of dramatic momentum." Suu is not alone in ���The Lady.�۝ While it is a chronicle of political courage the film is also a love story illuminating the remarkable relationship between Suu and her husband a British academic named Michael Aris. Played by David Thewlis Michael is in some ways a more vivid character than the serene indomitable Suu whose international fame traps Ms. Yeoh in biopic nobility. Michael floppy haired and wry is a classically eccentric don with a very British stiff upper lip. He is devoted to Suu and to her cause successfully promoting her candidacy for a Nobel Peace Prize and trying less fruitfully to outwit the Myanmar authorities who are keeping them apart." though relatively late in the period it spans. (Mr. Aris died at 53 in 1999.) And yet the movie�۪s unstinting commitment to emphasizing their goodness ��� the evident awe in which Mr. Besson and the screenwriter Rebecca Frayn hold their subjects ��� has the effect of blunting the impact of their story." but no inkling of doubt or tension is allowed to penetrate the aura of idealistic selflessness that shrouds Suu and Michael. And somehow the audience is never permitted to appreciate the depth and profundity of their shared commitment to Myanmar. Similarly while the movie shows the brutal treatment of Suu�۪s colleagues in the human rights movement it does not explore the struggle discipline and internal friction that are essential to successful political resistance. One result is a film that is programmatically inspirational but not quite as inspiring as it should be." more implied than shown."

This actor�۪s quiet watchful manner makes him both intriguing and inscrutable even as Mario is so unassuming as to be virtually invisible. He has an evident kinship with Ra̼l the delusional sadistic weirdly sensitive Everyman whom Mr. Castro portrayed in ���Tony Manero �۝ Mr. Larra�_n�۪s 2008 film set in the early years of Gen.

All decent human sentiment that is not suppressed outright seems to have been perverted. Mario�۪s behavior toward Nancy represents his version of chivalry but it is also undeniably creepy and a scene of them weeping at his kitchen table is less a moment of empathy than of bizarre unnerving desperation observed with a detachment that borders on cruelty." to judge or to explain Mario�۪s behavior and Mr. Castro gives away very little about his character�۪s inner world except to signal that it is not a particularly nice place.

Martin rouses Lucy out of her depression in almost no time and the four become a family of sorts. If ���The Hunter�۝ were a product of Hollywood the two would become romantically involved. But the movie resists pushing the usual buttons." he is presumed to be a tree-hugging ���greenie �۝ intent on destroying their livelihood.

Tense standoffs between Martin and the loggers who pay an unannounced visit to Lucy�۪s house one evening are charged with menace. It is strongly suggested that they may have killed Jarrah." the hunter-prey contest is insignificant compared with the film�۪s allegorical contemplation of opposing forces: the promises and illusions of technology survival versus conservation the meaning of extinction in the age of cloning and ultimately the mystery of the past versus the uncertainty of the future."

Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown and so too the miter. What haunts Mr. Moretti�۪s character is whether he can embrace his role as pontiff." if not necessarily those you might expect from Mr. Moretti. (The film�۪s English title suggests auctions and game shows while the Latin original ���Habemus Papam �۝ comes wreathed in incense-perfumed mystery.) An Italian leftist best known for films like ���Caro Diario�۝ and ���The Son�۪s Room �۝ he has said that he isn�۪t a director but one who makes movies ���when he has something to say.�۝ At times what he has to say is overtly political as in ���Aprile �۝ when he implores comically desperately a tongue-tied opponent of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi who is monopolizing a TV show to ���say something answer say something left wing say something even not left wing something civilized.�۝" �۝ which opens with unidentified news images from the funeral of Pope John Paul II. The ceremony and the sight of thousands of bodies pressing into St. Peter�۪s Square instantly shifts the movie into a serious register that continues when Mr. Moretti cuts to lines of chanting old men in red presumably the College of Cardinals entering what looks like the Vatican. It�۪s all very exotic and solemn or would be if the cardinals didn�۪t then pass a scrum of reporters who separated from the clerics by ropes and stanchions look as if they were covering the red carpet at the Oscars. ���Cardinal �۝ demands one TV journalist thrusting a microphone at the clerics ���could we have a statement?�۝" but with this scene Mr. Moretti with characteristic efficiency makes his own quiet statement about the connections among religion spectacle and the media. These associations have already been implied in the opening funeral images but Mr. Moretti�۪s touch is so light here that it feels as if he�۪s making an offhand observation about the church instead of building an argument. (He�۪s doing both.) And so it goes as the cardinals gather in the Sistine Chapel (by way of Cinecitt�� Studios) and after a few ballot rounds select Melville. As the faithful wait for him publicly to acknowledge his new role an openly uneasy increasingly unsure Melville hesitates and then abruptly runs off seemingly leaving his flock hanging." wearing civilian clothing and still an unknown to the outside world doesn�۪t abandon the faithful but walks among their numbers at first with some confusion and then with mounting confidence and openness. In Rome stores and on buses he discovers people ��� notably some of his first encounters are with gently ministering women ��� whose humanity helps awaken something human in him. Mr. Piccoli a giant of European cinema brings dignity to the role and an innocence that�۪s less childlike than unworldly. As he awkwardly navigates through Rome�۪s streets and stumbles into the chaos of its traffic his body lurching and stumbling and sometimes almost toppling over Melville seems as confused as a stranger or perhaps just a man newly awakened from a dream." and in truth there�۪s something so unforced about ���We Have a Pope�۝ that its assertion of papal humility and humanity rather than infallibility might be easy to miss. But it�۪s there tucked in a story about a pope who describes himself with bittersweet self-knowing as an actor and meets a troupe rehearsing Chekhov�۪s ���Seagull.�۝ The Chekhov underscores Melville�۪s disappointment in his life and also works as a melancholic counterpoint to the volleyball matches at the Vatican arranged by a psychiatrist (Mr. Moretti) who�۪s been hired to guide the pope through his crisis. Mr. Moretti finds broad comedy in the antics of some clerics who can seem as sweet as children but in Melville there is pathos and there is tragedy and not his alone."

So little is revealed about the policeman�۪s marriage that its fate is negligible and even more damaging we learn almost nothing about the terrorists or their endangered hostages whose almost two-day ordeal must have offered a wealth of plotlines. In place of emotional stakes we get gleaming stylized occasionally slow-motion violence filmed in such extreme close-ups and cramped spaces that it�۪s impossible to differentiate gunman and victim." and the incorporation of some of this footage gives the climax punch. Even so this very authenticity underscores the trickiness of repurposing real-life tragedy as mass entertainment leaving ���The Assault�۝ no more than a handsome ruthless charge to a bloody unearned finale."

�۝ as people sometimes do in New Yorker cartoons. Its assembly of experts is far too smart and savvy too heavily armed with facts figures and the legacy of the Enlightenment to be dismissed as random kooks well except by their political and ideological critics. Even so this 86-minute breeze through civilization its history and self-made discontents from the Canadian filmmakers Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks ��� which concentrates on the present and future costs of familiar environmental and economic catastrophes ��� is very much a doomsday documentary." �۝ which as the name announces is an exceedingly compressed examination of human times from the Canadian novelist and historian Ronald Wright. (The American paperback runs 211 pages 53 of them for notes.) Specifically the book charts the rise and fall of societies ��� in the Stone Age on Easter Island the Romans and the Maya ��� seeing a cautionary tale about progress in their successes and declines. In the Old Stone Age to take one bleak example humans so perfected their hunting tools and techniques like running a herd of mammoths over a cliff instead of spearing a few for dinner that they drove their prey into extinction. The geoscientist Paul S. Martin called this extinction theory the overkill hypothesis." �۝ as its some two dozen talking-head interviews make distressingly clear. Among the more famous of these heads are the primatologist Jane Goodall the physicist Stephen Hawking and the writer Margaret Atwood who�۪s the subject of another new documentary ���Payback �۝ about debts and their fallout. Among the most informative are the blunt-speaking economist Michael Hudson and the fast-talking energy expert Vaclav Smil who�۪s minimized the importance of global warming in the past but here mainly discusses consumption stating ���We have to use less.�۝ In a nice personal touch Mr. Smil singles out the high price of renovating a bathroom an example he says with a smile drawn from his own life." often persuasive and surprisingly calm and collected for folks discussing the end of the world as we know it. It�۪s too bad though that the most of these talking heads are male and from North America (or Europe) an observation that has nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with the movie�۪s topic. Environmental and economic calamities never remain geographically confined as the filmmakers detail in sections that focus if superficially on China Africa and South America. However eloquent inhabitants of these parts of the world are underrepresented and at times badly represented as with a Chinese tour guide who adds only an unhappy caricature to the mix." but the documentary hews pretty much to the same story line: We�۪re doomed doomed doomed. Midway through the movie I scribbled ���I feel very depressed�۝ in my notebook a confession that says something about me but also gets at the documentary�۪s successes and failures. Zippily edited and nicely photographed ���Surviving Progress�۝ is a fine summary of a hot ugly mess. But like too many short documentaries it can�۪t do justice to its complex topic or finally to those of us watching. Because while ���Surviving Progress�۝ puts forth a lot of general advice (stop the deforestation of the Amazon) it offers little in terms of real practical graspable solutions. People need hope; moviegoers do too."

�۝ Maggie Hadleigh-West�۪s volatile documentary is subtitled ���A Love Story �۝ but it�۪s really a tragedy: a tragedy that the hair-trigger energy and ambition of the young men in front of her camera have so few legal outlets. And a tragedy that almost all of them most in their early 20s would not think of stepping outside their homes without life insurance." Brooklyn Ms. Hadleigh-West the self-confessed descendant of ���a long line of white Southern racists �۝ explores thug life through the eyes of the aspiring hip-hop artist Half-a-Mill (born Jasun Wardlaw). Baby-faced and with the pragmatism of a dedicated survivor Half-a-Mill ��� whose childhood band of 30-odd friends has dwindled to a handful of scarred adults ��� expounds on the Darwinism of the housing projects and the fragility of an existence dependent on crime." �۝ he says shrugging knowing that hunger is the great motivator. Following Half-a-Mill and his ragtag entourage during the six months leading up to the release of his first album ���Player Hating�۝ (the phrase describes the act of envying someone else�۪s success) is a sad chronicle of absent fathers and messed-up mothers drugs as currency and violence as the period at the end of every argument. Hammering the point home a black screen with ���Rest in Peace�۝ in white letters interrupts the film�۪s narrative all too often tagging the end of lives barely begun." Ms. Hadleigh-West�۪s chaotic on-the-fly shooting style opens a portal to an alien land a corner of America where many whites fear to tread. In contrast to the approach she took in her confrontational 1998 documentary ���War Zone �۝ she stays mostly in the background making no apologies for her subjects�۪ off-screen crimes. Rather like the best interviewers she holds her shots for several seconds after someone has ceased talking knowing that silence like an empty belly demands to be filled."

American military officials realized that they were going to need a substantial number of soldiers who could speak and read Japanese. They recruited Nisei second-generation Japanese-Americans who filled a wide range of roles including translating captured documents and going ashore in places like Okinawa to try to persuade captured Japanese not to kill themselves. As the historian James C.

hunkered down and waiting for the cops. There are ghosts upstairs rattling their chains. But ���Keyhole�۝ is not really a gangster picture nor a horror movie though it traffics in some of the visual and verbal conventions of both genres: tough talk murky shadows darkened hallways. The simplest way to describe it is as a Guy Maddin film which is really just a way of gesturing toward its puzzles and complications." inspired by ���The Artist�۝ and ���Hugo�۝ and ���Midnight in Paris �۝ among others. Mr. Maddin�۪s obsession with the movie past long predates those efforts. His black-and-white silent films (including the features ���Dracula Pages From a Virgin�۪s Diary �۝ ���Cowards Bend the Knee�۝ and ���Brand Upon the Brain!�۝ and a bouquet of marvelously kinetic shorts) are more radical and more rigorously authentic than ���The Artist.�۝ He uses old styles and technologies not as a cute retro gimmick but rather to explore persistent themes of memory and loss." bracing for a police raid pass the time conspiring complaining flirting with the boss�۪s mistress and dabbling in interior decoration. Ulysses arrives carrying a young woman named Denny (Brooke Palsson) whom he has apparently saved from drowning. He is preoccupied with caring for her and also with a young man gagged and bound with ropes who turns out to be his son Manners (David Wontner)." Hyacinth (Isabella Rossellini) is somewhere on the upper floors attended by her lover and the specter of her father. Like his Homeric namesake Ulysses is seeking a way back to his wife though there is not much evidence of love or loyalty between them. Nor is ���Keyhole �۝ narratively speaking a reimagined ���Odyssey�۝ any more than it is a �۪30s crime drama. It�۪s more like a dusty attic full of battered evocative cultural references. You might detect the shades of Ibsen�۪s ���Ghosts�۝ and Henry James�۪s spooky Victorian tales or find other echoes and glimmerings to parse with your friends after the movie." amid the mannered performances the comically overwrought voice-over (���Remember Ulysses!�۝) and the smoky silvery cinematography (by Benjamin Kasulke) a kernel of surprising and scary emotion. In some of Mr. Maddin�۪s other work there is more than just a kernel. Beyond their formal brilliance it is the psychological anguish of ���Brand Upon the Brain!�۝ and the layered melancholy of ���My Winnipeg �۝ Mr. Maddin�۪s 2008 ode to his hometown that make those films so lastingly powerful and strange." �۝ which was commissioned by the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University represents something of a departure even as its weird almost-familiar monochromatic images are stamped with Mr. Maddin�۪s unmistakable sensibility. It is his first digitally shot feature and it is also less personal and more accessible than some of his other work. To a die-hard Maddinite this may be a little disappointing but for that reason ���Keyhole�۝ may also be a perfect gateway into the bizarre and fertile world of a unique film artist."

for sure and also some of the lads identified in the opening titles as ���their distress�۝ ��� speak in complete sentences and express complex sometimes startlingly original ideas. This friends is news: a movie populated by young people who do not mumble swear punctuate their utterances with ���like�۝ or think that an incredulous ���really?�۝ represents the apogee of wit. Even if it did not have other charms this peculiar uneven campus comedy would be worth seeing for the delightful felicity of its dialogue." who is 60 might be accused of idealizing some of the student body of Seven Oaks College a venerable prestigious and imaginary institution but he is wholly innocent of the greater sin of condescension. The manners and morals of fledgling members of the privileged class have always interested this director who made three sweet astringent comedies in the 1990s before receding into a much remarked-upon now thankfully concluded obscurity." ���Metropolitan�۝ (1990) was set in the vestigial but still vigorous world of oldish New York money (the ���urban haute bourgeoisie �۝ as one earnest preppy memorably puts it). That was followed by ���Barcelona�۝ (1994) and ���The Last Days of Disco�۝ (1998) which pursued the same kind of articulate self-conscious well-bred people into the strange worlds of Spain and Manhattan nightlife." �۝ he has come full circle returning to the romantic travails of ruling-class late adolescence. But the world has changed ��� perhaps more than some of us have realized ��� and ���Damsels in Distress�۝ is remarkable for feeling both exquisitely observant and completely untethered to any recognizable social reality." that the occasional outlandishness of the film arises not because Mr. Stillman is out of touch with the way things are but rather because he wants them to be different and avails himself of the artist�۪s prerogative to make them that way. You can despair of the state of civilization or decide in spite of abundant evidence to the contrary that its codes and customs still exist and that you will defend them. ���Build therefore your own world �۝ Ralph Waldo Emerson instructed the youth of 1837. Mr. Stillman does just that even if his world is grounded in the counter-Emersonian values of tradition and conformity." Violet Wister (Greta Gerwig) is a marvelous paradox. She is stubbornly self-invented ��� her name is not really Violet and she does not seem to belong by birth to the caste whose behavioral norms she espouses ��� and at the same time profoundly hostile to individualism. Perhaps like her creator she is a deeply idiosyncratic conservative a believer in propriety and continuity standing athwart history and saying ���Not so fast.�۝ Her staunch defense of the college�۪s ���Roman letter�۝ fraternity system is based on some curious logic. She reasons that the clubs cannot be accused of elitism because their members are ���morons �۝ a belief in the alignment of status and intelligence so na��ve that it might almost make you weep." Heather (Carrie MacLemore) and an ambivalent latecomer named Lily (Analeigh Tipton) ��� see themselves as missionaries. They run the campus suicide prevention center providing doughnuts and dance classes for their gloomy schoolmates and they date frat boys out of a combination of pity and civilizing zeal. It is better to date losers than cool guys Violet says because the love of a superior woman can lift a mediocre man toward better things. This is a very old (not to say retrograde) idea and also perhaps a succinct explanation of recent trends in American film comedy." while another ��� Violet�۪s erstwhile boyfriend Frank (Ryan Metcalf) ��� has the spelling ability of a kindergartner and the attention span of an even younger child." but preferred�۝ spelling) are what Rose in her clipped British accent calls ���playboys and operators.�۝ One of these might be a fellow named Charlie (unless his name is Fred; in either case he is played by Adam Brody) who appears to take a romantic interest in both Violet and Lily. Lily meanwhile has a complicated relationship with a French graduate student named Xavier (Hugo Becker)." Mr. Stillman�۪s attitude toward female sexuality treads the border between chivalry and squeamishness. There is some discreet discussion of the erotic habits of the Cathars a heretical French sect whose favored practice (at least according to Xavier) is more usually associated with the citizens of Sodom in the Old Testament. But reticence rules the universe of ���Damsels in Distress.�۝ It is not that sex is denied or repressed exactly but rather that bodily desires are ultimately less consequential than more exalted longings chief among them the yearning to figure out the world and one�۪s place within it." Lily and Violet the two contrasting damsels ��� one bony and brown-haired the other big-boned and blond; one a questioning skeptic the other a true believer ��� wander and ruminate. Neither the film nor its characters seem to be in any particular hurry and there are times when the plot wobbles and slows like a weakly spun top." for instance ��� rubs awkwardly against some of the sharper satirical insights. The musical score by Mark Suozzo and Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne) evokes a bad television movie from the 1980s and its deployment is as haphazard as the pacing and juxtaposition of the scenes. The actors often lack direction both in the sense that they do not seem to have been instructed in how to play their roles and also in the more literal sense that they do not always appear to know which way to walk or how fast." en route from Noah Baumbach�۪s ���Greenberg�۝ to Woody Allen�۪s ���To Rome With Love �۝ has some of the discipline that Mr. Stillman lacks. Violet is very much an intellectual construct: an ardent bluestocking who cuts against the grain by opposing the impulse to be different. But Ms. Gerwig also makes her a complicated sympathetic and ridiculous human being able to speak her mind clearly even when her inner and outer life threaten to become hopelessly muddled."

there are teenagers in this great country who respond to intrinsically hilarious phrases like ���band camp �۝ ���Stifler�۪s Mom�۝ and ���Eugene Levy�۝ with blank uncomprehending stares. The arrival of ���American Reunion�۝ is no doubt partly intended to remedy this alarming cultural deficit and also to remind former teenagers of jokes that used to make them laugh." this latest installment in the ���American Pie�۝ franchise ��� the fourth to be released in theaters and the first since ���American Wedding �۝ way back in 2003 ��� asserts a claim of paternity or at least big-brotherhood. You know all those raunchy regressive comedies about a bunch of dudes driven to excessive partying by their hysterical fear of women and their panicky half-awareness of their own homoerotic impulses? (If you don�۪t you must not see many movies.) Well ���American Pie�۝ invented that whole thing! O.K. not really. Back when I was a teenager there was ���Porky�۪s �۝ but we can talk about that some other time." at the turn of the century what it was to be ���American�۝ have grown older. (The original filmmakers the screenwriter Adam Herz and the director Paul Weitz have moved on bequeathing the franchise to the ���Harold & Kumar�۝ auteurs Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg.)" the five main male characters have settled into various versions of adulthood except for Stifler (Seann William Scott) who still lives with his mom (Jennifer Coolidge) and still fits into his ���Orgasm Donor�۝ T-shirt in spite of having bulked up a bit en route to his 30s. Oz (Chris Klein) is a semi-celebrity with a sports talk show on basic cable a big house in Los Angeles and a hot young girlfriend (Katrina Bowden). Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are still around. Finch has a motorcycle and Kevin has a wife who likes reality television. Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are still married though parenthood has put a damper on their famously torrid and inventive sex life." Mich. for the big event Kevin runs into his old flame Vicky (Tara Reid) and Oz runs into his first love Heather (Mena Suvari). Ms. Suvari is notable for having appeared in two movies released in 1999 with ���American�۝ in the title. If you can�۪t remember the other one count yourself lucky." and Mr. Levy once again steals the show with overexplicit (but unimpeachably sensible) parental advice. There�۪s a little new blood ��� or rather new flesh ��� in the person of Ali Cobrin playing Kara a high school senior who throws herself at Jim her former baby sitter. Her lust makes Jim uncomfortable but her willingness to take off her clothes allows ���American Reunion�۝ to earn its R rating and to uphold the dreary tradition of aggressive leering followed by anxious moralistic slut-shaming." a stew of lechery revulsion longing and sheer childish terror ��� and that�۪s just the guys. Female sexuality remains a source of confusion. Much as the boys slobber and gawk nothing scares them more than a woman who actually seems to want to go to bed with one of them." to its credit allow some exceptions to this rule ��� Michelle�۪s happy unapologetic lust in particular ��� and its nastiness has always been softened by Jim�۪s neurotic sweetness. In this movie an obnoxious youngster derisively calls him ���Adam Sandler �۝ and the joke underscores an important contrast. Mr. Sandler characteristically turns his insecurity into aggression; he�۪s a bully pretending to be an underdog. But Mr. Biggs has always been willing to risk embarrassment and to display vulnerability ambivalence and decency as well as his backside and his privates." ���American Reunion�۝ is sometimes awkward and uncomfortable caught between nostalgia for the old days and relief that they are gone forever. It has some good moments but it goes on too long and not enough happens that is likely to create new memories. Remember ���American Pie�۝? If you do this movie is redundant and sad. If you don�۪t it�۪s irrelevant."

Japanese comic books or manga typically celebrate vampire-hunting beauties or feisty schoolgirls tentacled monsters or technology-crazed teenagers. But to the graphic artist Yoshihiro Tatsumi and his peers in the late 1950s they offered an opportunity to explore darker more sophisticated stories about postwar Japan ��� stories so adult that they required a brand-new name: gekiga." �۝ the director Eric Khoo incorporates five of these stories all written in the 1970s into an animated tribute that seeks to vivify this artist�۪s controversial fearless work. It�۪s potent stuff delving into pornography incest murder and mutilation in the company of alienated men and unhappy sometimes cruel women. Resonating with the deeply felt shame of a lost war (Mr. Tatsumi was 10 when the atom bomb fell on Hiroshima) these twisted and often touching tales express their author�۪s rage at a booming economy that failed to lift every boat." �۝ he tells us in the mostly gentle narration that accompanies the film�۪s biographical segments excerpted from his autobiography ���A Drifting Life.�۝ Rendered in rather wishy-washy pastels these segments offer only broad personal details including how he drew comics at a young age to support his poor family and dealt with the envy of his sickly brother." the moody mostly black-and-white samples of his art have a tough urgency that leaps from the screen: from the harrowing first story set in a razed Hiroshima to the closing tale of a prostitute who has been betrayed one too many times they mold pulpy drama and moral complexity into a transfixing whole. Capturing the mood of a troubled time ���Tatsumi�۝ is a fine if frustratingly indistinct portrait of an artist ripe for rediscovery."

it also lurks in dark corners including those dimmed by your own imagination. The Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo knows that cinema is like campfire tales and radio shows once were a wonderful training ground. The movies are where many of us first learn to shudder at creaking floorboards slow-turning doorknobs and all the other delicious familiar frights that repeatedly bring us back for another genre helping. Horror stories in other words teach you how to be afraid and how to conquer your fear which turns out to be the deft amusing moral of this one." �۝ using shadows and directorial sleights of hand to coax forth its slow-building scares rather than just pouring on the usual guts and gore. This restraint is especially welcome given that his last outing as a director was ���28 Weeks Later �۝ the disappointing bludgeoning sequel to Danny Boyle�۪s excellent zombie movie ���28 Days Later.�۝ For ���Intruders�۝ Mr. Fresnadillo has slowed the pace dimmed the lights and trained his camera on the faces of characters you may actually want to see make it out alive and in one piece unlike the disposable young things of many contemporary horror flicks whose idiocy and one-dimensionality almost beg for your sadism." ���Intruders�۝ opens quietly in Spain where a young single mother Luisa (Pilar L�_pez de Ayala) is cuddling her only son Juan (Iz��n Corchero) a boy of around 8 just before bedtime. Juan likes to invent scary stories and that evening as a storm kicks up and his cat goes missing (bad bad kitty) those tales seem to take literal shape with the appearance of a ghoul Hollow Face. As Juan watches horrified and Mr. Fresnadillo smartly steeps the scene in shadows Hollow Face ��� its features obscured and black clothing swirling like tendrils of seaweed ��� slithers up the building for a home invasion. The monster came through the window Juan later tells his mother who shushes away his fears but fails to keep Hollow Face from returning." where a builder John Farrow (a dependably appealing Clive Owen) lives with his wife Sue (Carice Van Houten) and daughter Mia (the very good Ella Purnell). Despite a near-fatal fall at John�۪s work ��� and another portentously prowling cat ��� nothing seems off about the Farrows until Mia begins talking about Hollow Face. What begins as childish fun soon becomes as with Juan the stuff of family nightmare because Mia seems to be narrating Hollow Face into existence. The more she speaks of the ghoul the more real it becomes until it�۪s hovering in the gloom of her bedroom and forced her off the deep end where she�۪s soon joined by her father. Night after night the monster returns haunting children and parents in different homes." namely in the form of a young priest Antonio (Daniel Br�_hl) John turns to the police and surveillance technologies. These mirrored solutions appear equally dubious and bring with them another nice doubling in the form of an old priest who labels Luisa crazy and a therapist (Kerry Fox) who says the same of John. Although Mr. Fresnadillo�۪s toggling between the two families initially feels overly brusque and narratively unearned the connective tissue between their stories (like the priest and therapist) thickens until it all feels of a piece which of course it is. And while the sympathetic Mr. Owen and Ms. Purnell encourage you to worry more about one family Mr. Fresnadillo and his love of the dark keep you jumping no matter where you are." this is PG-13 territory."

�۝ Lee Hirsch�۪s moving and troubling documentary about the misery some children inflict upon others arrives at a moment when bullying long tolerated as a fact of life is being redefined as a social problem. ���Just kids being kids�۝ can no longer be an acceptable response to the kind of sustained physical and emotional abuse that damages the lives of young people whose only sin is appearing weak or weird to their peers." it is also about ��� and part of ��� the emergence of a movement. It documents a shift in consciousness of the kind that occurs when isolated oppressed individuals discover that they are not alone and begin the difficult work of altering intolerable conditions widely regarded as normal." in some ways a cause of it since it is almost always socially isolated children (the new kid the fat kid the gay kid the strange kid) who are singled out for mistreatment. For some reason ��� for any number of reasons that hover unspoken around the edges of Mr. Hirsch�۪s inquiry ��� adults often fail to protect their vulnerable charges." a 14-year-old in Sioux City Iowa whose daily routine includes being teased humiliated and assaulted (especially on the school bus) cannot bear to tell his parents what is going on. He even sticks up for his tormenters who he says are ���just messing around�۝ when they stab him with pencils and call him vile names." what friends do I have?�۝ he asks his distraught confused mother." one eagerly obliges with a smile and an apology. The other sullenly resists and as she scolds him for his noncooperation (letting his antagonist go) it becomes clear that this boy is the victim and that the assistant principal�۪s rushed attempt to be fair is in fact perpetuating a terrible and continuing injustice." after this same well-meaning clueless educator has similarly mishandled a meeting with Alex�۪s parents ��� showing them pictures of her grandchildren; chirpily insisting that the bus where Alex has been terrorized is ���good as gold�۝ ��� Alex�۪s mother says ���she politicianed us.�۝" though Mr. Hirsch�۪s camera does capture a few horrifying episodes (one of them so alarming that he shared it with parents and school officials). In spite of its title the film is really about the victims their parents and the powerful grown-ups who let them down." in spite of the suicide of Tyler Long a 17-year-old student who took his life after enduring years of harassment and ostracism. A sheriff in Yazoo County Miss. tallies with dry bureaucratic relish the 45 felony counts faced by Ja�۪Meya Jackson a 14-year-old girl who pulled out a gun on a crowded school bus. Nothing can justify such a crime he says." but his insistence on a narrow legalistic understanding of Ja�۪Meya�۪s case betrays a profound lack of concern about the sustained and systematic abuse that she experienced at the hands of her schoolmates." Ty Smalley�۪s suicide left behind loving parents and a devoted best friend a self-described former bully whose insights are among the most accurate and devastating in the movie." a high school student in another part of Oklahoma came out as a lesbian she and her family were shunned by neighbors and former friends and Kelby was taunted by teachers as well as fellow students." and he wisely refrains from making scapegoats of the bullies who cause Alex Ja�۪Meya Tyler Ty and Kelby so much pain. ���Bully�۝ forces you to confront not the cruelty of specific children ��� who have their own problems and their good sides as well ��� but rather the extent to which that cruelty is embedded in our schools and therefore in our society as a whole." a more explicit discussion of how the problem of bullying is connected to the broader issues of homophobia education and violence in American life. But those issues are embedded in every story the film has to tell. Its primary intent is to stir feelings rather than to construct theories or make arguments and its primary audience is not middle-aged intellectuals but middle-school students caught in the middle of the crisis it so powerfully illuminates." it should be noted that the Motion Picture Association of America�۪s ratings board by insisting on an R rating for ���Bully �۝ has made it harder for young audiences to see. The Weinstein Company which is distributing the film has released it without a rating after the association denied its appeal and after a widely publicized petition drive was unable to change the board�۪s mind." and a lot of upsetting stuff but while some of it may shock parents very little of it is likely to surprise their school-age children. Whose sensitivity does the association suppose it is protecting? The answer is nobody�۪s: That organization like the panicked educators in the film itself holds fast to its rigid myopic policies to preserve its own authority. The members of the ratings board perform a useful function but this is not the first time they�۪ve politicianed us."

To remain immortal Hades has allied himself with the petulant Ares (Edgar Ramirez) to free Kronos the titan imprisoned in deepest Tartarus.

Because of injuries described by a doctor the police suspected Mr. Thomas of killing his son. He initially proclaimed his innocence but during a lengthy session with detectives he demonstrated how he roughly threw the infant into a crib. At the end of the videotaped 10-hour interrogation some of which is shown in the film Mr. Thomas signed a confession." the same doctor found no evidence of a fatal skull fracture; the death instead was attributed to sepsis a bacterial infection in the blood. Although Mr. Thomas recanted he was tried for murder and the videotape of his demonstration was shown to the jury which convicted him. Currently serving 25 years to life he just lost an appeal." jurors and medical experts are interviewed. And this smart cool-headed film which has a ���Rashomon�۝-like vision of the case presents a disturbing picture of courtroom justice and how different people come to opposite conclusions based on the same testimony."

deliberate and art house ready ���Para�_sos Artificiales�۝ (���Artificial Paradises�۝) the first feature by the Mexican director Yulene Olaizola teeters between the dreamy and the soporific. The dreamy part makes sense. The title comes from Baudelaire�۪s book about the effects of intoxicants (hashish opium wine) on the mind and drugs are the artificial paradises indulged in by Luisa and Salom�_n the main characters in Ms. Olaizola�۪s film. The soporific part is a problem." the coast of Veracruz Mexico a place of mist-enshrouded hills and rolling gray surf. Luisa (Luisa Pardo) has taken up residence in a down-at-the-heels resort where she seems to be the only guest. (Is it off season or is the business a bust?) She doesn�۪t have much to do besides brood smoke cigarettes gaze at the water and use heroin. She also manages to make a friend: Salom�_n (Salom�_n Hern��ndez) an older man who works in the fields (doing what isn�۪t quite clear) and smokes a lot of pot." with its long-held shots and meticulously composed frames. Ms. Olaizola though is more interested in atmosphere than in character or story. Her Veracruz has an overcast melancholic beauty that comes across far more vividly than Luisa or Salom�_n. Ms. Olaizola observes them as if hoping they�۪ll reveal themselves but they don�۪t. Luisa in particular remains a blank an addict with no back story and little front story. When a small drama sputters to life at the end it�۪s too late. You�۪ve already been lulled into dreamland."

the ferocious teenage warrior from ���The Hunger Games�۝? The answer from the evidence of Tarsem Singh�۪s ���Mirror Mirror �۝ a would-be comic and cheeky redo of Snow White is yes but not persuasively. The princess (Lily Collins) here smiles obligingly while flouncing about in a gown but she also helps write her own happily ever after with a sword. Whether that makes her a feminist heroine or just another self-actualized Disneyesque waif may depend on your idea of empowerment. (In June the fairy tale gets another makeover in ���Snow White and the Huntsman.�۝)" among others the Brothers Grimm and waggishly retrofitted for ���Mirror Mirror�۝ by Marc Klein and Jason Keller the essential story is as you probably remember it only with jokes: a widower King remarries giving the realm a new Queen (Julia Roberts seemingly very self-amused) and his only child Snow White a mother. But when the King disappears a turn that�۪s represented in the film by a striking animated sequence Snow White falls into the grasping hands of the Queen who turns out to be a pathological narcissist suffering from possible delusions. (She talks to her mirror.) You know the rest ��� seven dwarfs a prince a girl�۪s youth a woman�۪s vanity ��� all familiar pieces that are both this movie�۪s strength and its gravest flaws." but it�۪s a virtual breeze when compared with his previous movie ���Immortals �۝ a camp farrago set in ancient Greece (by way of a Vegas floor show) that runs an enervating 110 minutes. Critics like to take note of Mr. Singh�۪s eye-catching visuals and there�۪s no doubt he knows how to swank up performers and sets or rather hire talented professionals to do the job for him. The costumes in ���Mirror Mirror�۝ ��� by turns ethereal as a dream and as ponderous as sculptured marble ��� were created by Mr. Singh�۪s regular collaborator the Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka. (Ms. Ishioka who also designed the costumes for Francis Ford Coppola�۪s ���Dracula �۝ died in January.)" he has trouble putting them into vibrant kinetic meaningful play which effectively means that he�۪s a better window dresser than a movie director. ���Mirror Mirror�۝ is consistently watchable even when it drifts into dullness because Mr. Singh always gives you something to look at whether it�۪s the Queen�۪s blood-red gown the sailing clouds decorating her bedroom or the dwarfs�۪ woodland home. Everything looks as if it has been meticulously selected for this or that spot including the performers. Ms. Roberts Ms. Collins and Armie Hammer as Prince Alcott look as pretty as fairy-book illustrations but their performances are similarly one dimensional as if they had been art directed into place instead of cut loose." who plays the Queen�۪s henchman Brighton and whose amusingly tremulous cagey performance owes much to Bob Hope. Mr. Lane is the only performer who sounds comfortable delivering Mr. Klein and Mr. Keller�۪s often intentionally anachronistic dialogue which with its forced lightness and scattershot jokes makes an awkward fit with Mr. Singh�۪s lugubriousness. All of the scripted yuks register as an attempt to modernize the movie as does affording Snow the chance to play a role in her own rescue mostly by giving her a sword and putting her in palazzo pants. That�۪s nice even if in the end it comes down to the same old story of love glory and the devastating cost of female wrinkles."

The antithesis of a benign nature lover Kate is an angry and easily provoked woman.

It is often impossible to figure out what�۪s going on." such as it is Kate and her boyfriend Jeffrey (Olivier Martinez) a cameraman are filming a documentary about sharks when her colleague Themba (Sizwe Msufu) a safety diver who swims below her for her protection is menaced by a shark. When Themba tries to divert the shark it attacks and kills him and Kate is racked with guilt for the rest of the movie." her seal-watching business has gone bust and her boat is about to be taken by the bank.

There are no fixed rules." there is something for everyone. Each character is beautiful in a different way and all of them have shapely bodies. The blond slim Rachel is reminiscent of the younger Meg Ryan. Teri is dark-haired peppery and athletic. Franck who is French-Moroccan has a healer�۪s touch. Vincent the least talkative is brooding and tightly wound. He introduces Rachel to light face slapping and violent penetration during sex which she enjoys so much she asks Franck to give it a try." beautifully photographed in natural light are simultaneously matter-of-fact and blissful and warm-blooded viewers may feel more than a tinge of envy. That may be why the reaction to the movie at the 2010 Venice Film Festival was so snide and dismissive." �۝ whose screenplay was written by Mr. Cordier and Julie Peyr is the degree to which it glosses over its subject and characters. To add up to anything more than a sexy romp with comic touches it would have had to go much further than it dares. If the sex scenes tell you a little about the characters they don�۪t reveal nearly enough. When the increasingly curious wives begin to question their spouses and to compare notes with each other you want more explicit psychosexual details and stronger reactions." the children (Teri and Vincent have two) are practically invisible. Eventually Teri�۪s preadolescent daughter presents her mother with Rachel�۪s diary which she stole and Teri furtively reads it." family monogamy jealousy competitiveness and boredom. The deepest question it asks is whether it is possible to love two people at the same time."

The mildness of this past winter on the Eastern Seaboard might have seemed ominous yes but it was also pleasant and much of the time other social economic and political problems have a way of seeming more urgent than human survival." though the issue has a lethal terrifying urgency. ���The Island President �۝ a new documentary by Jon Shenk (���The Lost Boys of Sudan�۝) visits one such place the Maldives. That archipelago of roughly 1 200 low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean of which about 200 are inhabited is described as ���paradise crossed with paradise �۝ and its soft sand beaches and blue waters have made it a haven for wealthy tourists. Though the film includes spectacular aerial and underwater footage of the Maldives�۪ beauty it concentrates its attention on uglier realities." a dictator with the usual authoritarian habit of imprisoning torturing and terrorizing his opponents. Among them was Mohamed Nasheed who after years as a pro-democracy activist and a political prisoner was elected president at 41 in 2008." Mr. Nasheed faced an environmental crisis of existential dimensions. The steady rise in ocean levels caused by melting polar ice and increasing global temperatures had already caused serious erosion on some islands and the eventual catastrophic inundation of this small vulnerable nation was starting to look inevitable rather than just frighteningly plausible." and ���The Island President�۝ moves with the sometimes manic energy of a young ambitious leader throwing himself at enormous challenges. Informative revealing one-on-one interviews with Mr. Nasheed his advisers and his wife are interspersed with scenes from the hectic peripatetic life of a postmodern politician. Mr. Nasheed confers with members of his cabinet and British environmental advisers takes part in the filming of public service announcements (including one in which he pretends to hold a meeting underwater in scuba gear) takes cigarette breaks and travels to a series of conferences on climate change." the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Summit provides the film with its climax as Mr. Nasheed becomes a crucial player in a series of complex negotiations that he hopes will lead to a strong international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the film provides a reasonably clear account of the technical issues involved ��� there is much discussion about acceptable degrees of warming centimeters of ocean rise and parts per million of carbon dioxide in the air ��� it also sheds light on some of the 21st-century rituals of power and diplomacy.

I know what this one is about �۝ Terence Davies said at a recent screening of his new film ���The Deep Blue Sea �۝ adapted from a play by Terence Rattigan. He was explaining why when he was invited by the Rattigan Trust to film one of that playwright�۪s works he had chosen this 1952 tale of adultery and romantic despair. (It was previously brought to the screen in 1955 starring Vivien Leigh in a role performed in Mr. Davies�۪s version by Rachel Weisz.)" in the most literal sense about England in the years just after World War II a period of weary austerity and quiet hope that Mr. Davies born in Liverpool in 1945 has returned to again and again in the course of his filmmaking career. His autobiographical masterpieces ���Distant Voices Still Lives�۝ (1988) and ���The Long Day Closes�۝ (1993) evoke from a child�۪s point of view the pleasures and anxieties of a time when Britain still traumatized by the war seemed poised uneasily between the old and the new." which��concludes a retrospective of Mr. Davies�۪s films on Monday. ���The Long Day Closes�۝ will run for a week at Film Forum starting on Wednesday.)" though his reputation faded in subsequent decades eclipsed by angry young men kitchen-sink realists and a flamboyant avant-garde. Mr. Davies an unabashed nostalgist for pre-�۪60s unswinging England ��� he memorably trashes the Beatles in ���Of Time and the City �۝ his 2008 love letter to Liverpool ��� lovingly recalls the dust the chintz the popular songs and the women�۪s fashions of the old days. He also has an intuitive understanding of the strong feelings that lie beneath the dusty decorum and constrained behavior before the language of sexual liberation and personal fulfillment (to say nothing of feminism) had entered the lexicon of the Western democracies." for both Terences about a gay man�۪s sympathetic identification with such a woman ��� a vicar�۪s daughter a gentleman�۪s wife and a soldier�۪s lover who suffers like an operatic heroine. And so to put the matter perhaps more abstractly than such a sensual film deserves it is about the fate of untameable irrational desire in a world that does not seem to have a place for it." told in associative patterns rather than chronological order is a fairly ordinary even banal love triangle. Hester (Ms. Weisz) is married to a dull decent older man Sir William Collyer (Simon Russell Beale) who has in addition to a title an insufferable mother (Barbara Jefford). Eventually William discovers that Hester is having an affair with Freddie Page (Tom Hiddleston) a dashing former pilot who seems at least as we first encounter him the dreamy antithesis of his stolid rival." and it drifts ��� or rather leaps writhes and swoons propelled by Samuel Barber�۪s gloriously anguished Concerto for Violin and Orchestra ��� backward and forward from that ambiguous event assembling the fragments of her wounded yearning self. With William she was Lady Collyer. In the shabby rooming house where she tries to restart (and then to end) her life she is known as Mrs. Page even though her husband has refused to grant her a divorce." and whatever their class positions both men are morally and spiritually beneath her. It becomes clear over time that Freddie for all his vigor and bonhomie is shallow and fickle forever stuck in the war that was for all its horror his finest hour. Hester not only seems aware of his flaws but also acknowledges the asymmetry of their affections. He does love her but not with anywhere near the same the absolute unreasoning devotion." in the end most ardently and specifically about. The social and psychological particulars and the wonderful period details are part of the background. And Mr. Hiddleston and Mr. Beale disciplined and sensitive actors though they are exist in the penumbra of Ms. Weisz�۪s incandescence." to the extent that even the colors and textures of Florian Hoffmeister�۪s cinematography seem to flicker and intensify according to her shifting moods. And Ms. Weisz for her part gives Hester a full melodramatic coloration without overdoing conveying the essential split in the character�۪s nature. She is at once a sensible capable intelligent Englishwoman and a mad keening martyr for love." knowing romanticism in Hester that is both supported and undermined by Mr. Davies and Ms. Weisz�۪s understanding of her. In her attempted suicide in her rash headlong commitment to Freddie in her moments of stoicism as well as her bouts of hysteria she seems to be willing herself into a state of tragic grandeur that her circumstances do not entirely support. Which may be the saddest thing about her."

Seymour is remarkably tolerant of his son�۪s habit of squandering money he gives him for groceries that he forgets to buy. It is an unrewarding role for Mr. Fonda who spends much of his screen time glumly lounging around the apartment in his bathrobe. Seymour still seems to be grieving the loss of his wife who died when Morris was 14. But when the movie finally addresses the subject it is too little too late." a dapper fantasist whose tales of world adventures culminate with his announcement that he is moving to Montana with Hattie (Sarah Shahi) a new sweetheart whose father owns the building where Morris and Seymour live. Hattie�۪s father also runs an American division of an international criminal cartel in which N J says he has taken a high-paying job." armed with paint guns squatting in an unfinished building whose construction crew is supervised by Steven.

When she runs through that forest and even when she falls there�۪s something of the American frontiersman in her as if she were Natty Bumppo reborn and resexed." it seems possible that Gary Ross the unlikely and at times frustratingly ill-matched director for this brutal unnerving story has caught the heart-skipping pulse of Michael Mann�۪s ���Last of the Mohicans�۝ if not that film�۪s ravishing technique and propulsive energy. Alas Mr. Ross the director of the genial entertainments ���Pleasantville�۝ and ���Seabiscuit �۝ and whose script credits include ���Big �۝ has a way of smoothing even modestly irregular edges. Katniss who for years has bagged game to keep her family from starving was created for rough stuff ��� for beating the odds and the state for hunting squirrel and people both ��� far rougher than Mr. Ross often seems comfortable with perhaps because of disposition inclination or some behind-the-scenes executive mandate." possibly historic creation ��� stripped of sentimentality and psychosexual ornamentation armed with Diana�۪s bow and a ferocious will ��� Katniss is a new female warrior and she keeps you watching even while you�۪re hoping for something better the next time around. (Mr. Ross is onboard to direct the follow-up ���Catching Fire.�۝) For some fans of the three novels the screen version will inevitably be disappointing especially for those keeping inventory of the details characters grim thoughts and cynicism that have gone missing. For others the image of a girl like Katniss taking up so much screen space with so few smiles may be enough to keep faith." Ms. Collins and Billy Ray hews dutifully close to its source material at least in wide strokes. Katniss lives in District 12 of Panem ��� as in panem et circenses Latin for bread and circuses ��� a totalitarian state that has risen from the postwar ashes of North America. Every year a boy and a girl ages 12 to 18 are chosen from each Panem district to compete in the gladiatorial games of the title a fight that owes something to that ancient Roman blood sport and something else to the Greek myth of the Minotaur the part man part bull that devoured Athenian youths given in tribute. The Minotaur is eventually slain but that�۪s getting ahead of Katniss." or reaping a nationally televised event complete with armed soldiers and a bubbly bubblehead M.C. (Elizabeth Banks) during which Katniss�۪s younger sister Primrose (Willow Shields) is chosen. Katniss quickly volunteers to take Prim�۪s place becoming with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) District 12�۪s tributes. The two are whisked off to the Capitol where they�۪re plucked and primped by a team of gaudily hued stylists (overseen by a gilt-lidded Lenny Kravitz as Cinna) a potentially razor-sharp sequence that should underscore the Capitol�۪s decadence but here comes across as a variant on Dorothy�۪s cheery wash- and brush-up when she enters the Emerald City. Katniss may not be in Kansas but neither does she seem in palpable danger." with wits and weapons they battle the other tributes and assorted perils generated by the game makers (including a dandified Wes Bentley) who dole out death via computer touch screen. There in a rapidly cut massacre that pits boy against girl and finds youngsters killing and falling and dying in a frantic fragmented blur Mr. Ross and his editors Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling set the stage and stark mood. For her part Katniss though frozen in fear follows the advice of her and Peeta�۪s mentor Haymitch (an overly cute Woody Harrelson) and runs in the opposite direction. It�۪s a strong visceral scene that quickens the pace and pulse and distills the story�۪s horror ��� suffer the little children to enter the arena ��� in blunt visual terms." Clint Eastwood�۪s longtime cinematographer Mr. Ross tries to find mystery in the forest in its canopy of trees and thick undergrowth but never locates a deeper dread despite the computer-generated fireballs and hounds and especially the other tributes. Part of what makes the ���Hunger Games�۝ books so effective is that they literalize the familiar drama of adolescence translating the emotional assaults peer pressure cliques and the tortured rest into warfare. ���Buffy the Vampire Slayer�۝ did the same on television except there the villains were supernatural demons. In ���The Hunger Games�۝ the real enemies are adults including of course the parents catching the show on TV." and others may be reminded of Orson Scott Card�۪s science-fiction novel ���Ender�۪s Game �۝ about children trained to battle an alien species. If you�۪ve seen the pint-size assassins in the recent action flicks ���Kick-Ass�۝ and ���Hanna �۝ which feature prepubescent girls who lock load and shoot without batting a lash you may think you�۪ve also seen it before. You haven�۪t not really. Although the girls in those movies are vaguely sexualized their age exempts them from the narrative burdens of heterosexual romance. They don�۪t have to bat those lashes at the boys and they don�۪t need to be saved by them either as in the ���Twilight�۝ series." even if she�۪s at an age when most movies still insist women go weak at the knees and whimper and weep while waiting to be saved. Again and again Katniss rescues herself with resourcefulness guts and true aim a combination that makes her insistently watchable despite Mr. Ross�۪s soft touch and Ms. Lawrence�۪s bland performance. One look at District 12 which Mr. Ross conceives as a picturesque old-timey town ��� filled with withered Dorothea Lange types in what was once Appalachia ��� and it�۪s clear that someone here was enthralled with the actress�۪s breakout turn in ���Winter�۪s Bone�۝ as a willful resilient child of the Ozarks." but now at 21 her seductive womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission. The graver problem is a disengaged performance that rarely suggests the terrors Katniss faces including the fatalism that originally hangs on her like a shroud. What finally saves the character and film both is the image of her on the run moving relentlessly forward. Unlike those American Adams who have long embodied the national character with their reserves of hope innocence and optimism Katniss springs from someplace else a place in which an American Eve battered bruised and deeply knowing scrambles through a garden not of her making on her way to a new world."

���Losing Control�۝ centers on a young scientist who gets the engagement jitters and decides to test whether there are other fish in the sea. Armed with a performance chart and the oblivious belief that her China-bound boyfriend will stand by and wait Samantha (Miranda Kent) seeks out and judges men when she�۪s not plugging away at a stalled doctoral project involving sperm samples in a Harvard Medical School laboratory." Valerie Weiss believes it does. This movie her debut feature marches indefatigably through crude bits of business wearily rehearsed caricatures (paranoid Jewish mother straight-shooting best friend incomprehensible Chinese colleague kooky artist suitor) and oh-brother a-ha moments at designated pivot points in the story. When in doubt Ms. Weiss resorts to a lab emergency or a frantic misunderstanding." Sam and her boyfriend an Eastern Studies scholar named Ben (Reid Scott likably doing smart and sensitive) do make a cute earnest academic couple. And Sam�۪s panicked stasis both social and professional corresponds to a recognizable epidemic of the howling fantods in our nation�۪s graduate schools. But the tireless Ms. Kent perpetually on screen has to work at maintaining na��ve bright-eyed perk and a credible sense of moment-to-moment motivation." as when the film deals with the behavior of jerks and a flustered cabby but these are not likely to be replicated in the lab.

Mr. Ferrara makes this point with ingenuity and characteristic thrift by using found news footage to provide images of apocalypse. Crowds gather in St. Peter�۪s Square; candlelight processions wind through the streets of unidentified cities." �۝ Mr. Ferrara�۪s 20th feature is not another colossal special-effects-laden end-times Hollywood spectacle." like Lars von Trier�۪s ���Melancholia �۝ it offers an intimately scaled view of the destruction of the world with an emphasis on how it all feels to a Bohemian couple living on Mr. Ferrara�۪s beloved Lower East Side of Manhattan." Cisco (Willem Dafoe) as she watches him shave. ���I do it for you�۝ is his sweet reply but her question is absurd in its own way. Why is she working so hard to complete one last painting? Why does she keep changing her clothes? But then again what else should she be doing?" she and Cisco seem to manage pretty well. They make love order Chinese takeout and occasionally let their dread and anguish get the better of them." who is much older than Skye and has a nearly grown daughter has one last conversation with her (via Skype) and one last screaming futile argument with his former wife. Skye says goodbye to her mother (Anita Pallenberg). Cisco a drug addict who has been clean for more than two years thinks about getting high and wanders over to a friend�۪s apartment to test his resolve." and the film which runs a scant 85 minutes feels longer than that. This may be because Mr. Ferrara wants to explore the ways time can stretch out or stand still in anticipation of a terrible event and also to show that such an event even if it is happening everywhere and to everybody is nonetheless highly subjective." and though there is an occasional flicker of doubt that it will actually happen all of the public and private voices of reason and faith seem to agree that there is no way out." Cisco turns to the videotaped wisdom of Al Gore the Dalai Lama and other sages. Skye immerses herself in her art and wraps herself in a series of lovely vintage-looking frocks. Mr. Ferrara observes them serenely and allows the audience to feel curiously flattered to share the human race�۪s terminal hours with such cool sexy good-looking specimens." �۝ in which Mr. Dafoe played the owner of a fading strip club. These movies present a somewhat chastened older-and-wiser side of a wild often chaotic talent but the stubborn lower-depths romanticism that colors Cisco and Skye�۪s world has always been essential to Mr. Ferrara�۪s work. Esteemed by many critics revered in Europe and still perhaps best known in this country for his crime films ���King of New York�۝ (1990) and ���Bad Lieutenant�۝ (1992) Mr. Ferrara remains something of a marginal figure in American cinema." his louche outlaw sensibility seems to be more in tune with a particular strain of American literature than with the native film tradition which has tolerated its share of mavericks but has rarely made room for authentic gutter poets. Though he has the visual instincts of a born filmmaker Mr. Ferrara may be more at home alongside writers like Henry Miller Hubert Selby Jr. Charles Bukowski and the other hard-bitten openhearted bards of macho excess pulp eroticism and existential defeat." Mr. Ferrara�۪s movies ��� even a comparatively sober and quiet one like ���4:44�۝ ��� are acts of defiance and affronts to conventional wisdom while at the same time thoroughly and disarmingly sincere even to the point of sentimentality. It is certainly possible to sneer at both the histrionics and the downtown deadpan that Ms. Leigh and Mr. Dafoe display and to raise an eyebrow at the hazy spiritual aura that Mr. Ferrara�۪s camera casts over them." terrible and sublimely ordinary series of moments."

They are first seen rehearsing an Easter pageant directed by Austin (Mr. Cone) the pastor�۪s fresh-faced young assistant in which the boy playing Jesus falls off the cross (no deeper meaning implied)." she goes through the motions while exhibiting an uneasy sense of self-betrayal.

Of his attempt to reconcile his sexuality with his faith she insists: ���You can�۪t be both.

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/movies/the-kid-with-a-bike-from-jean-pierre-and-luc-dardenne.html
�۝ a quietly rapturous film about love and redemption from Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne races along with frightening intensity his little legs pedaling hard his eyes fixed on a heart-heavy destination. What the 11-year-old Cyril (the newcomer Thomas Doret touchingly serious) wants ��� what every muscle in his small tensed body strains toward ��� is the father who left him at a children�۪s home abandoning his only son to the kindness of strangers with as seemingly little regard and feeling as someone else might toss a pair of old shoes." Guy (J̩r̩mie Renier a Dardenne regular) initially drives ���The Kid With a Bike �۝ giving it relentless momentum (those small legs pump like pistons) and investing it with palpable peril. Early in the film Cyril escapes the home and races out trying to find his father. He makes his way to the bleak apartment complex where they lived but all that remains of their life together are empty rooms and peeling walls. For a long painful moment Cyril stands eerily still in one of the rooms facing away from the camera ��� his shoulders look so small ��� the camera keeping a slight distance from this child who has literally turned his back on the world." you may feel as if you recognize this willful child. Like the title teenage character in their film ���Rosetta �۝ Cyril is an extraordinarily physical presence ��� you�۪re acutely aware of the effort involved in his movements in his running colliding and scaling walls ��� and stubborn. For Cyril this seeming obstinacy is a manifestation of faith: he feverishly believes in his father believes that they will be reunited and that Guy would never have sold Cyril�۪s beloved bicycle." Cyril is off again a few steps ahead of the children�۪s home counselors who have followed. He tries to take refuge in a medical office in the building where he crashes into a woman Samantha (C̩cile de France) so hard that they both fall as the counselors move in. Cyril locks her in a hug holding on as if to a buoy as the counselors try to pry him loose. ���You can hold me �۝ Samantha says ���but not so tight.�۝ The collision happens so fast that you may not initially recognize the underlying poeticism of the milieu a place of suffering and healing. In an interview in Film Comment Jean-Pierre Dardenne characterizes Cyril�۪s hold on Samantha as a ���reverse Piet��.�۝" Mary cradles Jesus in her arms after the crucifixion ��� is of a piece with the Dardennes�۪ profound socially conscious explorations of familiar Christian (they were raised as Roman Catholics) themes of love forgiveness redemption and moral awakening in a secular context and age. Or as Luc Dardenne once put it about another of their films ���when God is dead.�۝ In the earlier film ���The Son �۝ for instance a carpenter newly acquainted with the teenager who years before killed his child makes a decision not to murder the teenager. In ���The Child�۝ a young hustler sells his own newborn son for money only to save the infant another child and finally himself." she begins to bring him close first by retrieving his bicycle. Much of the story written by the Dardennes and set as usual around the post-industrial municipality of Seraing Belgium involves a series of quotidian incidents after Cyril at his request starts staying with Samantha on weekends. (You wonder if he thinks he�۪s found a sucker.) Cyril bikes and bikes some more; Samantha works at her hair salon. As he continues his searching his restlessness matched by the Dardennes�۪ moving camera (the cinematographer is their regular invaluable collaborator Alain Marcoen) the relationship between Cyril and Samantha brings to mind one of the laws of motion: A body in motion travels in a straight path until acted on by an outside force." as elsewhere in the Dardennes�۪ work that outside force is another human being. The Dardennes never explain why Samantha agrees to take care of Cyril. She doesn�۪t attend church or spout pieties; there�۪s nothing obviously in it for her. Rather her goodness is a given. It�۪s hard not to think that Ms. de France who here wears a lot of sleeveless blouses was partly cast for her beautifully sculptured arms which look strong enough to lift any burden. The solidity of those arms and of Ms. de France�۪s overall physicality function somewhat contrapuntally with the uncharacteristic brief flourishes from Beethoven�۪s Piano Concerto No. 5 (the ���Emperor�۝ Concerto) that punctuate several scenes a use of music that recalls the films of Robert Bresson an important influence on the Dardennes." the music soaring as well as what appears to be a kind of resurrection makes it easy to read ���The Kid With a Bike�۝ as a religious allegory though that would be reductive. One thing that makes the Dardennes�۪ work so vibrant at once new and seemingly timeless is that they ask the most urgent questions we can ask of ourselves ��� including what is it to be human ��� and in nondoctrinaire nonproscriptive terms. This isn�۪t to deny the religious influence which runs as deep in their films as it does in the outside world but to argue that they have recast that influence in philosophical and aesthetic terms. ���Rosetta �۝ ���The Son �۝ ���The Child�۝ and ���The Kid With a Bike�۝ are in the most expansive sense good works."

A quick-sketch routine stretched ��� amusingly absurdly thinly ��� to feature length ���Casa de Mi Padre�۝ (���House of My Father�۝) stars Mr. Ferrell as Armando Alvarez the eldest son of a rancher down Mexico or rather down telenovela way where the men are brave the women beautiful the villains venal the passions inflamed the prose empurpled the sunsets honeyed and the dangers as numerous as the clich̩s." the self-aware script by Andrew Steele a ���Saturday Night Live�۝ alumnus creaks and groans rising arthritically or just lazily to the inciting incident when Armando�۪s twitchy youngest brother Raul (Diego Luna) returns to the ranch with his fianc̩e the tousle-haired Sonia (Genesis Rodriguez). There�۪s a suggestion of family pathology ��� Pap�� Alvarez (Pedro Armend��riz Jr.) overtly favors Raul calling Armando all kinds of est̼pido ��� but mostly there are platitudes sidelong glances trembling lips awkward laughs bursts of music throwaway sight gags (a flock of miniskirted maids) and well-chosen costumes and accouterments.

Yet while Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Tarantino are true believers Mr. Steele and the director of ���Casa de Mi Padre �۝ Matt Piedmont (another ���Saturday Night Live�۝ vet) come across as dabblers. That may be why they have a tough time finding a persuasive tone. The biggest joke in ���Casa de Mi Padre�۝ is that Mr. Ferrell speaks Spanish without winking throughout the hyperserious proceedings and as he often does he turns his character�۪s innocence into a strange state of grace. The sincerity of his performance makes Armando seem foolish and therefore funnier at least when he has enough good material." by contrast mostly seem to be having a goof playing cowboys and narcos and their barely contained smiles however shining work against Mr. Ferrell�۪s commitment and undermine the movie�۪s poker-faced interests. ���Casa de Mi Padre�۝ is best when it stops pretending that anyone including the filmmakers cares about the pointless story which also includes too much unfunny business with a few American lawmen that wastes the mustachioed brilliance of Nick Offerman. Far better are its oases of absurdity like an increasingly preposterous sex scene featuring the inevitably naked Mr. Ferrell once again flaunting his furred assets and a lysergic trip to the other side with a conspicuously ersatz white leopard whose coat is almost as matted." hard drugs soft women."

The aura of holy foolishness that hangs around him is not just bong exhaust: he turns out to be the hero of a disarmingly sincere spiritual fable." passive-aggressive joke. Or maybe ��� most likely ��� both. ���Jeff Who Lives at Home �۝ like the Duplass brothers�۪ earlier ���Cyrus �۝ is a fascinating stylistic experiment an attempt to bring the scruffy discursive lo-fi aesthetic of Mumblecore into some kind of harmony with the genre imperatives of commercial moviemaking. ���Cyrus �۝ with Jonah Hill as the overgrown stay-at-home kid forged an unstable alloy of hilarity and creepiness." Who Lives at Home�۝ is more consistent in its tone and coherent in its story.

It pays homage less to the work of Judd Apatow or any other boy-comedy auteur than to the slick supernatural hokum of M. Night Shyamalan." but I kind of suspect it isn�۪t. Jeff is obsessed with the movie ���Signs �۝ Mr. Shyamalan�۪s 2002 tale of tinfoil hats and alien visitation. Jeff is convinced that ordinary occurrences in his own life have special significance. Is this pothead paranoia simple stupidity or something more?" Pat (Ed Helms) would be inclined to choose the second of those options. His contempt for Jeff is magnified by his own delusional self-regard: he likes to think of himself as a winner a go-getter a guy who has it all figured out. In other words he is a sarcastic insensitive jerk who sports a desperate goatee and spends money he doesn�۪t have on a sports car infuriating his wife Linda (Judy Greer). ���I�۪m trying to be a grown-up �۝ she sighs which is usually what the women say in movies like this one." in a single pivotal scene she helps to jolt the film out of its coy zaniness into a zone of real pain and frustration.

Who Lives at Home�۝ takes place within a single eventful day during which Pat tests out his new Porsche and discovers that Linda might be cheating on him. Jeff meanwhile faces the (for him) equally daunting challenge of running a simple errand for his mother Sharon (Susan Sarandon). For her part Sharon finds her dull routine upended by instant messages from a secret admirer who may be a co-worker." and the Duplasses aided by the sometimes forced jauntiness of Michael Andrews�۪s musical score make it seem at once wildly farcical and fairly ordinary. A pall of middle-class anxiety hangs over the characters�۪ lives as they try to turn mediocre cards into winning hands. Sharon works in a drab little cubicle doing something not worth talking about for a company whose business is never identified. We know from Pat�۪s uniform that he sells paint but the filmmakers don�۪t follow him to work and nobody believes his self-aggrandizing talk of ���business meetings.�۝ Jeff�۪s rhetoric of destiny vague and pathetic though it may be is also an implicit critique of the way the pursuit of happiness can resemble a cruel con." Utopian protest against the way the world really is. The ending is also a test of the audience�۪s openness to the kind of fantasy mocked at the outset by everyone in Jeff�۪s life including the filmmakers.

Then comes the more physical part: He takes a squeegee loaded with a single pigment and drags it across the surface. Each swipe covers the old painting and reveals a new composition. Watching this can be fascinating even exciting. After all it prompts a fundamental movie question: What happens next?" whose method is to show rather than to tell (no talking heads here) filmed Mr. Richter now 80 mostly in 2009. Though he talks a bit about his life and history this documentary isn�۪t a primer about his career. Ms. Belz is interested in process and work which for Mr. Richter means looking and judging as much as it does applying paint to canvas." �۝ he says regarding two pieces in progress.

A painting is finished when there�۪s nothing else he can do." work also means the more mundane business of nurturing a career. Ms. Belz�۪s film meanders a bit as we see Mr. Richter planning exhibitions with his assistants (they put tiny photos of the works into dollhouselike models of galleries); attending openings and museum shows (where some of his figurative work is seen); facing a storm of clicking cameras and flashbulbs. It�۪s a relief as it must be for Mr. Richter when the movie returns to the calm of the studio and to painting." Mr. Richter remains an excellent subject serious and purposeful but also unexpectedly good-natured. Not that he�۪s entirely comfortable with the presence of the camera while he�۪s working." �۝ he says adding that being watched like this is worse than being in the hospital."

�۝ a wonderful new film from the American-born Israeli director Joseph Cedar at once affirms this conventional wisdom and calls it into question. The movie�۪s very title suggests that its concerns are marginal esoteric even trivial. A summary of the story ��� an abstract as it might be called in a learned journal ��� would barely rise to the level of anecdote. A prestigious award intended for one scholar is mistakenly bestowed on another. Trouble ensues." but surely the rest of us have more important things to worry about than the wounded vanity of intellectuals. The genius of ���Footnote�۝ is that it is about those important things too. Deftly turning the law of inverse proportions on its head Mr. Cedar spins a committee-room squabble into something authentically grand: a piercing satire a poignant family drama and an investigation of the competing claims of honesty loyalty ambition and love. Really the stakes could hardly be higher." whose previous work includes the brutal anxious war movie ���Beaufort�۝ (like ���Footnote �۝ an Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film) handles heavy themes with a light touch. He uses jaunty music (the score is by Amit Poznansky) printed chapter titles and witty forays into memory and fantasy to emphasize the absurdity of this odd little tale allowing the precision of his writing and the discipline of the actors to reveal its essential gravity." both experts in the highly specialized deeply competitive field of Talmudic studies happen to be father and son. Eliezer Shkolnik the father is a philologist of the old school devoting himself to the close textual analysis of manuscripts and hewing to a rigorously scientific idea of their meaning. In his carrel at the Hebrew University library in Jerusalem and in his study at home (where he wears headphones to block out the distractions of the world) he brushes the finest grain of sacred writings hoping to sift out tiny and therefore solid truths. Everything else is not just commentary but worse: superstition gossip theory aesthetics ��� the very antithesis of real scholarship." airy speculation happens to be the specialty of his son Uriel (Lior Ashkenazi) an academic star with a shelf full of books and articles on his curriculum vitae and a busy schedule of public lectures. As Eliezer toils in obscurity Uriel an eminent professor at the same university basks in acclaim ��� an awkward situation made more so by Eliezer�۪s longstanding sense of having been neglected and undermined. Early in his career a significant discovery that might have made his name was upstaged by his nemesis a certain Professor Grossman (Micah Lewensohn) who Eliezer believes has blocked his progress ever since. The only achievement he can hold onto is a footnote in one of his long-dead mentor�۪s books in which Eliezer is credited by name with a small insight that everyone else has since forgotten." as a good Jewish father is expected to take pride in it. And when the winners of Israel�۪s most coveted prize in the arts and sciences are announced the fraught relations between father and son erupt into an intergenerational tzimmes worthy of Shakespeare Freud or the more melodramatic portions of the Hebrew Bible. It plays as farce but the chords of family tragedy resonate underneath the laughter." it also takes subtle account of the part played by Uriel�۪s mother Yehudit (Alisa Rosen) and his wife Dikla (Alma Zak). ���Footnote�۝ is at least as interested in what it means to live with an important (or self-important) scholar as in what it means to be one and if you watch closely you can discern another of Mr. Cedar�۪s clever reversals of emphasis." Judaism may be profoundly patriarchal ��� for thousands of years the study of its crucial texts was restricted to men ��� but it is also matrilineal meaning that Jewish identity whatever that might be is passed down through the maternal line. This chronicle of fathers and sons is equally perhaps primarily a story about mothers." and not incidentally one of the most accurate depictions I have ever seen of the peculiar mores and rituals of academe. Among the many memorable scenes ��� which include moments of high farce agonized confrontation and linguistic sleuthing ��� the one I found most remarkable is a tense conclave around a table in a departmental office. The participants are squeezed around a too-small table hemmed in by books and papers that threaten to bury them. Tempers fray and flare until the situation resembles a literal enactment of a line from William Butler Yeats: ���Great hatred little room.�۝" but it would be hard to come up with a better four-word description of Israel and its surroundings. And while the overwhelming exhausting political questions that dominate most films from Israel (including ���Beaufort�۝) are not addressed in ���Footnote �۝ they are not exactly avoided either. Whatever schisms and contradictions afflict the Jewish state ��� feel free to make your own list ��� are somehow implicit in the primal divide within the Shkolnik family." which may or may not be cause for optimism. Academic life and family life are both built on love ��� the love of learning the love of other people ��� but they survive on contention renewing and extending quarrels from one generation to the next. Interpretation begets interpretation and a father�۪s mistakes are corrected by the errors of his children. There is no reason to suppose or to hope that this will end. The substance of human existence is argument and each of us has a footnote to contribute."

���Dissolution �۝ the remarkable new work from the Israeli-American filmmaker Nina Menkes explores a soul stained by blood and smothered by loneliness." the story (written by Ms. Menkes with contributions from Mr. Fire) loosely transplants Dostoyevsky�۪s ���Crime and Punishment�۝ to a present-day region paralyzed by violence. Unnamed unmoored and profoundly depressed (though we don�۪t learn why until late in the film) the man spends his days wandering the streets and his evenings in desultory flirtations in a gloomy bar." and contributor to the anger around him ��� an innocent neighbor is stabbed by her jealous fianc̩ and arguments bleed through closed doors ��� he appears increasingly hemmed in the film�۪s hallways and stairwells offering only one way out." Ms. Menkes�۪s often exquisite compositions ��� a single attenuated shot of the aftermath of a car crash is a miracle of choreography ��� drive a narrative mired in poverty and spiritual desperation. Though devoid of music scenes pulse with the rhythms of brutality as our antihero sharpens a knife to the beat of a metronome and gurgled screams echo off screen. Here dreams and reality rub shoulders and redemption seems as distant as peace itself."

Marie Losier�۪s playful profile of the English musician and artist Genesis Breyer P-Orridge and his second wife Lady Jaye (who died in 2007) takes a lighthearted look at the things they did for love." some might say for attention. As ���The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye�۝ makes abundantly clear this couple thrived on two things: loving each other and making spectacles of themselves. When in 2000 they began a series of plastic surgeries ��� including matching breast implants ��� in a bizarre attempt to merge identities these twin passions dovetailed into a continuing performance piece that they called ���pandrogeny �۝ but that others might call working out your issues. Either way Ms. Losier�۪s entranced gaze leaves no room for questioning artistic merit ��� though the opinion of the record producer Rick Rubin whose money probably inadvertently helped finance this gender-bending enterprise would have been well worth soliciting." Ms. Losier allows her kinky subject to control the message adopting a whimsical superfan approach that steers well clear of his darker interests. Frayed-looking performance film alternates with cuddly home movies and the director�۪s theatrical interventions but the couple�۪s willingness to bare flesh only heightens the overall feeling of artifice. Straddling the line between avant-garde and Looney Tunes their extraordinary union seems strangely childlike its happy innocence in harsh contrast to their aggressively explicit public provocations. As we listen to Mr. P-Orridge recall his horrific experiences as a schoolboy in Britain it�۪s clear that lost little boy is still here bathing the film in a melancholy that even its most effervescent contrivances cannot dispel.

The movie eagerly sells itself as semitrashy almost-campy fun but it is so lavish and fussy that you can�۪t help thinking that it wants to be taken seriously and therefore you laugh at rather than with its mock sublimity." and a problem of scale. ���John Carter�۝ tries to evoke to reanimate a fondly recalled universe of B-movies pulp novels and boys�۪ adventure magazines.

It is hard for a movie lover not to detect a wink in this otherwise perfectly ordinary scene since Jonathan is played by Robert De Niro the most famous taxi driver in movies. ���Being Flynn�۝ is a much milder movie than ���Taxi Driver �۝ pursuing intimate themes rather than big ideas but Jonathan Flynn and Travis Bickle are linked by the discrepancy between self-image and reality and also by Mr. De Niro�۪s gift for portraying alienated men at odds with themselves." the last of which was directed by Mr. Weitz. And while his performance as Jonathan Flynn strays now and then into histrionics (not without reason) it also provides a reminder of what a resourceful unpredictable and subtle actor Mr. De Niro can be." orange juice bile and delusions of grandeur. He is a writer and in his own estimation one of only three in American letters worth bothering with the other two being Mark Twain and J. D. Salinger. His own shaggy rambling manner and his shabby circumstances suggest Charles Bukowski but with more blarney and less compassion. ���We are put on this earth to help other people�۝ is his motto but in practice it seems to mean that everyone else on earth should either see to his needs or leave him alone." or the only writer in ���Being Flynn.�۝ The movie is equally the story of his son Nick who grew up with his mother (Julianne Moore) and the legend of his absent dad.

In his 20s Nick played by Paul Dano starts working at a homeless shelter where Jonathan after losing his apartment and his job happens to take up residence. The two of them establish a difficult painful and ambiguous connection. The real Nick Flynn wrote about this in a memoir with a title too pungent and profane for me to repeat here. Mr. Weitz whose adaptation has been approved by Mr. Flynn has softened and streamlined the story but his desire to retain some of the book�۪s candor and poetry is evident. Sometimes awkwardly and sometimes gracefully ���Being Flynn�۝ charts a middle course between the rough honesty of its source and the sentimental triteness of the much worse movie it could have been." of redemption and recovery and hard lessons tenderly learned is a staple of movies and television and the magnetic pull of that therapeutic genre is hard to resist. It is to Mr. Weitz�۪s credit that he tries. He does not force Jonathan and Nick into teary embraces or ringing speeches but rather lets Mr. Dano and Mr. De Niro find their own rhythms which don�۪t always harmonize. Mr. Dano is a quiet inscrutable presence but has an odd charisma a blend of sensitivity and bottled-up rage that makes him an intriguing foil for Mr. De Niro as he was for Daniel Day-Lewis in ���There Will be Blood.�۝" and it is easier to sympathize with someone tormented by the death of his mother and the toxic legacy of his father�۪s neglect. He has his own self-destructive patterns of behavior but these are examined more superficially than his father�۪s which is too bad." notably Denise (Olivia Thirlby) a co-worker at the shelter and his sometime lover a relatively sane and stable witness to his agony as he goes through a struggle with addiction followed by a somewhat too quick and schematic recovery. Jonathan meanwhile spirals ever downward and you can almost hear the movie arguing with itself about how far to follow him how raw to allow itself to be." which I don�۪t mean to sound as harsh as it does. There is honest feeling genuine humanity and real intelligence in this movie but there is also a sense of caution of indecisiveness that undermines its potential power. ���Being Flynn�۝ is an honorably ambivalent film finally unsure of what to do with the two strong complicated characters at its center."

the Chinese action comedy ���Let the Bullets Fly�۝ could have trouble translating its home box-office success to Western shores. At least 30 minutes and several scams too long the plot passes from amusing to confounding long before the final double-cross." this noodle western follows the exploits of the bandit Pocky Zhang (played with gentlemanly restraint by the director Jiang Wen). When Zhang hijacks a train containing Ma (Ge You) the corrupt new governor of Goose Town the quick-thinking Ma poses as a counselor and suggests that they combine forces and with Zhang in the role of governor bleed the townsfolk of as much cash as possible." Ma. Lying in wait in Goose Town is Huang (Chow Yun-Fat) a local crime lord whose bottomless greed has already drained the region dry. As Zhang becomes a twisted Robin Hood and Huang tries to kill as much of the cast as possible the rascally story owes as much to Charlie Chaplin as to Sergio Leone." disguising and swapping identities so frequently that following the racing subtitles demands constant attention.

�۝ by Dr. Seuss has occasionally been caught up in squalls of controversy most of it cooked up by people choosing to be outraged by the book�۪s mild allegorical moral of ecological responsibility. In our own globally warmed ideologically fevered moment there has been a minor flurry of predictable pre-emptive bloviation aimed at Universal�۪s movie version ���Dr. Seuss�۪ The Lorax �۝ which is supposedly part of a left-wing Hollywood conspiracy to brainwash America�۪s children into hating capitalism and loving trees." I�۪m not sure whether to mock the enemies of ���The Lorax�۝ for their cluelessness to offer them reassurance or to compliment them for being half-right. Thematically the movie directed by Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda from a script by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul and made under the auspices of the Illumination animation studio dutifully lectures its audience on the folly of overconsumption and the virtue of conservation. At times the imagery takes on a dark almost apocalyptic cast as it surveys the smogged-up denuded landscape where the trees used to be and the shiny commercialized pseudo-utopia (called Thneedville) that an alienated humanity having lost the memory of nature now calls home." useless piece of junk reverse-engineered into something resembling popular art in accordance with the reigning imperatives of marketing and brand extension." nor of reflexive Loraxian dogmatism on my part. The corporate entertainment system has shown itself perfectly capable of injecting soul into what it sells and at inflecting some of its products with a critical spirit. ���Wall-E�۝ is a transcendent example brilliantly embracing its own contradictions but there are plenty of other movies animated and not that manage to pay tribute to the beauty of the natural world even as they revel in giddy merchandising-friendly artifice." it should be noted was hardly averse to commerce. He started out in advertising and built his middle name into a formidable brand that like the Once-ler�۪s empire in ���The Lorax �۝ grew bigger and bigger and bigger. But in his lifetime Geisel exercised strict quality control a practice that his estate has abandoned authorizing a series of cinematic abominations both live-action (���Dr. Seuss�۪ How the Grinch Stole Christmas �۝ ���Dr. Seuss�۪ The Cat in the Hat�۝) and animated (���Dr. Seuss�۪s Horton Hears a Who!�۝ and now this one)." �۝ while it nods in the direction of Dr. Seuss�۪s distinctive trippy drawing style treats his sensibility as at best a decorative element. The movie�۪s silliness like its preachiness is loud and slightly hysterical as if young viewers could be entertained only by a ceaseless barrage of sensory stimulus and pop-culture attitude or instructed by songs that make the collected works of Up With People sound like Metallica. The simple fable of the Lorax and the Once-ler is wrapped in gaudy familiar business and festooned with grim forced cheer. What do the kids want? Car chases! Kooky grandmas! Pint-size villains flanked by thuggish minions! Things that fly! Taylor Swift!" one about a young boy named Ted (Zac Efron) who in order to impress a girl (Ms. Swift) sets out to find an actual living tree. (Of course the girl couldn�۪t possibly go out and find the tree herself a sexist assumption that is unfortunately the only authentically Seussian aspect of the movie.) He ventures over the metal wall that encloses Thneedville and finds the Once-ler (Ed Helms) a hermit who tells the tale of his own encounter with the cranky orange Lorax (Danny DeVito)." and no movie can change that. And when the Lorax is around warily befriending the ambitious Once-ler you can almost believe you are in the Seussian universe. The parable of an ambitious entrepreneur who lets his ingenuity curdle into unchecked greed is more or less intact and his corruption is conveyed in a few memorable semi-inspired visual flights. But these only emphasize the hectic willful mediocrity that characterizes the rest of the movie and far too many of its kind." the Once-ler ravages the landscape and destroys the Truffula trees to manufacture thneeds knitted garments that have multiple uses but no real utility. Demand for them is insatiable for a while and then once the trees are gone the thneeds are forgotten partly because nobody really needed them in the first place. There is an obvious metaphor here but the movie is blind to it and to everything else that is interesting or true in the story it tries to tell." a bit of naughtiness nonstop hucksterism."

During the subsequent decades of Ceausescu�۪s dictatorship which ended in 1989 Mr. Pintilie like many independent-minded Eastern European artists tried to work within the system and then went into exile leaving for the West in 1973 and returning after Ceausescu was gone." ���Reenactment�۝ (1970) stands among the exemplary works of its region and time. Subtle difficult and brave it represents a powerful statement of artistic honesty in a culture of official lies and evasions." among them ���Niki and Flo �۝ a mordant almost-comedy from 2003 that represents a bridge ��� and also a battle ��� between the old Romania and the new. It will run for a week at MoMA receiving a belated and welcome North American premiere." who came of age in the Ceausescu era and its aftermath and who would go on to collaborate on ���The Death of Mr. Lazarescu�۝ (directed by Mr. Puiu) the breakthrough film of the Romanian new wave. Mr. Pintilie is one of the few older Romanian directors active in the Communist period claimed as an influence by the skeptical realists of the younger generation who mostly disdain the oblique allegorical aesthetics and the compromised politics of their elders. ���Niki and Flo�۝ is a fascinating stylistic hybrid its observant naturalism infused with a delicate almost coy sense of the absurd." a retired colonel in the Romanian Army has a stoical demeanor but a way of carrying himself that suggests a reservoir of gentleness and sensitivity. He is also grieving stricken when we first meet him in the spring of 2001 by the sudden death of his only son Mihai (Marius Galea) and the impending departure of his daughter Angela (Dorina Chiriac) for America with her husband Eugen (Serban Pavlu)." known as Flo whose aggressive ridiculous embrace of modernity stands in comic painful contrast to Niki�۪s impassive traditionalism. A know-it-all and a micromanager a dabbler in fads who mistakes boorishness for flair Flo wears a baseball cap emblazoned with the word Genius (in English) and presents Niki with a video of Eugen and Angela�۪s wedding labeled (in French) ���un film de Florian Tufaru.�۝" accidentally revealing pseudo-cinematic flourishes amplify the moods and themes suggested by Mr. Pintilie�۪s patient classical way of filming and cutting. The wedding is a perfectly ordinary episode that is therefore a volatile blend of farcical and tragic elements a wild party in which the latent tensions within the families and the subterranean contradictions of their society rise to the surface without being quite acknowledged." including Eugen and Angela; their mothers Poucha (the marvelous Coca Bloos) and Doina (Mihaela Caracas); and Mihai�۪s widow Irina (Andreea Bibiri). Its center of gravity however is unquestionably Niki whose suffering is all but invisible to everyone around him. His evident struggle to uphold an ideal of capable selfless patriotic manhood ��� an ideal no one else seems to care about or even recognize ��� is the axis of the film�۪s drama and it turns into something larger more complicated and more frightening than the quiet sorrow of an old man." �۝ ���Niki and Flo�۝ pivots in ways I am reluctant to reveal from calm unstated tension to almost surreal violence. The shocks that arrive in the film�۪s final act may seem arbitrary but they are also reminders that normalcy ��� whether in the vanished shadowy world of Communism or in the bright familiar domain of consumer capitalism ��� is always founded on hypocrisy and menaced by chaos."

but at least at first glance this new 75-minute work of cinema by Jafar Panahi has little in common with any sly Surrealist prank." as Mr. Panahi one of the leading Iranian filmmakers of the past decade was under a legal assault from his government that included the confiscation of his passport the threat of a long prison sentence and an even longer ban on making movies." Mojtaba Mirtahmasb (credited as co-director) comes to his apartment to shoot and Mr. Panahi restricts his activities to talking recording with his iPhone commenting on some of his earlier films and reading aloud from existing scripts. So if this is not a film it is among other things a statement of creative resistance in the face of tyranny and a document of intellectual freedom under political duress." in a way back to Magritte because while ���This Is Not a Film�۝ bristles with a topical real-world urgency pointedly excluded from the Surrealist project it is also a provocative radical and at times surprisingly playful meditation on the nature of representation. Using modest ready-to-hand techniques and a format that seems to emphasize the most banal literal-minded artless aspects of picture taking Mr. Panahi has constructed a subtle strange and haunting work of art." though by now they should be familiar with movies that explore the enigmatic qualities of everyday life while at the same time inviting ruminations on the ambiguities of cinema itself. In the 1990s and the early years of this century Iranian filmmakers like Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Abbas Kiarostami Mr. Panahi�۪s erstwhile mentor blended social inquiry with formal self-consciousness in a series of experiments that amounted to the invention of a new style." social realism and poetic insight." �۝ Mr. Makhmalbaf�۪s ���Moment of Innocence�۝ and ���The Apple�۝ by his daughter Samira are in part about how the movie camera can estrange and intensify the reality it discloses to the viewer. Actual events in the world ��� the aftermath of an earthquake in a rural village a violent encounter between a policeman and a student radical a bizarre episode of family dysfunction ��� are not simply documented in these films but are also re-enacted interpreted and argued about as the cameras roll. Cinema is both a transparent lens and a distorting mirror and using it as a tool to examine the facts of human existence makes it impossible to take any of those facts for granted." argumentative movies an intellectual high that accompanies and sometimes magnifies their emotional impact. Though ���A Separation�۝ is not as formally self-conscious turning as it does on competing views and after-the-fact reconstructions of a contested event it works in a similar vein." notably ���The Circle �۝ ���Crimson Gold�۝ and ���Offside �۝ which add a vigorous dose of pointed and passionate social criticism. His contribution to Iranian cinema in the past decade has been to bring matters of class gender and social alienation into the foreground with tact as well as with anger." it is perhaps not surprising that the forces of reaction singled out Mr. Panahi for punishment even though (or perhaps just because) they knew that persecuting him would raise an international outcry. ���This Is Not a Film �۝ smuggled out of Iran last year to be shown at Cannes and other international festivals has done important work in keeping the rest of the world aware of the Iranian situation." Mr. Panahi�۪s unclassifiable intervention in the world�۪s collective imaginative life would be equivalent to a committee-written letter to The New York Review of Books. It is so much more than that so much more than a simple act of protest against oppression partly because it looks like quite a bit less." elegant apartment that might be the home of a cosmopolitan middle-class intellectual anywhere in the world full of books art high-end electronics and other nice things." whose family is visiting relatives chats with his lawyer on the phone tends to his daughter�۪s pet iguana and watches bits of some of the movies he made back when he was permitted to practice his profession. He sometimes lets his anxiety and fatigue show but mostly he seems to regard his situation with stoicism and a measure of amusement. He is clearly more accustomed to observing and reflecting on the actions of others than to being the center of the action." turning a highly personal video diary into a charged and expansive historical narrative. There is no plot (it�۪s not a film after all) but there is nonetheless an amazing twist at the end followed by a quiet tremor of awe." to tell you the truth since my job is to review movies and this obviously is something different: a masterpiece in a form that does not yet exist."

It�۪s happening again in ���Tyler Perry�۪s Good Deeds �۝ but with a smidgen of the humor and a much weightier moral reach. If ���Pretty Woman�۝ is a Disneyfied tale of the Cinderella prostitute and her corporate-raider prince ���Good Deeds�۝ offers bullet points from Charles Dickens and Oprah Winfrey in sketching out a similar but oh-so-serious fairy tale this time of a homeless janitor and her wealthy savior." which isn�۪t at all a bad thing and it�۪s not without moments of genuine feeling. But by the film�۪s end after watching a seemingly infinite number of dour close-ups of sober self-evaluation I felt bludgeoned by thesis-driven dialogue and noble intentions." the director the writer and the star ��� has vision and talent and deserves to reach an audience with his relationship films (���For Colored Girls �۝ for one). As the protagonist Wesley Deeds he nails the flat mien of his character�۪s depression trapped in a prison of good-son duties. If only Mr. Perry the director had encouraged Mr. Perry the actor to flavor his performance with anything beyond on-the-nose gravity. The use of a bad-son brother played by Brian White with staccato anger not only has its own problems it also underlines the unrelieved obviousness of Wesley�۪s decency." the women of ���Good Deeds�۝ often rise above that approach. Phylicia Rashad as Wesley�۪s status-conscious mother cuts like a sterling-silver knife but she registers a range of subtle emotions before the stabbing (or the crying which to no one�۪s surprise she does by the end)." the life-changer for Wesley Deeds (as in ���Pretty Woman �۝ she saves him right back) Thandie Newton deserves applause as well. This lauded actress often rises above her material and she does so repeatedly in the first half of the film with desperation but brittle pride as she loses her home and security. Ms. Newton�۪s work with the young Jordenn Thompson as her daughter is touching; together they make all clich̩s of troubled mothers and sweet daughters seem forgettable because this pair has truthful pathos." however ���Good Deeds�۝ is on a familiar train and we can guess every stop along the way. Well not quite: I didn�۪t anticipate how much the sentimentality of the closing scenes set to Richard Marx�۪s cloying 1989 hit ���Right Here Waiting �۝ would make me cringe." a shrouded attack on a woman and scenes of a little girl in crisis."

So when Jill�۪s sister mysteriously disappears behaving like a complete lunatic is probably not Jill�۪s best move." Ms. Seyfried belongs to a stable of blank-faced saucer-eyed beauties whose limited appeal may conquer the small screen but so far has failed to tame the large. In almost every scene she delivers a frantic one-note performance that neither capitalizes on the character�۪s complicated medical history nor appears to be remotely connected to anyone else in the story."

When she first bursts into a humble Le Havre hotel disheveled and in need of a hairbrush along with shoes the porter Dom (Dominique Abel) doesn�۪t seem surprised. That�۪s true even when calling herself Fiona (Fiona Gordon) she says that she�۪ll grant him three wishes. Dom a simple soul or maybe a simpleton asks for a moped and a lifetime supply of gas. Perhaps the filmmakers ��� Mr. Abel Ms. Gordon and Bruno Romy shared the writing and directing ��� were worried about running on empty." partly because he doesn�۪t seem much of a dreamer no matter if his head has taken up permanent residence in the clouds and partly because this movie might be a lot shorter. As it is waiting for Dom to decide on a third wish (Fiona keeps telling him to take his time) soon becomes something of a running ��� if more accurately dawdling meandering and at times almost forgotten ��� joke. That�۪s because the wishes are merely a pretext for the bits of silly business and old-fashioned pantomime the funny walks and goofy dances at the heart of this gentle movie which borrows some of its best moves and laughs from the film clowns of the silent era." ���The Fairy�۝ shares some of that film�۪s qualities for good (funny and sweet) and bad (sentimental and ingratiating). The performances in each are body based with the actors largely expressing themselves physically both in their gestures ��� a highly arched brow a right-angled leg ��� and faces as exaggerated as masks. There�۪s dialogue in ���The Fairy �۝ however if not much and most of what�۪s said is beside the point of its bodies ��� at rest or more often in stretchy choreographed motion. It�۪s no surprise that Mr. Abel who�۪s Belgian the Australian-born Ms. Gordon and Mr. Romy a French native share a background in the theater and in the circus." either because he�۪s the first one she�۪s come across in the outside world or because the two of them look as cozily built for each other as mating herons. With her receding almost reluctant chin and thrust-out chest ��� she sometimes appears to be moving in opposite directions at once ��� Ms. Gordon looks particularly birdlike and is especially fun to watch. When she sprints as during a cleverly extended and funny chase sequence after she steals some shoes she keeps her upper body straight as a board as if Fiona�۪s very torso were trying to deny the fact that she�۪s fast on the lam." by all appearances unintentionally suggesting that the filmmakers could use some help when it comes to continuity. The three are modest if not inexpert and have clearly watched their share of movies by the Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki (���The Man Without a Past�۝) the king of comic despair. Mr. Abel Ms. Gordon and Mr. Romy work in a lighter less ambitious key. They like neat frames centered compositions loud colors and slow burns. And while there�۪s not much in ���The Fairy�۝ that will surprise you if you�۪ve seen their previous screen collaborations including ���The Iceberg�۝ and ���Rumba �۝ there are moments here like a pregnant belly that swells up and deflates as abruptly as a party balloon that amuse."

but not so deep as to stain the screen. The American director Joshua Marston who shot the film in Albania doesn�۪t show the knife doing its work but instead focuses on the attenuated violence that comes after rippling out and expanding until it engulfs all the characters. The Albanian tradition of blood feuds partly inspired Mr. Marston to make this story yet what gives it shape are the more familiar conventions of the classic art film including narrative ambiguity ellipses and silence." the story turns on violence committed by a father paid for by his family and ripe with underdeveloped metaphoric promise given the country�۪s years of Communist dictatorship. One day while riding his family�۪s tiny horse-drawn cart the middle-aged Mark (Refet Abazi) comes yelling blustering face to face with a neighbor. The neighbor has blocked a road that Mark who sells bread from the cart to support his family uses as a shortcut. Words are exchanged some involving an unhappily shared history and soon Mark is on the run accused with a male relative of having killed the neighbor." or rather a gang of quarrelsome old men some with guns demands that the relatives of the accused suffer in turn a custom that becomes a prison sentence when Mark�۪s family members are forcibly confined to their house possibly for years." who after all were born to wiggle and roam (they share a single bedroom); and it�۪s frightening because the lives of the boys are threatened. In this harsh patriarchal world women register as second-class citizens with children even boys not far behind. Mr. Marston who wrote the script with an Albanian Andamion Murataj tries not to pass obvious judgment. You may anyway." the film largely examines the toll the blood feud takes on the children specifically the eldest the teenage Nik (Tristan Halilaj) and his somewhat younger sister Rudina (Sindi Lacej). Partly because Nik is confined to the house a limited playground for a bored teenager without many obvious interests beyond text messaging and a crush Rudina quickly becomes the more involving character. Ms. Lacej is in addition the stronger performer and when she�۪s on screen the stakes feel higher. Allowed to leave the house to sell bread Rudina helpfully opens the story up allowing you to explore the village its byways and people. And because of how she�۪s threatened by a relative of the dead man she becomes an instrument for vitalizing narrative tension." real locations minimal music and what looks like natural light Mr. Marston has worked hard at authenticity. (He shot his debut feature ���Maria Full of Grace �۝ about a Colombian drug mule mostly in Spanish.) He makes some fine filmmaking choices including the contrapuntal use of chattering teenagers of both sexes and muttering male elders a generational embodiment of the clash between the modern and ancient. Frustratingly though perhaps because he is an outsider and was concerned about appearing biased about another culture about all that Mr. Marston does is chew on this clash as if the repeated images of teenagers talking on cellphones next to a horse-drawn cart were a substitute for a strong filmmaking point of view."

There are after all only so many laughs to be had from the image of the naked actor Joe Lo Truglio letting his prosthesis hang and sometimes flop out." otherwise wearing only fur glasses boots and an occasional sanitary satchel (think of it as a hairnet worn lower) plays Wayne Davidson a writer and winemaker who belongs to an ���intentional community�۝ called Elysium. Tucked off a rural road Elysium was established decades earlier (Alan Alda wheelchairs in and out as one of the founders) and now is home to a group of men women and children many strumming guitars constantly. There�۪s a teepee in front along with a kaleidoscopic bus evoking the one Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters took across the country back in the flower-power day." when the road-weary Linda (a fine Jennifer Aniston) and George (a better Paul Rudd) stumble on Elysium they think that they�۪re tucking into another bed-and-breakfast. They go to sleep in 2012 or thereabouts only to wake in an idyll that time and information technology forgot ��� or so Mr. Wain and his co-writer Ken Marino insist as they wring as many jokes as possible out of the idea that organically grown blackberries and Blackberries are mutually exclusive. Good vibrations and sunlight fill the air and everyone wears a smile especially while wreathed in smoke. Initially leery Linda and George soon succumb to the commune�۪s charms and after an alienating detour at his brother�۪s McMansion decide to go back to nature Elysium-style." �۝ about kids and counselors at a 1980s camp ���Wanderlust�۝ hinges on the dynamics of a group effectively isolated in a country setting. The commune dwellers are willingly secluded having dropped out from the mainstream to follow their bliss or some such. Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily. Back in New York where she was a would-be documentary filmmaker and he did something that required wearing a suit they struggled living in an apartment (a ���microloft�۝) as big as a coffin and in which they�۪re nearly buried when he loses his job the real-estate market tanks and they end up broke." which breezily tracks Linda and George�۪s fall from Manhattan grace ��� from her comically bad pitch meeting at HBO to their packing up and hitting the road ��� is a pocketsize cautionary tale. Working with the editors David Moritz and Robert Nassau Mr. Wain gives this passage the kind of snap that brings to mind screwball films of the Depression era. The Great Recession it�۪s evident has started to inspire its own comedies so it�۪s too bad that Linda and George arrive at Elysium as quickly as they do. For all the raillery Mr. Wain and Mr. Marino squeeze out of the commune and its members including Justin Theroux as Seth a touchy-feely-creepy Lothario there�۪s something super-straight at times even fusty about how they see this world." yet like other Americans seeking simplicity and maybe a chicken coop out back they want off the road at least for a while. There�۪s something touching about this desire though Mr. Wain doesn�۪t let Linda and George fly their freak flags for long. This seems less of a fear of a vegan planet and more a question of boys being boys." the filmmakers prefer penis jokes and with Mr. Lo Truglio and Mr. Rudd�۪s help they provide plenty. Ms. Aniston and the other women (including Michalea Watkins as a desperate housewife) try to keep up but ���Bridesmaids�۝ notwithstanding the women�۪s liberation movement in comedy has yet to arrive on the big screen." expletives and hallucinogens."

Even so while she�۪s 14 going on 15 and three or so inches going on four Arrietty seems bigger because her courage along with her fluid form and softly dappled world come by way of the famed Japanese company Studio Ghibli where little girls rule if not necessarily as princesses." but it�۪s never been an issue at Ghibli where girls have long reigned without the usual frou-frou in films like ���Spirited Away�۝ and ���Ponyo.�۝ In keeping with that tradition a tiara and pink tulle don�۪t make Arrietty special: her size and especially her bravery do as evident when early on she sprints across a yard with a few leaves and a sprig of flowers while being chased by a cat that looks like a furry blowfish.

The Clocks live under the floors of the human cottage yet the home they�۪ve cobbled together from borrowed bits and purloined pieces is as cozy as the one upstairs." Mr. Yonebayashi fills in this hidden realm with fanciful dollhouse detail both in the Clock quarters ��� where a clay flower pot serves as the hearth and postage stamps hang like paintings ��� and in the shadowy interiors where Arrietty nimbly scaling steps made of nails first learns the art of the steal from her father Pod (Will Arnett)." unsurprisingly for Ghibli is lush and inviting by turns a dense jungle and an impressionistic landscape washed in gradations of green and flecked with red yellow and purple. Ghibli still uses hand drawings along with computer-generated imagery though it shuns 3-D animation the near-ubiquitous process in which models of characters are scanned three-dimensionally or created directly in a computer. What the studio does brilliantly is preserve a hand-drawn look and feel in its work as in the exteriors in ���The Secret World �۝ where the characters pop against a painterly meadow. Computers create extraordinarily photorealistic visuals but here the human touch deepens the story�۪s themes of loneliness friendship the need for home and for being literally held." the story doesn�۪t have the richness of the visuals or the complexities of the book which has been read as being about the struggles faced by Britons after World War II. There�۪s also a smidgen too much shrill comedy with Hara a busybody housekeeper (Carol Burnett) and with Arrietty�۪s nervous mother Homily (Amy Poehler)." as in the book but also something like impossible romantic foils.

That�۪s especially true when in an example of astute filmmaking choices you see the players lingering impatiently or forlornly on the sidelines and wearing mouthguards that look like pacifiers.

Ms. Witherspoon doesn�۪t register as the yielding type.

In Southern California drivers find their standards of living eroded now that they are independent contractors rather than unionized workers. The Indonesian and Filipino crews on board the giant container ships and the workers in the Chinese factories that fill them come from a vast pool of the poor and the displaced willing to work long hours in harsh conditions for a chance to buy into the consumer economy they serve." a sustained Marxian indictment of 21st-century capital. The narration by Mr. Sekula is at times lyrical and rarely subtle but the film is most graceful and moving when its argument slows down or wanders into an interesting tangent." like an extended rhetorical attack on the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao Spain the filmmakers seem to be riding an ideological hobby horse down a dead-end street. But they have a good visual instinct for the sublimity as well as the ugliness of the industrial and postindustrial environments and a patient and generous interest in what people have to say about their own lives." but the testimony of seamen factory workers and residents of a California homeless encampment is at the heart of the film�۪s guiding ethical and aesthetic principles which have to do with the defense of human dignity in the face of a system that so often appears hostile or indifferent to it."

He is only 56 part of a generational cohort of filmmakers that includes Spike Lee Olivier Assayas and the Coen brothers who all retain an aura of youthfulness in middle age." he has also seemed like a time traveler in modern cinema an ̩migr̩ from an older middle-European world of literature and philosophy or to go a little further a medieval stone carver who happened to get his hands on a camera." �۝ a slow and solemn black-and-white film set in a 19th-century wilderness and inspired by an anecdote involving Friedrich Nietzsche displays Mr. Tarr�۪s uncompromising atavistic commitment to darkness difficulty and lapidary pictorial sublimity. The movie may also dispel any skepticism about the finality of his decision to abandon his vocation since it is hard to imagine a more thorough and systematic statement of intellectual despair. Bela Tarr may be the happiest man in the universe but the universe as he depicts it is a harsh and cruel place indifferent if not actively hostile to the striving of human beings and other dumb animals." deep-focus tracking shot of a man and his domestic beast of burden trundling across a desolate landscape in a howling windstorm. A narrator has already recounted the story of how Nietzsche while in Turin Italy one day in 1889 witnessed a cart driver beating a recalcitrant horse and threw himself weeping on the animal�۪s neck." this event signaled the onset of a mental breakdown from which Nietzsche never recovered. The dementia that consumed the last years of his life was more likely caused by syphilis than by anything to do with a horse but in any case Nietzsche�۪s fate is tangential to ���The Turin Horse �۝ which is concerned with the driver whose few utterances suggest that he is Hungarian rather than Italian." and what follows ��� seven days in the life of the horse his owner and the owner�۪s daughter ��� is a kind of Genesis story in reverse an account not of the world�۪s apocalyptic destruction but rather of its step-by-step de-creation. The wind continues to howl and existence seems to grind to a halt as darkness swallows everything." as it is in most other end-of-days movies. (Lars von Trier�۪s ���Melancholia�۝ and Jeff Nichols�۪s ���Take Shelter�۝ are recent examples.) In Mr. Tarr�۪s version the abyss is already here and his task is less a matter of prophecy than of careful recording." who live in an isolated house with a dirt floor and a wood-burning stove are circumscribed by the routines of survival. Each day brings a series of tasks undertaken with ritualistic gravity from the shots of plum brandy (one for her two for him) at breakfast to the boiled potatoes (one for each of them with a sprinkle of salt for Dad) that make up their main meal." but cutting ��� or for that matter making anything go faster ��� is antithetical to Mr. Tarr�۪s methods. There are only around 30 shots in the 2 hours 26 minutes of ���The Turin Horse �۝ and it has like certain musical compositions the power to alter your perception of time. Mr. Tarr wants us to see to feel just how long things take to experience the weight and density of time in an austere technology-free setting." after all even poor people smiled told jokes and had conversations. And reminders of a wider brighter human reality intrude now and then on the domestic solitude of ���The Turin Horse �۝ in the form of a philosophizing neighbor and then of a wagon full of gypsies whose boisterousness seems both seductive and threatening." meanwhile remains a passive weirdly tender presence and its refusal to budge or to eat which threatens its owner�۪s livelihood begins to feel like a form of metaphysical resistance as well as a plain frustrating fact of life." nightmarish seven-hour ���S��t��ntang�_�۝ and the wintry ���Werckmeister Harmonies�۝ ��� the heaviness was punctuated by incursions of the grotesque and the surreal which may be why he has described them as comedies. Next to them ���The Turin Horse�۝ is a pared-down sinewy parable as clear and simple as Fred Kelemen�۪s exquisitely lucid monochrome cinematography but also as layered and mysterious as Mihaly Vig�۪s jaggedly romantic score." and ���The Turin Horse�۝ is an example ��� an exceedingly rare one in contemporary cinema ��� of how a work that seems built on the denial of pleasure can through formal discipline passionate integrity and terrifying seriousness produce an experience of exaltation. The movie is too beautiful to be described as an ordeal but it is sufficiently intense and unyielding that when it is over you may feel along with awe a measure of relief.

in case you had forgotten ��� you are told that it was ���inspired by true events.�۝ There is always a lot of latitude in such a claim and no one would accuse this mild soggy romance of excessive realism. But a cautious desire to remain somewhere in the neighborhood of plausibility also robs the movie directed by Michael Sucsy from a script with four credited authors of the opportunity to capitalize on the weirdness and extremity of its premise." Paige and Leo ��� the dimply and adorable Rachel McAdams and the decisively chiseled Channing Tatum ��� are an artsy young married couple enjoying a snowy evening in Chicago. Then a car accident sends Paige through the windshield and into a coma from which she emerges even more adorable than ever but also with amnesia. She does not recognize Leo and cannot remember anything of their four years together the highlights of which (cute meeting at the Department of Motor Vehicles; hipster nuptials at the Art Institute; discreet sexy snuggles in their North Side loft) we have already seen in flashbacks." she was estranged from her wealthy suburban parents. She had dropped out of law school to become a sculptor and dumped a skinny fianc̩ named Jeremy (Scott Speedman). Now that old life threatens to reclaim her. Mom and Dad (Jessica Lange and Sam Neill) are not crazy about Leo who runs a recording studio and spouts random bits of rock-�۪n�۪-roll trivia at the dinner table and Jeremy still carries a torch. Paige meanwhile having lost her touch with clay lightens her hair and trades in her bohemian garb for preppier attire. ���She�۪s turned into this sweater-set-wearing mojito-drinking sorority girl �۝ Leo complains to a friend." which is fine. But the movie�۪s commitment to the blandest possible presentation of its central problem starts to seem perverse after a while. This could have been a rich strange melodrama; a psychological thriller; a horror movie; a dark comedy; or any combination of these and scholarly viewers can relieve the tedium by imagining it remade by more daring filmmakers. Just think of what Alfred Hitchcock or Pedro Almod�_var or Luis Bu̱uel or John Waters could have done with this material." not shock. But even by the standards of commercial melodrama it�۪s a pretty weak brew. Ms. McAdams and Mr. Tatum have both done time in the Nicholas Sparks school of tragico-preposterous inspiration ��� she in ���The Notebook�۝ with Ryan Gosling he in ���Dear John�۝ with Amanda Seyfried ��� and they have the longing looks slow teardrops and lip trembles down cold. When they are on the screen together here there is enough physical charm and emotional warmth to distract from the threadbare setting and the paper-thin plot. But those defects ultimately get in the way of the stars and leave you wondering: Is this a romance about neurological impairment or a neurologically impaired romance?" with the notable exception of Ms. Lange whose one longish scene is the film�۪s only moment of eccentric unpredictable passion. Otherwise stuff just seems to happen and not much seems to be at stake which is odd given that the movie�۪s ostensible subject is the complex interplay of heart and brain." in two different ways.

tough visceral action movie ���Safe House�۝ a side character describes a rogue superagent played by Denzel Washington as ���the black Dorian Gray.�۝ Now that�۪s a movie pitch in waiting. Mr. Washington or rather the mystery man he plays Tobin Frost a former operative for the C.I.A. lets out a short self-aware laugh of a man who isn�۪t just fielding a compliment but also owning it fully. And why not? He looks good and he knows it." but if he�۪s feeling any of the aches and pains of age it doesn�۪t show. ���Safe House �۝ a ���Bourne�۝-esque story about the bad bad things that agents sometimes do in the name of country and company puts Mr. Washington through his action-flick paces. He runs he punches he runs he punches and occasionally discharges a gun either coldly (it�۪s just business) or with the slight look of disgust of a man cleaning off the bottom of his shoe. Tobin Frost ��� the name smacks of airport spy fiction ��� isn�۪t really the enigma the filmmakers would like you to believe but Mr. Washington is so good at suggesting deep reserves of cool moody mystery and smoldering feeling that he keeps you nicely guessing." the young up-and-coming Swedish director put into nimble play almost as soon as ���Safe House�۝ gets going. And after some low-key place setting in Cape Town where Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) an untested C.I.A. agent is watching over a company safe house the movie takes off like a shot. Frost having just snaked his way through the city dodging a gun-toting shooting horde and setting citizens scrambling every which way has slipped into the American Embassy and after announcing his identity been swept away by agents to the safe house for debriefing." switching not simply between two scenes but also upward of four. In lesser hands this kind of editing scheme can devolve into visual and narrative chaos as the filmmaker whiplashes from one location to another sometimes for no apparent reason. Working with the editor Richard Pearson whose credits include ���The Bourne Supremacy �۝ Mr. Espinosa maintains a visually coherent narratively rational sense of time and space no matter how fast the story shifts about which it does with increasing speed when that same heavily armed horde that had been chasing Frost breaches the safe house slaughtering most of the American operatives and sending Frost and Weston running." the story ebbs into more familiar cynicism rather than building toward political complexity. ���Safe House�۝ is essentially and very effectively a rollicking smash-and-crash chase movie that happens to be surprisingly well acted. Mr. Washington it almost goes without saying is its anchor; when he�۪s on screen everything seems to matter more so much so that a prequel seems inevitable. How Frost became the man that he did is one of the mysteries as is how well Weston and the actor playing him will rise to the occasion. Mr. Reynolds whose curiously unsettled career is its own puzzle rises here to meet Mr. Washington�۪s challenge investing Weston with a slow-building believable vulnerability." which oscillate between heavily populated sequences and small-scale fights in tight tight spaces though it�۪s his work with the actors and his attention to beauty that puts ���Safe House�۝ a cut above the genre rest. The supporting cast which includes Brendan Gleeson Vera Farmiga Rub̩n Blades and Robert Patrick does its part too as does the cinematographer Oliver Wood who it�۪s worth noting also shot all three ���Bourne�۝ movies. The world the filmmakers say again and again is a terrible place and yet as you look at this film with its beautifully bleached-out palette and somewhat coarse visual texture ��� the images look as if they had been lightly sandpapered ��� it�۪s hard not to be struck by its loveliness."

But this kind of movie is all about the special effects.

Shuttling between Havana and New York and conveying the blend of soul and scholarship that signifies true jazz devotion the film brings alive an almost unimaginably rich and resonant moment in musical history. The fictional couple at its heart ��� star-crossed lovers and sometime artistic collaborators ��� encounter bad luck in various forms but Chico and Rita also have the good fortune to mingle with real-life legends like Dizzy Gillespie Thelonius Monk and the great Cuban conga player Chano Pozo a crucial figure in the era�۪s mixing of styles and genres." an event that injects a jolt of surreal gangster brutality into ���Chico & Rita.�۝ The movie was directed by Fernando Trueba a filmmaker responsible for the crucial Cuban-jazz documentary ���Calle 54�۝; Javier Mariscal a Spanish artist and designer; and Tono Errando Mr. Mariscal�۪s brother. It is a piquant collage of moods and colors its buoyant fantasies shadowed by tragedy and loss." longing and laughter ��� can be experienced in the music which combines a few vintage tunes with new compositions by Bebo Vald̩s the great Cuban-born pianist and composer. Mr. Vald̩s now 93 is also the physical and biographical inspiration for Chico (voiced by Emar Xor O̱a) whom the film imagines in his vigorous prime and also in dignified old-age obscurity shining shoes and sipping rum in a shabby Havana apartment." its crumbling present-day streets giving way to the gaudy carnival of prerevolutionary decadence. In those days Chico and his roly-poly manager Ram�_n (Mario Guerra) bounce from rough-edged nightclubs to swank hotels looking for creative and sexual opportunities. One night he is smitten by a caramel-skinned blue-eyed honey-throated chanteuse named Rita (who speaks in the voice of Limara Meneses and sings in the sublime cadences of Idania Vald̩s). She catches Chico�۪s eye and ear and they begin a love affair that will encounter the full melodramatic range of reversals and obstacles. Chico�۪s jealous girlfriend his roving eye a sugar-daddy promoter from up north and antiphonal political forces named Jim Crow and Fidel Castro ��� all conspire to keep the lovers apart and the audience�۪s eyes damp." this is mainly because of the limits of the movie�۪s graphical style which emphasizes the undulating sensuality of bodies and faces at the expense of emotional precision. The real life of the animation is in the backgrounds especially the streets of Havana which are exquisitely rendered and meticulously colored. The filmmakers spent several months shooting on location in Havana and their care produces a vision of the place that is both lyrical and realistic." evoking a tradition of show-business romanticism at least as old as the first version of ���A Star is Born�۝ (and as fresh as ���The Artist�۝) even as it takes note of some of the cruel facts of history. Chico and Rita both Cubans of African descent must deal with discrimination and exploitation as they pursue fame fortune and artistic fulfillment." �۝ nominated for an Academy Award as the best animated feature is a reminder not only of the aesthetic vitality of hand-drawn two-dimensional animation but also of the form�۪s ability to provide entertainment and enlightenment for adults. A costume drama or a documentary would not have been as charming or as surprising. It would be hard to get cameo appearances from Charlie Parker or Marlon Brando and the dutiful literalism of historical filmmaking would have dampened the vitality and killed the magic."

weathered faces that stare out of the past in ���The Miners�۪ Hymns�۝ at times look as if they were carved from granite. They were in truth created in the coal pits of County Durham in northeast England. From the middle of the 19th century until the 1990s Durham was the site of hundreds of collieries with atmospheric names like Akleyheads Pit and Yew Tree Drift. These days the local tourist industry pushes the region�۪s natural beauty and charming towns (as of spring 2010 67 percent of its work force was in the service sector) and the Durham tourism board can even suggest a half-day sightseeing jaunt that takes you from a castle to a former colliery village." �۝ an elegant elegiac found-footage work from Bill Morrison best known for his silent-film reverie ���Decasia.�۝ Unlike ersatz ���found footage�۝ flicks like ���Paranormal Activity�۝ that involve no found footage and often no film (invariably these distractions are shot and shown digitally) this is the real deal having been constructed from original filmed images. (Alas ���The Miners�۪ Hymns�۝ is being presented digitally.) A miner himself of a type Mr. Morrison has dug into the archives of the likes of the British Film Institute to cull primarily black-and-white images so rich so alive with dirty faces shadows and the occasional pit pony that they resurrect a world that for many has long been lost to history." the camera gliding over washed out swatches of green and row upon row of identical looking houses. Every so often Mr. Morrison punctuates this view with text indicating that this or that swatch was the site of a former colliery and gives the date of its closure. This proves a rare instance of overt authorial presence beyond the inclusion of the moody mood-painting score by the Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson. Unlike mainstream documentary filmmakers Mr. Morrison doesn�۪t like to explain much ��� there are no guiding voices or additional text ��� even if it quickly becomes evident that he has a story to tell that stretches from the dawn of the 20th century to near its dark close." it appears to be a tale of work and of men wrenching treasure out of the earth�۪s depths though there�۪s play here too mostly in scenes from the annual celebration called the Miners�۪ Gala. (Women and children worked in coal mines aboveground but they�۪re mostly sidelined here.) Soon as Mr. Morrison gently skips around in time a historical narrative emerges as the images shift from what looks like the early 1900s deeper into the century. Clips from the galas are mixed in with shots of men laboring first with hand tools and then with machines that shave coal off the tunnel walls like ice seemingly rendering human effort almost if never entirely superfluous. Some late images of massing police and busloads of what may be scabs gesture toward the story�۪s eventual end." ���The Miners�۪ Hymns�۝ makes for enthralling if also somewhat frustrating viewing. It�۪s understandable why Mr. Morrison wouldn�۪t want to clog up these beautiful images with banal information say about death rates and strikes but the absence of such directorial input gives the material an ahistorical quality that�۪s at odds with the difficult sometimes brutal violent and still-living history behind these images. It would make quite the double bill with ���The Iron Lady �۝ the recent historically fanciful trifle about Margaret Thatcher who helped crush the miners�۪ union in the 1980s. ���The Miners�۪ Hymns�۝ is the better far more satisfying work and in its Film Forum engagement it comes with some dividends: three of Mr. Morrison�۪s earlier shorts all of which also consist of skillfully clearly lovingly manipulated older material that originated on film."

A preternatural self-confidence and buoyancy infuse every syllable out of Ms. Channing�۪s mouth in this entertaining film which is crammed with show business lore that dates to her discovery of her original idol Ethel Waters singing ���Supper Time�۝ in the 1930s Irving Berlin revue ���As Thousands Cheer.�۝" though Ms. Channing has been in a number of movies most notably ���Thoroughly Modern Millie �۝ in 1967. ���This creature with huge saucer eyes gigantic red lips and a massive smile �۝ as the comedian Bruce Vilanch describes her is her own special creation. With her fake eyelashes and raspy yawp of a voice she has inspired many a drag queen imitation.

shrieking haunted-house amusement and a solid addition to the recently resurrected Hammer Films ��� the company where Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing once reigned ��� ���The Woman in Black�۝ makes the most of its old-fashioned virtues. Duded out in a period frock coat and pocket-watch chain for his first post-Potter film role Daniel Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps a British lawyer who years after his wife Stella (Sophie Stuckey) died in childbirth has the haunted eyes of the eternal mourner. It�۪s no wonder too given that Stella a beauty in luminous white periodically hovers around him either because she�۪s a ghost or a figment of his enduring longing and grief." based on a 1983 novel by Susan Hill and adapted by Jane Goldman (who had a hand in writing ���Kick-Ass�۝ and ���The Debt�۝) weaves together a compendium of familiar themes. Arthur�۪s employer who�۪s all but run out of patience with his doleful solicitor gives him one last chance to prove his worth: he�۪s to travel to the remote village of Crythin Gifford to sort out the large estate of a woman who�۪s recently died. So Arthur parks his son with the nanny boards a train and heads straight into the creeping mists and mysteries of an isolated hamlet where the children scatter when he approaches and the adults have darts in their eyes if not pitchforks in hand." of course slowly and at times with unsettling effectiveness. It seems there�۪s a ghost troubling the area haunting the estate and sowing great misery though appearances like apparitions can be deceiving. Bewilderingly most of the villagers treat Arthur with unexplained hostility glowering and slamming doors. Undaunted he secures a sympathetic ally in a friendly local Mr. Daily (Ciaran Hinds) ��� who drives a Silver Ghost Rolls-Royce indicating along with the clothing that the story takes place between 1907 and the start of World War I ��� and a strange confederate in Mr. Daily�۪s dotty wife (Janet McTeer enjoying herself). With their aid Arthur begins poking about the estate that set high on an isolated marsh comes with both gravestones and spooks." Mr. Watkins fills the film with squeaking doors and floorboards pools of black long silences and an assortment of moldering toys. Less gore is more here and what a relief. ���The Woman in Black�۝ isn�۪t especially scary but it keeps you on edge and without the usual vivisectionist imagery. Mr. Watkins doesn�۪t paint the screen red; he daubs it on a restraint that serves his slow-building story and creates a nice chromatic contrast with a palette that�۪s heavy on white black dun brown and gray. Here when a young girl chokes up a spittoon of blood the red splattering across her creamy pale skin the image keeps on giving." sympathetic center for the tale even if the ghost of Potter past hovers in his every gesture. Despite Mr. Radcliffe�۪s best efforts (including the choice to go period) the lingering Potter effect is only natural given that Hogwarts was the actor�۪s training ground. It will take time before many of us will be able to see the actor instead of his famous character and time for him to shake that role off too though it helps that Mr. Radcliffe is no longer encumbered by Harry�۪s mop and especially his glasses. A movie actor�۪s eyes can be his most expressive tool one that Mr. Radcliffe who has a pretty blue pair framed by thick brows ��� the eyes suggest watery lightness while the brows convey a heavy weight ��� wasn�۪t able to make full use of as Harry." �۝ but Mr. Watkins�۪s smartest choice is to make use of Mr. Radcliffe�۪s long tenure as an action star. There isn�۪t much by way of dashing heroics here but Arthur is almost continually on the move including during a successful long and nearly wordless interlude in which he wanders through the vacated estate its snaking hallways locked and suddenly unlocked rooms alive with scraping rasping and murmuring. At times Arthur looks so small engulfed in all that darkness and so helpless much like one of the children who haunt the story without investing it with much feeling. With Mr. Watkins�۪s creeping camerawork it�۪s Arthur who keeps the story steadily moving forward inch by inch shiver by shiver."

�۝ says Luke (Pat Healy) a sad-sack employee at a creaky New England hotel who has just scared his colleague Claire (Sara Paxton) with an Internet video. The clip is a sub-���Paranormal Activity�۝ prank a long fixed shot with something ghoulish popping suddenly into the frame. I didn�۪t just spoil it because what Luke says is true: There are some very simple things you can do with a camera that are guaranteed to frighten whoever is watching." the director of ���The Innkeepers �۝ a movie about Luke and Claire and their haunted workplace is well versed in the tricks of horror. He is part of a generation of young filmmakers who are rediscovering and refining the basic vocabulary of the genre. But the amateur video Luke shows to Claire like the investigative pseudo-documentary he might make himself if his camera were working is not Mr. West�۪s kind of thing." this approach produces queasy trompe-l�۪oeil immediacy." �۝ like ���The House of the Devil �۝ Mr. West�۪s 2009 baby-sitter-in-peril movie is the work of a more classical sensibility. It generates suspense and fright through ancient techniques of framing cutting and focus. There are long slow tracking shots down shadowy corridors. Point of view is manipulated to imply unimaginable terrors at the edge of the screen. Doors fly open and slam shut. The soundtrack picks up echoes and inklings of dread amplified by the audio recorder Claire and Luke use to detect ghostly signals." as if taking its cue from Luke and Claire ���The Innkeepers�۝ does not seem to work very hard. What distinguishes it as a new-breed horror movie is the minimalism of its story and the abrasive aimlessness of its main characters. Luke who looks like a gone-to-seed Tintin sliding slack and unshaven into his 30s is only slightly less passive than Claire who seems to be sustained by the faltering sense of her own cuteness." a sad old hotel that we visit in its last weekend of operation. The only guests are an angry woman (Alison Bartlett) with her young son and Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) a former television actress who has become a New Age healer with a spiritual devotion to vodka. Leanne befriends Claire which is to say that she quickly comes to find the younger woman ��� who somehow manages to be both mousy and pushy ��� intensely annoying." from ���Psycho�۝ to ���Halloween�۝ to ���Saw �۝ have frequently had a punitive element. The slashers psychos demons and revenants who populate (and depopulate) the genre punish sexual promiscuity greed cruelty and other vices though the innocent are also persecuted. Luke and Claire are guilty above all of being dumb and bored. Even their interest in the ghost that may dwell in the dark corners of the Pedlar seems tepid and lacking in conviction. The movie clever and rigorous though it is feels that way too." a version of the grouchy imperious weariness that Ms. McGillis conveys so artfully when Leanne is confronted with Claire�۪s immaturity. Jolting and impressive as Mr. West�۪s skills are there is something missing from ���The Innkeepers�۝: an element of metaphysical awe or psychological implication that might make you temporarily believe in ghosts or even care about what they do. But there is nothing much here beyond idle curiosity and superficial scares." but enough to inspire profanity."

Adam Pesce�۪s ���Splinters�۝ is a bit of both with less gloss but stronger ethical impact. A real-life examination of competitive surfing in Papua New Guinea the film derives tension from the proverbial big tournament but also from how the event helps foster a worthy morality." whose winners will go to Australia to train with world-class wave riders. Signing up are the proud aggressive Angelus Lipahi and the earnest hardworking Ezekiel Afara both inspired by glossy magazine images of surfing superstars. The married Angelus is accused of fathering and financially neglecting children by a woman who is not his wife; on the eve of the competition she threatens police action." with more at stake. Both are sick of having their surfboards (splinters in indigenous slang) stolen by local men. The fiercely driven Lesley in particular says she resents the housebound drudgery expected of women and the endemic domestic abuse invariably accompanying it. Not all of these players win in this capable account of their struggles but all contribute to a valuable lesson in fair play."

�۝ Nora Ephron�۪s demi-dessert about Julia Child and the wildly less interesting blogger who toiled and troubled her way through one of Child�۪s cookbooks. More recently there was ���Snow Flower and the Secret Fan �۝ another bifurcated movie about women in separate epochs one a past in which women are imprisoned by law and broken feet the other a present in which they�۪re burdened by ennui and high heels. Now there�۪s Wally & Wallis or rather ���W.E. �۝ Madonna�۪s fiction film about Wallis Simpson and an old-fashioned-minded modern miss who yearns to wear the duchess�۪s kid gloves smell her perfume and luxuriate in her kind of love." but it�۪s hard to know what to make of this mini-trend. Does such cinematic communing with past female lives trace back to ���The Hours �۝ the Stephen Daldry movie based on the Michael Cunningham novel? In both that book and its film adaptation Virginia Woolf�۪s ���Mrs. Dalloway�۝ serves as the pivot for three women (Woolf included) from three eras whose lives over the course of a day unfold in something like transcendent synchronicity. Whatever you think of the novel and specifically the film the stakes ��� sexuality and identity life and death creation and being ��� are high for all three women." �۝ which involves the intersection of two lives that of Mrs. Simpson (Andrea Riseborough) who married the Duke of Windsor and a contemporary haute-bourgeois New York hausfrau Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish). The story is as simple as its telling is tortuous: Wally unhappily married to a hotshot doctor William (Richard Coyle) has developed a fixation with Wallis Simpson. Wally�۪s story takes place oddly in 1998 though the combination of her deluxe digs and her stiff-lipped anguish within its wood-paneled walls ��� she�۪s an exotic bird fluttering in her gold cage ��� is straight out of one of Lana Turner�۪s desperate melodramas. Sidelined by the apparent whims of her husband Wally spends her time dreaming about Mrs. Simpson who regularly materializes in flashback." where she worked before her husband forced her to quit. It�۪s curious that the director Madonna one of the most publicly independent women of the late 20th and early 21st centuries would create a character with the spine and personality of a soggy noodle. It�۪s also unfortunate because Wally doesn�۪t stand a chance against the strangely transfixing Mrs. Simpson. The same holds true of Ms. Cornish a lovely blur of an actress who here melts into misty memory every time Ms. Riseborough enters ��� her Wallis slithering across the screen all silk satin and sex ��� to pierce the bosom of her hapless consort." Edward (James D�۪Arcy) never stood a chance or so it seems. Certainly whether crowned or not he doesn�۪t hold much interest for Madonna who wrote the script with Alek Keshishian. (Mr. Keshishian directed or just tagged after her in ���Madonna: Truth or Dare.�۝) Early in ���W.E.�۝ you hear a tinny female voice wafting from the ether to wax breathless about the Windsors. ���Some people called it the greatest love story of the 20th century �۝ the voice announces adding that ���the romantic legend lives on today.�۝ Well maybe though you wouldn�۪t know it from the attention Madonna instead lavishes on Wally and Wallis who initially intersect through the crosscutting and then ��� as their respective bad times worsen ��� begin speaking to each other across time and space." Madonna has come up with a female friendship movie which would be fine if she weren�۪t busy trying to prove her art-film bona fides. At her entertainer best Madonna distilled ideas and emotions into solid pop gold transmitting a worldview through songs music videos and her shape-shifter persona. The movies by contrast have largely defeated her both as an actress and as a director. As a mystical female friendship movie ���W.E.�۝ has its pull but it never coheres shredded by its editing and its pretensions like Mrs. Simpson dancing to the Sex Pistols with a woman in African tribal regalia because I�۪m guessing Madonna likes the way Sofia Coppola used New Order�۪s music in ���Marie Antoinette.�۝" who would have done better to stick with the past. (Even if history doesn�۪t interest her: Wally waves away accusations that the Windsors were Nazi sympathizers because they visited Hitler in 1937 two years it should be mentioned after Germany passed the Nuremberg Laws.) Ms. Riseborough is a strong enough presence that she could hold your attention for an entire movie and her absences are keenly felt especially when Madonna becomes preoccupied by Wally�۪s relationship with a sensitive security guard with puppy eyes Evgeni (Oscar Isaac). The duke swept the duchess off her feet or vice versa but from the way Madonna�۪s camera caresses Evgeni it�۪s obvious that her mind isn�۪t on anyone�۪s feet."

���Down Terrace �۝ with something altogether more implacable and strange the British director Ben Wheatley has gained confidence in his handling of male violence and domestic distress. That assured style is the spackle that holds ���Kill List�۝ together: when the plot doglegs into insanity and the characters follow suit this brutal fever dream refuses to fall apart." botched assignment in Kiev two former army types are picking up the pieces. The moody volatile Jay (Neil Maskell) is working out his kinks in screaming rows with his Swedish-born wife (MyAnna Buring) while the easygoing Gal (Michael Smiley) urges him to accept another job. With money running low and a young son to feed Jay agrees though not until we meet their new employer and he slices Jay�۪s palm to seal the deal do we understand what the men have signed up for." ���Kill List�۝ compels with a dreamy approach to violence that infuses everyday situations ��� a spousal tiff or an informal dinner party ��� with undercurrents of pulsing claustrophobia. Evil stalks these characters from within and without though what it might look like we only gradually discover. When we do we are not completely satisfied: why is Gal�۪s new girlfriend (Emma Fryer) drawing strange symbols on the back of the bathroom mirror? And why is a priest so grateful to be facing a bullet?" psychodrama and religious rot the unconventional script (by Mr. Wheatley and Amy Jump) idiosyncratic editing and v̩rit̩ photography somehow cohere.

whose deepening sense of foreboding is sustained by the enigmatic pseudo-biblical reflections of an unseen narrator." �۝ she intones. ���There is light. There are men and women. There is food.�۝" as an epidemic sweeps the planet depriving human beings of one sense then another and another." directed by David Mackenzie (���Young Adam�۝) from a screenplay by Kim Fupz Aakeson is also the love story of a rakish chef Michael (Ewan McGregor) and Susan (Eva Green) a chilly epidemiologist recovering from a broken heart. After a casual hookup Michael dismisses Susan by explaining that he can�۪t sleep in the same bed with another person. Susan who is furious belongs to a medical team studying the case of a man who has suddenly lost his sense of smell. He turns out to be one of the first of millions of Britons who become afflicted." the victims have fits of inconsolable grief that evoke the connection between smell and memory." the loss of which is preceded by ravenous animalistic bingeing on whatever is at hand. In his restaurant kitchen Michael gulps from a huge jar of mustard. Frenzied colleagues stuff slabs of raw meat into their mouths; one drains a huge bottle of olive oil. In another part of the city Susan who is carrying flowers frantically tears into them with her teeth." ���Perfect Sense�۝ is also a dour celebration of the ability to adapt. At his restaurant Michael compensates for the absence of smell and taste by focusing on the texture and color of the food and soon all is more or less back to normal. But there are limits to adaptation and when the third wave of the disease hits affecting hearing it triggers worldwide chaos. Deafness is preceded by outbursts of violent rage. Michael who has reconnected with Susan suddenly turns on her with contempt." �۝ ���Perfect Sense�۝ doesn�۪t trump up a halfhearted medical analysis of the disease. As in ���Children of Men �۝ where the world is gripped by an epidemic of infertility the ailment here is also metaphorical. It could be a global spiritual malaise or a dire warning from above though the story refers neither to religion nor to God. The narration (voiced by Katy Engels) offers few clues beyond the admonition expressed in vague tepid language to appreciate life and to remember as Joni Mitchell sang ���You don�۪t know what you�۪ve got till it�۪s gone.�۝" shedding their defenses and clinging together feels forced and sentimental. Although the story doesn�۪t carry its conceit to its logical conclusion its implication that in a nightmarish future these two might be a new Adam and Eve redeemed through catastrophe gains little emotional traction."

It�۪s a classic pop creation in that its hook ��� three teenage boys mysteriously acquire fantastic powers ��� seems fresh even if the whole thing feels inspired by someone�۪s Netflix queue: a revenge-of-the-outsider tale like Brian De Palma�۪s ���Carrie�۝; the first-person perspective of ���The Blair Witch Project�۝ and ���Cloverfield�۝; and average Joes turned super-Joes as in the television shows ���Heroes�۝ and ���No Ordinary Family.�۝" �۝ written by Max Landis and directed by Josh Trank who together came up with the story warms up slowly. (Mr. Landis 26 is the son of the director John Landis best known for horror films like ���An American Werewolf in London�۝; Mr. Trank also 26 has worked as a film editor including on ���Big Fan.�۝) It opens with Andrew (a very good Dane DeHaan) the only child of a raging alcoholic father (Michael Kelly) and a mother who�۪s dying at home (Bo Petersen) recording himself in his bedroom mirror with a digital camera. The mirror hangs on a door that�۪s shaking because dear old drunk dad likes to play the Big Bad Wolf." Andrew has decided to record everything in his life or at least the highlights. Banalities like bathroom visits and classroom lessons don�۪t make the final cut but a party that his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) coaxes him into attending does. After the usual cacophony of beats and revelry and the introduction of an obligatory female lust object Casey (Ashley Hinshaw) the movie gets down to business. Along with a popular student Steve (Michael B. Jordan) Max takes Andrew over to a large hole in the ground. My what a big mouth it has. Laughing dizzy from booze and high on youth the boys enter the void dropping down down into the black." �۝ and that the filmmakers will mine the cavity�۪s depths for all its psycho-sexual terror instead of settling for a boy�۪s super-neato adventure. No such luck. Mr. Landis certainly is clever ��� the garrulous Matt who looks and sounds as if he�۪s in college name drops Schopenhauer Jung and Plato ��� but these citations are largely self-aware icing on a genre cake. Early on Matt explains to Andrew CliffsNotes style Schopenhauer�۪s concept of will vaguely paving the way for the actions and themes to come. The hole the boys soon discover has left them with extraordinary powers including telekinesis gifts that eventually lead to a battle between untamed will and choice." he soon goes dark and then darker. From the start there�۪s an undertow of cruelty to the teenagers�۪ high jinks as they learn what they can do as when they levitate a stuffed animal to frighten a child. Mr. Trank brings a light touch to these self-discovery scenes ��� the three are flexing fast-evolving muscles ��� as well as a creeping sense of menace." Mr. DeHaan whose vulnerability and physical awkwardness here can evoke the young Leonardo DiCaprio in ���What�۪s Eating Gilbert Grape �۝ is invaluable. Mr. Russell and Mr. Jordan are as likable as their characters but it�۪s Mr. DeHaan who pulls you uneasily in." or rather his cameras which gives the opening section a grubby smeary consumer-level digital video look. After he loses his original camera though and somehow obtains a better one improving the image quality (and how! the movie was shot with an Alexa which can start at $60 000) he increasingly uses his telekinetic powers to operate his new toy. The superhero stuff is all fine and good enough but it�۪s this vision of a lonely boy with his swooping dipping flying Tinker Bell of a camera that truly lifts the movie." a car accident super-violence and death."

Also lending hands are a Greenpeace worker two Minnesotans with a portable de-icer the Alaska National Guard the Reagan administration the Soviets and even a journalist or two." but once revved up it becomes an involving work-against-the-clock-and-the-odds action movie. Inspired by actual events from 1988 the film shows the race to save the whales and comes with a family-friendly reach-across-the-aisle message: When people put aside politics and ill will they can accomplish something they could never manage alone." and it is sentimental enough to have those characters changed by their commitment to the cause. The oilman (Ted Danson) wants the good publicity he gets from helping. He also falls in love with the whales and even finds that his nemesis the Greenpeace activist Rachel (Drew Barrymore) isn�۪t so horrible after all. (Back at ya says Rachel.) But bad things do happen.

It uses three voice-over narrators who break in at seemingly arbitrary moments to hasten the story along. If these insertions help the movie sustain its pace they also sometimes feel like annoying interruptions." late in the movie a dispassionate narrator describes the toll of the ordeal on Rom̩o and Juliette�۪s relationship and it feels like a shortcut that has skipped over some crucial dramatic events. Recurrent visual effects evoking medical procedures are more jarring than enlightening. The screenplay only alludes to the catastrophic medical bills faced by the couple." which encompasses Vivaldi Laurie Anderson (���O Superman�۝) a lush ���Manḥ de Carnaval�۝ (from ���Black Orpheus�۝) and grating punk rock vividly underlines the characters�۪ mood swings.

���Miss Bala�۝ tells the strange seemingly impossible story of a Mexican beauty queen who becomes the accidental pawn of a drug cartel. It�۪s an adventure story that could be called a contemporary picaresque if it weren�۪t so deadly serious and might be called fantastical if it weren�۪t loosely based on a true story of a former Miss Hispanic America. One day a beautiful young woman Laura (a sympathetic Stephanie Sigman) is trying to enter a Miss Baja contest; a few hours later she�۪s cowering in a nightclub dodging gunfire and gangsters who bequeath her another title Miss Bala ��� Miss Bullet." their S.U.V. loaded with cash and guns. Ms. Z̼̱iga was soon anointed Miss Narco by Mexican newspapers and the American news media had its fun too. Time magazine ran an article about her with the headline ���Busted! Taking Down Miss Hispanic America �۝ embellishing it with a glamour shot of her in a gown her bosomy cups running over. Her arrest as Time put it provided ���some variety in the news for a nation weary of piles of corpses and vicious firefights in its relentless drug war.�۝ She was soon released and while she lost her pageant crown unlike some casualties of the drug war she did keep her head." which he has liberally expanded on but his tone remains almost relentlessly sober. It�۪s no wonder: According to the Mexican government more than 47 000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calder�_n began deploying the military against the cartels in 2006 a number that makes the body count in the film seem conservative. Even so while Mr. Naranjo adds some real grim statistics to the fictionalized mix he doesn�۪t try to legitimize the story with documentary verismo. Instead working from a script he wrote with Mauricio Katz Mr. Naranjo gives ���Miss Bala�۝ the pulse of an action film the tears of a telenovela and a heroine who easily shoulders the metaphoric weight of a people living under siege." her character�۪s resilience and the actress�۪s committed performance undergird that frail form. With her father and brother Laura sells clothes for a living. The promise of a prize and a better life for her brother helps explains why she tries out for the pageant though Mr. Naranjo isn�۪t big on expository details or character motivations. Rather he plunges you into the story without much background or explanation and lets you get up to narrative speed as events unfold and characters enter. With his camera close on Laura�۪s heels and sometimes behind her glossy head he faithfully follows her around including to the pageant audition where she meets her friend Suzu (Lakshmi Picazo) and is accepted as a contestant." which makes it look as if she were seated in the row in front of you ��� she enters a shadowy cavernous dance hall and then a dark room with a dazzlingly white back wall. As she gazes at the figures silhouetted against the wall you realize that this brilliantly staged sequence visually evokes the passage from dimmed theater wings to lighted stage. At which point in a tense creepy scene the cartel invades the club and starts shooting the place up killing many including partying drug enforcement agents. Laura escapes but only after the cartel�۪s leader Lino (Noe Hern��ndez) takes notices of her." it turns out has a role to play ��� the cartel the police the military the dead in the streets ��� and some roles pay so well that the show is unlikely to close soon. The stage metaphor that Mr. Naranjo introduces at the nightclub certainly could have been an empty self-reflexive gesture but instead it deepens the film�۪s meaning especially after Laura is forced by the cartel to join in its intrigues. There�۪s a performative aspect to the cartel as when it clears a street like a film crew readying a shoot. More important even as Laura transforms from an extra into a star from an audience member to a player her suffering becomes palpably real." �۝ a 2008 Italian drama about the Neapolitan Mafia the virtuosity of the filmmaking in ���Miss Bala�۝ can make it feel exhilarating even as the everydayness of the violence its tragic banality forcibly brings the film down to red-stained earth. This is a Mexico in which gangsters face off against the police in daytime machine gun to machine gun turning a city street into a nightmare of war. The brutality in ���Gomorrah�۝ can be unnerving scary. If it feels as if there�۪s more at stake in ���Miss Bala �۝ that�۪s because Mexico is so close and Laura is too. By keeping her so near that you seem to share the film frame with her each time she takes a blow Mr. Naranjo shows how terror becomes familiar and intimate. This is domestic violence on a national scale."

the phrase ���action movie�۝ is a bit redundant. Really what else are motion pictures for? In the earliest days of cinema our ancestors were thrilled to behold images of galloping horses hurtling trains and capering dancers. Though our entertainments are now more elaborate our appetites are not so different. A large part of what we crave is action: running jumping fighting driving flying. Sometimes everything else ��� plot character emotion ��� can seem superfluous." �۝ a cold and kinetic experiment in high-impact low-concept genre filmmaking directed by Steven Soderbergh.

Mallory is a professional black-ops superwarrior (at least I think that�۪s what her business card says) whose troubles are a reminder of just how dangerous it can be to mix work and romance. To say too much about the guys she deals with would be to risk inflaming the spoiler-sensitive but her dealings with them frequently end and sometimes begin with punches and kicks though there are also occasional kisses and job interviews." which she explains to one of the few men not implicated in it a young fellow named Scott (Michael Angarano) whose chivalrous intervention in that diner melee plunges him into a welter of mayhem and high-speed exposition. As Mallory drives Scott�۪s car toward the next showdown a flurry of flashbacks explains the significance of certain proper nouns notably Aaron Paul Kenneth and Barcelona." here represented by Michael Douglas. Aaron (Channing Tatum) did a job with Mallory in Barcelona where things got a little complicated. So that takes care of that. Further complications turn out to involve Antonio Banderas and Michael Fassbender (who is Paul but that�۪s enough for now). Apart from Scott the only man Mallory trusts (there are no other women in the world of ���Haywire�۝) is her father (Bill Paxton) a former Marine (as is his daughter) with a wonderfully cinematic and conveniently isolated house in New Mexico." scene of an intricate and suspenseful foot chase that serves as Mr. Soderbergh�۪s critique of current trends in action filmmaking in particular those associated with the British director Paul Greengrass. Instead of the splintered speeded-up cutting favored by Mr. Greengrass and his followers ��� most memorably deployed in the second and third ���Bourne�۝ movies which turned the cities of the world into Google Earth kaleidoscopes of controlled chaos ��� Mr. Soderbergh builds momentum and uncertainty through extended tracking shots and tight restricted perspectives. Like Mallory the audience can�۪t see everything that�۪s happening and isn�۪t sure what will happen next." though nothing is really in doubt and very little is at stake. Unlike the ���Bourne�۝ films whose baroque webbing of plot and counterplot suggested an allegory of global paranoia ���Haywire�۝ goes to great lengths to avoid being about anything beyond its immediate situations and effects. It is self-consciously and aggressively trivial a feast for formalists who sentimentalize the gloriously cheap B-movies of the past." street food trashy films. But knowing sophisticated attempts to replicate those things often traffic in their own kind of snobbery confusing condescension with authenticity. Movies like ���The American �۝ ���Drive�۝ and now ���Haywire�۝ offer strained pulp neither as dumb as we want them to be nor as smart as they think they are and not in the end all that much fun." strictly speaking very little of it. Her expressions run the gamut from glower to pout and her features give little indication of her character�۪s inner state." but her blankness also contrasts with the nimble slick pretending of Ms. Carano�۪s male co-stars. Their professionalism manifests itself in different ways ��� Mr. McGregor and Mr. Douglas are practiced hams while Mr. Fassbender prefers to keep kosher ��� but in each case there is a fascinating awkwardness to their encounters with Ms. Carano who is a more purely physical screen presence. (She and Mr. Tatum on the other hand have the chemistry of shared clumsiness.)" which makes her performance like the porn star Sasha Grey�۪s in Mr. Soderbergh�۪s ���Girlfriend Experience �۝ an intriguing curiosity and something of a conceptual puzzle. Once the talking stops and the action begins her professionalism is very much in evidence and exciting to watch. And yet somehow it cannot quite relieve the tedium of a movie that is too cool even to pretend that there is anything worth fighting about."

(���The Sacred Star of Milos�۝ is the sequel.)" I�۪m afraid). So for the uninitiated: when Ed and Al�۪s mother died Ed used the forbidden practice of human alchemy to bring her back but at a dear price. He lost an arm and a leg and Al lost his body. Now Al inhabits a robotic frame (resembling a shorter spiked cousin of the title character in ���The Iron Giant�۝) and Ed uses high-tech prostheses. The two seek a philosopher�۪s stone (not to be confused with the British title to the first Harry Potter book) that will enable them to reclaim their bodies." poor people oppressed by the Cretans who live above. There the brothers join forces with the Milos as well as with Julia a budding alchemist and her mysterious brother Ashleigh. Let the animated phantasmagoria begin: explosions bolts of enchantment and colorful conflagrations signifying little to this viewer." early steampunk flavorings including the Black Bats ��� flying female antagonists in Art Deco regalia ��� have charm.

In each case the graceful movement of particular bodies ��� at rest at work in rehearsal and in performance or competition ��� provides a counterpoint to the frenzy and inertia of the collective bodies in which they dwell." which opened in Paris in 1951 offers a particularly French blend of sophistication and vulgarity. The choreographers and directors speak in high-flown philosophical terms that don�۪t seem nearly as profound or as sexy in the English subtitles. It�۪s true that some of the numbers like the club itself have English names ��� ���Baby Buns �۝ to take one example ��� and that many are accompanied by Anglo-American pop songs of eclectic vintage. But the grinding teasing and undulating are shrouded in gauzy Gallic abstractions that would be out of place at your local pole-dancing emporium: l�۪̩rotisme la s̩duction la beaut̩ le d̩sir." for all its familiar gentlemen�۪s club trappings ��� Champagne bottles in buckets of ice on each table; enough red velvet to wrap all the bridges and monuments in Paris ��� takes itself seriously as an artistic endeavor. Crazy Horse�۪s director Philippe Decoufl̩ is as passionate about the integrity of his vision as any filmmaker or playwright and his collaborators are if anything even more ardent. Ali Mahdavi the fluttery talkative artistic director (Mr. Decoufl̩�۪s lieutenant and to some extent rival) declares that the French government should make attendance at Crazy Horse mandatory for all citizens as an educational experience and an acknowledgment of the institution�۪s place in the nation�۪s cultural patrimony." good-humored dancers under his and Mr. Decoufl̩�۪s command. But putting on the show is a lot of work and Mr. Wiseman�۪s particular genius has always been to convey through judicious editing and dogged filming the tedium busyness and quiet intensity of group labor." but also with a delicious sense of prurience the film takes us into the costume shop and the dressing rooms where the nakedness of the performers is a matter of fact rather than display. We watch auditions hearing the physiques of aspiring dancers discussed with unsparing candor and witness rehearsals where the attention to detail is almost comical. We also greet the customers one evening: a lot of tourists a lot of couples a hum of unembarrassed anticipation." will be a matter of taste. Mr. Wiseman a master of cutting and composition is adept at providing aesthetic information without passing aesthetic judgment. It is possible to watch ���Crazy Horse�۝ in a state of baffled reverie seduced by the fine-grained attention to technique and dubious about the merits of what the technique produces. Some of the dances at least as captured on film are both pretentious and beautiful.

bountiful life has inspired an expansive understandably hagiographic documentary ���Sing Your Song.�۝ Silky voiced and snake hipped with a supernova smile that dazzled Americans and helped demolish racial prejudices he remains perhaps best known for his lilting version of the Caribbean folk tune ���The Banana Boat Song�۝ (���Day-O�۝) a requiem for the exhausted working man. Given his decades of tireless globe-sprinting crusading ��� alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and African activists alike ��� it�۪s clear that Mr. Belafonte rarely embraced the plaintive refrain of ���Day-O�۝: ���Daylight come and me wan�۪ go home.�۝" �۝ which was directed by Susanne Rostock and produced by five people including the youngest of his four children Gina Belafonte. He was born in New York to Jamaican immigrants in 1927 ��� he turns 85 on March 1 ��� a hard start that as he writes in the recent ���My Song: A Memoir �۝ meant ���I was born into poverty grew up in poverty and for a long time poverty was all I thought I�۪d know.�۝ There were years of deprivations long interludes in Jamaica and an adolescent stint in New York passing as white so that his family could live in a restricted apartment building." ���Sing Your Song�۝ only skims the surface of Mr. Belafonte�۪s life ��� it also sometimes politely edges around it or just ignores the messier bits ��� but what a rich glossy surface it is the stuff of a bildungsroman. In 1944 at 17 he enlisted in the Navy where he soon discovered the writing of W. E. B. Du Bois who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Two years later Mr. Belafonte saw a play at the American Negro Theater in Harlem which gave black actors roles and opportunities denied them elsewhere. He was hooked and art and activism became the twin pillars on which he built his life." guided by Mr. Belafonte�۪s on-and-off narration you�۪re plunged into a swirl of names places productions causes and events. He was everywhere at once making news as a black performer with an increasingly large and accepting white audience and as a participant in the civil rights movement. In 1949 he began singing at the Royal Roost a New York jazz club where Max Roach and Charlie Parker were his backup. Then it was off to Broadway and a Tony in 1954 for the musical revue ���John Murray Anderson�۪s Almanac.�۝ TV and movie fame came next and with it wider exposure to an awakening America." a background that for the most part and especially at first serves her well in ���Sing Your Song �۝ which integrates original interviews with a wealth of archival material from home movies to newsreels and film and TV snippets (though not always with their correct aspect ratios). The interviews a Who�۪s Who of political and entertainment celebrity feature performers like Tony Bennett Ruby Dee Miriam Makeba and Sidney Poitier whose stories and star wattage are balanced by the heft provided by the likes of the historian Taylor Branch. All four of Mr. Belafonte�۪s children as well as his second wife Julie Belafonte also appear intermittently to plug in some holes and gently hint at the cost that his busy life exacted on the family. (His third wife Pamela isn�۪t interviewed.)" his oldest Adrienne once wondered tugging at her father?" as the years and milestones whoosh by it�۪s hard not to think if Mr. Belafonte�۪s extraordinary story might have been better served as a television special or at least a movie with a longer running time. His 1959 variety show on CBS ���Tonight With Belafonte �۝ which was sponsored by Revlon is alone worth a longer thoughtful look. Imagine what it must have been like to see and hear this seductive beautiful black man singing intimately into the camera invading homes across the country at a moment when segregation was still law. Mr. Belafonte won an Emmy for the show the first African-American to win the award." for a 1963 CBS special you see Mr. Belafonte discussing the march on Washington with some fellow marchers Mr. Poitier Marlon Brando James Baldwin Charlton Heston and the film director Joseph L. Mankiewicz. What�۪s startling isn�۪t just the seriousness or level of discourse (and that they�۪re smoking) but also their sincerity about effecting change at home. These days American stars tend to travel abroad ��� say to Sudan ��� to do good works perhaps because it�۪s easier to be engaged far from the trivializing of the entertainment media. Here and elsewhere in the documentary you are made to feel that such involvement is deeply American and necessary." though it�۪s hard to know whether Mr. Belafonte did too. The dates and causes start to blur and the years and events particularly as the early 1970s abruptly give way to the late 1970s confusingly pile up. Mr. Belafonte�۪s activism increasingly shifted to Africa where he campaigned against hunger and inspired the making of the album and the video of ���We Are the World �۝ the maddeningly kitsch-catchy song that raised millions. He slowed down lost his hair (it keeps coming and going in the contemporary interviews) and found new love but he kept plugging away at his causes his hopes and his dreams walking his walk and talking his talk."

When Bobby is with his mother in their humble apartment swatting at a mouse with a broom or taking a punch from his mother�۪s squeeze (Joe Pantoliano) he seems to be in a movie about a working-class regular guy trying to get by.

�۝ a film about a middle-aged rock �۪n�۪ roll Sherpa who�۪s lost his job and moorings there�۪s a jumpy viscerally uncomfortable scene in a motel room ��� a tempest fueled by booze and coke old grudges and new hurts ��� that�۪s so strong and beautifully played that it lifts the movie out of its doldrums. A roadie Jimmy Testagross (a gruffly tender Ron Eldard) has crawled back to his childhood home in Forest Hills Queens after being cut free by his longtime employer Blue Oyster Cult. From his wounded look it seems as if he weren�۪t only fired but also stripped of his identity. Refusing to admit the truth even to himself he tells everyone he�۪s the band�۪s manager." the sagging-gut analogues to all those bright young men struggling and invariably finding their ways despite the odds their families and circumstances. As his name implies Jimmy (it�۪s impossible to imagine anyone calling him James) hasn�۪t fully grown up at least in the conventional sense of what it means to be an adult (no wife no brood no house). He�۪s throwing a tantrum when the movie opens yelling into his cellphone about his old job and kicking a wall. There�۪s something juvenile about his outrage ��� he�۪s a hothead but with none of an adult man�۪s menace ��� an immaturity that implies weakness." as becomes clear from his interactions particularly with his mother simply known as Mom (Lois Smith) and an old high school bully Randy (a very fine blustering Bobby Cannavale). A large initial stretch of the story involves Jimmy�۪s awkward reunion with his mother who�۪s happy to see him and angry that it�۪s taken so long for him to visit. These scenes fill in the background and its bedeviling ghost (photographs of Jimmy�۪s dead father outnumber the religious tchotchkes) and vividly get across why it�۪s taken so long for Jimmy to return to that claustrophobic nest with its puce accent notes and tough love." its awkwardness extends to the filmmaking. One problem is Jimmy and his mother�۪s dialogue which continues in the same clich̩d vein as the opening scenes of him alone yelling and yammering into his cell. People talk in platitudes and their lives follow the same story beats as countless fictions. But when early on Jimmy yells that he was ���the best roadie you ever had�۝ and the next word out of his mouth is a questioning ���hello �۝ it doesn�۪t simply indicate that the other party�۪s hung up on him but also that the screenwriters the director Michael Cuesta and his brother Gerald Cuesta aren�۪t working hard enough." most painfully during an ungainly conversation between mother and son that�۪s an argument for a ban on over-the-shoulder shots. Such shots are usually deployed when two characters are having a conversation. When the focus is on one character the camera is placed right behind the second one�۪s shoulder (here it hovers behind the characters�۪ backs like a waiting servant); when the second character talks the camera moves behind the other person and so on. It�۪s a device that�۪s meant to make you feel part of the conversation but when it�۪s as clumsily used as it is here it can pull you right out. Mr. Cuesta whose films include ���L.I.E. �۝ is better than this inept scene." Nikki (Jill Hennessy also nice). Nikki and Jimmy were once close and as they lean into each other in his old bedroom a time capsule lined with pictures of guitar gods and crammed with vinyl dreams you see hear and feel the film come alive. Mr. Eldard who brings layers of complication to his character makes Jimmy�۪s vulnerability palpable while Ms. Hennessy shows you her character�۪s carelessness and opportunism. Nikki who�۪s playing out her rock-star fantasies by warbling at a local bar thinks that maybe Jimmy can do something for her. But Jimmy despite his attenuated outlaw-biker getup is too soft for real-life ugliness which becomes clear in that motel room scene that shows you just what Mr. Cuesta can do." violence and rock �۪n�۪ roll."

Yes there were casual hookups then but they were not called that in the late 1960s when the story takes place. Romantic sex still bore a mystical aura." an earnest brooding Japanese college student and Naoko (Rinko Kikuchi) the onetime sweetheart of his best friend Kizuki who committed suicide the camera studies the delicate curves of their lips merging in a near-sacred rite of communion. It is Naoko�۪s 20th birthday and her loss of virginity is an earth-shaking event deepened by their shared unspoken grief." when Watanabe brings up Kizuki�۪s name for the first time Naoko collapses in tears and confesses that her sexual unresponsiveness to Kizuki whom she had known since childhood was a source of anguish. She appears to blame herself for his suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning; otherwise his act would appear inexplicable." morbid aspects of youthful passion. Written and directed by Tran Anh Hung (���Cyclo �۝ ���The Scent of Green Papaya�۝) ���Norwegian Wood�۝ is his adaptation of Haruki Murakami�۪s much loved 1987 novel. It belongs to the same feverish mind-set as Scott Spencer�۪s novel ���Endless Love�۝ (not to be confused with its dreadful screen adaptation) in which young love is a divine but perilous form of insanity." Naoko disappears from Watanabe�۪s life until she contacts him from a rural sanitarium where she is recovering from a nervous breakdown. He periodically visits but after some hopeful signs Naoko�۪s fragile mental health deteriorates and she descends into schizophrenia." so to speak but is drawn back from the abyss by a second woman: the willful free-spirited Midori (Kiko Mizuhara) who is Naoko�۪s opposite. For Watanabe the women embody his inner tug of war between Eros and Thanatos." like the novel is narrated by Watanabe who looks back 17 years to his days as a college freshman in Tokyo. In Japan as in the United States and Europe it was a period of widespread student unrest. But the movie makes only token attempts to acknowledge campus ferment. One scene shows Watanabe caught up in a demonstration to which he is all but oblivious." but he is humorless and self-absorbed. His doomy romanticism is reflected in attenuated beautifully photographed scenes of times spent with Naoko at different seasons when the landscape and the turbulent weather conjure her emotional instability. Jonny Greenwood�۪s hovering music for string quartet and orchestra underlines the mood of seething emotional turmoil." surrounded by waves crashing on the rocks. He huddles quaking from the cold by a small bonfire. Except in this scene of his own solitary breakdown Mr. Matsuyama�۪s Watanabe is a glum opaque protagonist who registers few emotions beyond a desperate desire to protect Naoko who is susceptible to uncontrollable bouts of tears and seems increasingly unreachable." his eventual salvation is much less vivid and sexually outspoken in the movie than in the novel. When the film ends you barely remember her while Naoko�۪s fragility is portrayed as an exalted state of consciousness." Reiko and Tetsuji Tamayama is amusing as Watanabe�۪s classmate Nagasawa a chain-smoking dandified lothario who makes life miserable for his loyal girlfriend Hatsumi (Eriko Hatsune)."

death and the limits of knowledge ���Once Upon a Time in Anatolia�۝ has arrived just in time to cure the adult filmgoer blues. It was directed by the Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan whose earlier movies include ���Distant�۝ and ���Three Monkeys�۝ and who in recent years has emerged as one of the consistently most exciting directors on the international scene. His latest which shared the grand prize at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival takes the unassuming form of a police investigation that as miles and words mount evolves into a plangent visually stunning meditation on what it is to be human." if the journey less so. A man has been murdered and a small battalion ��� a doctor a prosecutor a few policemen several soldiers diggers with shovels and a transcriber with a laptop ��� has invaded the countryside with the suspect to dig up the body. The trouble is that the accused Kenan (Firat Tanis) claims to have been drunk when he committed the murder and can�۪t remember where he buried the body. And so off the men go in two cars and a Jeep driving up and down the sensuous rolling hills of Anatolia the enormous peninsula that constitutes most of Turkey and which the ancient Greeks called the land of the rising sun." pulling into a turn in the dirt road where a solitary young tree pierces the parched amber landscape like a shot arrow. Making the most of his wide-screen frame ��� a format made for landscapes like these and filmmakers as sensitive as this one ��� Mr. Ceylan initially keeps his distance from the characters by showing them in extreme long shot a vantage that accentuates how small they are in relation to the wide world enveloping them. This is the first in a series of stops that the men will make as again and again they look for the body in a search that reveals far more about the living than about the dead." pitted and smoothed faces of his travelers. Much like the stopovers during the search when the men clamber out of their vehicles these faces ��� including those of the doctor Cemal (Muhammet Uzuner) and the prosecutor Nusret (Taner Birsel) ��� are effectively narrative layovers breaks in the larger journey. There�۪s a murder at the story�۪s center but as one after another face fills the frame a tear violently trembling in one man�۪s eye while the memory of a dead wife hovers in another man�۪s look it becomes evident that the greater mystery here is of existence itself." including most obviously Leone�۪s 1968 masterpiece ���Once Upon a Time in the West.�۝ I don�۪t want to make strong claims about the influence of that or any other Leone film on ���Anatolia �۝ though the twinned landscapes of this movie�۪s natural vistas and the ugly beauty of its fantastic faces evoke Leone. (More than a few of Mr. Ceylan�۪s actors could outgargoyle Leone performers like Jack Elam.) Yet like most westerns ���Once Upon a Time in Anatolia�۝ is among other things an examination of violence and masculinity one in which women remain critical if largely off-screen figures silent if never truly mute." but lets them quietly surface often through the stories that the men tell one another and that at times take the form of parables. In one a driver Arab Ali (Ahmet Mumtaz Taylan) tells the doctor how he likes to drive to the countryside for target practice just to let off some steam. Enveloped in darkness the wind rising like sighs Arab Ali at first registers as a somewhat buffoonish borderline-dangerous character whose Hobbesian worldview (it�۪s shoot or be shot) is a reminder that this is after all a search for a murdered man. Yet like the doctor the prosecutor and the police chief Naci (Yilmaz Erdogan) Arab Ali proves more complex than he seems because his words are those of a man puzzling through the meaning of life." whose stories of lost wives and other ghosts drench the movie in an acute sense of loss one that is offset by the effulgence of the natural world a gift that none seem to see. The dead haunt ���Once Upon a Time in Anatolia �۝ but so does beauty. At one point after several futile attempts to find the body the men drive to a village. There they are greeted by its leader or mukhtar (Ercan Kesal) who amid a hospitable meal tells the travelers that the town needs a new morgue. Most of the young people have left he says and when an old villager dies they beg to see the dead one last time holding onto a past that fills them with longing.

Simin (Leila Hatami) wants to leave the country with her daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) and Simin�۪s husband Nader (Peyman Moadi) insists on staying at home in Tehran to care for his frail and elderly father who suffers from dementia and needs constant attention. Quite possibly there is more at issue than practical domestic arrangements ��� there are hints of suppressed anger in Nader�۪s demeanor of long-simmering exasperation in Simin�۪s ��� but an Iranian courtroom may not be the best place to discuss intimate marital matters." given that country�۪s strict censorship codes is an Iranian film. But ���A Separation �۝ written and directed by Asghar Farhadi (and Iran�۪s official Oscar submission) does not feel especially constrained. It is a rigorously honest movie about the difficulties of being honest a film that tries to be truthful about the slipperiness of truth.

She goes to live with her parents and he hires a young woman named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to help look after his father." who arrives with her young daughter has an anxious plaintive manner and her apparent unreliability brings minor irritation and then outright chaos into Nader�۪s life. Before long ��� and as a result of events I will leave for you to discover ��� Nader is back in court embroiled in long arguments with Razieh and her husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini) an unemployed shoemaker laden with debt and seething with resentment humiliation and angry piety." which often turns on forensic details and uncertain recollections is inflamed by social tension. In Hodjat�۪s eyes Nader and Simin are part of a corrupt and entitled elite arrogant and irreligious and full of contempt for an ordinary working man like him. And their attempts to be reasonable compassionate and polite betray an unmistakable condescension which Mr. Farhadi tacitly endorses by making Hodjat such a brute." as if the characters were pulled from a box of available types rather than painted in the shades of life. But there are also scenes that draw power from the subtlety of the performances in particular the quiet watchful portrayal by Ms. Farhadi (the director�۪s daughter) of a girl who is at once central and peripheral to the drama unfolding around her. Termeh shy and studious is desperate to please her parents and terrified that her family will collapse. Her parents and the audience continually overlook the intensity of her feelings which nonetheless pervade the film along with her unspoken hope that everything will work out in the end." and the film is remarkably deft in capturing the petty cumulative frustrations of modern city life. In addition to their weekly quota of quarrels and brooding silences Simin and Nader must contend with work (she is a doctor he has a job in a bank) their daughter�۪s schooling Tehran traffic (a touchstone of recent Iranian cinema) and an officious and sometimes chaotic government bureaucracy. Daily life is a cycle of waiting nagging negotiating and looking for a place to park much of it carried out with frayed and weary decorum. Even when everything seems to be falling apart people try to mind their manners." in this setting both a deeply ingrained habit and a public virtue eruptions of feeling ��� some of which come close to physical violence ��� arrive with special force in ���A Separation.�۝ And they leave a knot of ethical and philosophical questions that may make the walk home from the theater as argumentative as the film itself. Most of the characters�۪ behavior is viewed with sympathy and skepticism and the frequent bouts of legal wrangling invite endless interpretation of every aspect of the story.

pro or con about its subject the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher are likely to emerge in a state of greater ambivalence even confusion. Those who know or care little about her will also be confused but for different reasons." even more than her friend Ronald Reagan whereas the left saw her as a monster. There may have been some mixed feelings in the middle but she herself had little use for such wishy-washiness reserving special scorn for the ���wet�۝ and the ���wobbly�۝ on her own side." if the film is to be believed ��� and it is in its way a credible enough portrait ��� did she have much patience for the discussion or display of feelings of any kind. When a doctor asks the aging Thatcher (played with brilliant slyness and sly brilliance by Meryl Streep) how she is feeling he is answered with an impromptu lecture on the over-emotionalism of modern culture and a stout defense of the supreme importance of thinking. Ideas are what matter she insists and I suspect that a great many people of various ages and political inclinations would agree." who directed ���The Iron Lady �۝ and Abi Morgan who wrote the screenplay are among them. Though the film pays lip service to Mrs. Thatcher�۪s analytic intelligence and tactical shrewdness its focus is on the drama and pathos of her personal life. In her dotage watched over by professionally cheery minders she putters about in a haze of half-senile nostalgia occasionally drawn back into the glory and pain of the past." Thatcher is visited by the ghost of her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent) and by her daughter Carol (Olivia Colman). Carol�۪s twin brother Mark unseen in the film is far away in South Africa his distance emphasizing his mother�۪s loneliness and isolation. Denis�۪s shade is genial mischievous company but also a reminder of what has been lost and what might have been." behind a discreetly applied ton of geriatric makeup Ms. Streep provides once again a technically flawless impersonation that also seems to reveal the inner essence of a well-known person. Her portrayal of Mrs. Thatcher in power while equally impeccable is limited by the film�۪s vague and cursory treatment of her political career. ���The Iron Lady�۝ is above all the story of a widow and a half-abandoned mother who happened ��� didn�۪t you know? ��� to have been one of the most powerful and consequential women of the 20th century." to celebrate their heroine as a feminist pioneer while showing her to be tragically unfulfilled according to traditional standards of feminine accomplishment. On her first day as a member of Parliament Margaret (played in those early years by Alexandra Roach with Harry Lloyd as a smiling young Denis) pulls out of the driveway as her children chase after her car begging her not to leave them. Later she announces her intention to seek the party leadership on the day that Carol has passed her driving test earning a rare rebuke from her husband for putting herself first." communicating her acute awareness of sexism and class prejudice in a way that makes her eventual triumph inspiring. But as the film reckons the cost of this triumph to Mrs. Thatcher and her family it suggests that the double standards she fought against still flourish. In trying to make her more human more sympathetic the filmmakers turn a self-made highly original woman into something of a clich̩." which frequently turn artists into substance abusers and sexual adventurers who just happened to cut a few records or paint a few pictures on their way to redemption. ���The Iron Lady �۝ following this template makes a particular hash of British history compressing social and economic turmoil into a shorthand that resembles a chronologically scrambled British version of Billy Joel�۪s ���We Didn�۪t Start the Fire.�۝ (Miners�۪ strike/Falklands War/I can�۪t take it any more ... .)" which is conveyed by means of a few catch phrases and snippets of archival news footage. We learn that Mrs. Thatcher took on the unions the I.R.A. the Argentine junta and more than a few of her allies at times angering segments of the public to the point of insurrection while winning three consecutive elections a modern record. The cabinet meetings and backroom dealings are quite entertaining. Richard E. Grant as Michael Heseltine and Anthony Head as Geoffrey Howe stand out from the crowd of grousing toffs in chalk-striped suits though of course not as much as Ms. Streep. But it will be hard for anyone not familiar with the story to have much sense of what is at stake." beyond the challenge it poses for Ms. Streep its own reason for being is a bit obscure. It is likely to be the definitive screen treatment of Mrs. Thatcher at least for a while and yet it does not really define her in any surprising or trenchant way. You are left with the impression of an old woman who can�۪t quite remember who she used to be and of a movie that is not so sure either." some violence and nonsexual nudity."

Alike (Adepero Oduye) knows who she is and is eager to have her first lesbian experience. In one of the strongest scenes she persuades her best friend Laura (Pernell Walker) to buy a strap-on dildo for her which Alike then finds too uncomfortable to wear under her clothes at a local women�۪s dance club.

Allow your sped-up modern movie-going metabolism accelerated by a diet of frantic digital confections ��� including Mr. Spielberg�۪s just-released ���Adventures of Tintin�۝ ��� to calm down a bit. Suppress your instinctive impatience quiet the snarky voice in your head and allow yourself to recall or perhaps to discover the deep pleasures of sincerity." the old Hollywood adage goes you�۪ve got it made. But while ���War Horse�۝ is like so many of Mr. Spielberg�۪s films a work of supreme artifice it is also a self-conscious attempt to revive and pay tribute to a glorious tradition of honest emotionally direct storytelling. Shot the old-fashioned way on actual film stock (the cinematographer is Mr. Spielberg�۪s frequent collaborator Janusz Kaminski) the picture has a dark velvety luster capable of imparting a measure of movie-palace magic to the impersonal cavern of your local multiplex. An Interview With the ���War Horse�۝ Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski" in its early chapters also takes you back to an older ��� you may well say cornier ��� style of entertainment. Joey the fleet-footed headstrong half-Thoroughbred of the title is purchased at auction by Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan) a proud and grouchy Devon farmer with a tendency to drink too much. His household includes a loving scolding wife Rosie (Emily Watson); a cantankerous goose; and a strapping lad named Albert (Jeremy Irvine) who forms an immediate and unbreakable bond with Joey. The teenage boy trains the horse to pull a plow and together they ride through the stunning scenery." an experience so terrible he cannot speak of it to his son ��� and by social divisions. The Narracotts are tenant farmers at the mercy of their landlord (David Thewlis) and if ���War Horse�۝ pays tribute to solid British virtues of decency and discipline it also like a Thomas Hardy novel exposes the snobbery and economic oppression that are if anything even more deeply rooted in that nation�۪s history." more innocent world that is swept away by the war but rather a way of life whose contradictions are as emphatically presented as its charms. And what follows as Joey is taken across the English Channel to the battlefields and trenches of Flanders and France is a nightmare of cruelty that is not without its own sinister magic. Like most movies with an antiwar message ���War Horse�۝ cannot help but be enthralled by the epic scale and transformative power of military conflict. ���The war has taken everything from everyone�۝ ��� the truth of this reckoning uttered more than once by characters on screen is self-evident but it is complicated by the visceral charge and cathartic relief that an effective war movie gives to its audience." chaotic naturalism of ���Saving Private Ryan�۝ ��� this is an animal fable for children after all with echoes of ���E. T.�۝ and Carroll Ballard�۪s ���Black Stallion�۝ ��� but his ability to infuse action sequences with emotional gravity has hardly diminished." charging through the enemy ranks with swords in what appears to be a clean and devastating rout. But then at the edge of the field the German machine guns begin to fire and the British horses crash into the forest suddenly riderless and instantly obsolete. Joey who of course never sought out heroism in the first place is relegated to a life of brutal labor that seems fated to end in an ignoble death." human kindness and the companionship of a regal black horse named Topthorn. Joey�۪s episodic journey takes him from British to German hands and back again with a sojourn on a French farm owned by an elderly jam-maker (Niels Arestrup) and his young granddaughter (Celine Buckens)." meanwhile makes his own way to the war and his and Joey�۪s parallel experiences ��� harrowing escapes the loss of friends the terror and deprivation brightened by flickers of tenderness or high spirits ��� give the story texture and momentum as well as giving Mr. Spielberg an opportunity to show off once again his unmatched skill at cross-cutting. (The large cast mostly British and almost entirely male acquits itself admirably with a few moments of maudlin overacting and many more of heartbreaking understatement.)" Lee Hall and Richard Curtis have wisely avoided attempting to reproduce the atmosphere and effects of the stage production in which Joey and the other horses are portrayed by huge puppets. He prefers to translate the tale which originates in a novel by Michael Morpurgo into a fully cinematic idiom. And ���War Horse�۝ turns out to have a central Spielbergian theme ��� perhaps the dominant idea in this director�۪s body of work ��� namely the fraught and fascinating relationship between the human and the nonhuman. An Interview With Steven Spielberg" horses aliens dinosaurs intelligent machines ��� mean to us? What are we supposed to do with them? The boundary can be hard to maintain: sometimes as in ���E. T.�۝ and ���A. I. �۝ nonhuman beings are virtually impossible to distinguish from humans; at other times as in ���Amistad�۝ and ���Schindler�۪s List �۝ self-evidently human beings are denied that status. Sometimes the nonhuman is a threat at other times a comfort but it always presents a profound ethical challenge based in a stark existential mystery: Who are we?" and his taste for happy or at least redemptive endings is frequently criticized. But his ruthless optimism while it has helped to make him an enormously successful showman is also crucial to his identity as an artist and is more complicated than many of his detractors realize. ���War Horse�۝ registers the loss and horror of a gruesomely irrational episode in history a convulsion that can still seem like an invitation to despair.

The enclosures are repaired and expanded the bills and employees paid. Little Rosie takes to her new home swimmingly even as Dylan sulks and stomps about initially unreceptive to Kelly�۪s attentive cousin Lily (Elle Fanning).

Mr. Mee�۪s mother Amelia was in on the family�۪s grand adventure as was Mr. Mee�۪s wife Katherine who died shortly after.

Instead Mr. Crowe makes the escalating tension between Benjamin and Dylan the story�۪s soft center ��� a miscalculation. Dylan�۪s petulance registers as generically adolescent rather than anguished and his company wears thin partly because Benjamin�۪s doesn�۪t." groans and clich̩s of the screenplay which was written by Aline Brosh McKenna (���27 Dresses�۝) and reworked by Mr. Crowe are however finally outstripped by the attractiveness of the performers those with two legs and more and especially by the tenderness that Mr. Damon brings to his role. Mr. Crowe doesn�۪t linger over Benjamin�۪s despondency." he gives it gentle due in passages that remind you that there�۪s often a strain of melancholia in this director�۪s work a sadness that suggests that Mr. Crowe intimately knows the darkness and uses his movies as a way to resist (or deny) it.

Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese grand old men of baby-boomer Hollywood have made 3-D children�۪s tales (���The Adventures of Tintin�۝ and ���Hugo�۝) which is certainly noteworthy.

But the power and intelligence of Bausch�۪s approach which at times seems more cerebral than sensual is communicated. And there are moments when her discipline and Mr. Wenders�۪s visual instincts harmonize perfectly so that instead of enduring yet another well-meaning specimen of ���dance on film�۝ you are experiencing dance and film fully and simultaneously." ���Pina�۝ includes interviews with dancers their words dubbed over their silent contemplative faces.

that day has been revisited infrequently on American screens and with a circumspection that can feel like reluctance. Some moviemakers have probably shied away from the subject for fear of offending viewers; others like Michael Moore who directed ���Fahrenheit 9/11 �۝ haven�۪t worried about alienating a general audience because they�۪ve played to a specific constituency giving their viewers what they wanted to see and hear. ���Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close �۝ a new Sept. 11 movie takes a different tack from most of its predecessors by treating that day not as an occasion for personal sacrifice for national mourning or reflection but as kitsch." it stars the newcomer Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell an 11-year-old New Yorker whose father Thomas (Tom Hanks) died when one of the twin towers collapsed. The story kicks in with Oskar squirming in the back of a limousine while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) weeps at Thomas�۪s graveside. They�۪re burying an empty casket a dry-eyed Oskar says. He misses his father terribly but he has his own ritualized way of coping which includes keeping a secret shrine to Thomas gazing at photos and mementos and regularly conjuring his father in flashback." whose wide-ranging screenwriting credits stretch from ���Forrest Gump�۝ to ���The Insider �۝ the movie turns on a mystery presented by a key that Oskar finds in an envelope scrawled with a single cryptic word: ���black.�۝ With childlike (or a novelist�۪s) magical thinking he decides that this must be a message from his father. He also with a nudge from a locksmith resolves that ���black�۝ is someone�۪s name and that someone must have known his father. And so in an effort to hold onto Thomas longer Oskar packs a knapsack brings out his therapy tambourine (he plays it to keep anxiety at bay) and goes searching for Mr. or Mrs. Black a quest that takes him from one corner of New York to the next and into the trembling gentle embrace of its people." he refuses to take public transportation ��� from one borough to the next crossing one bridge and racking up untold miles. The unreality of any 11-year-old walking alone from his cosseted life on the Upper West Side to various points in Brooklyn and elsewhere gives the story a somewhat surreal almost fairy-tale quality. (Later you learn that his travels weren�۪t exactly the solo voyages they seemed to be.) During his excursions he meets a multi-everything multitude men and women who greet him with smiles tears hugs and prayers treating Oskar who claims to have a difficult time talking to people as a combination father confessor and veritable holy child." curious notions an extravagant vocabulary a mannered inclination toward metaphor (he calls Sept. 11 ���the worst day �۝ as he does in the novel) and a possible disorder (there�۪s a suggestion that he has Asperger�۪s syndrome) Oskar is himself the key to the story. He�۪s built to charm from his running mouth to his fast-flying feet and I suspect that how you react to him ��� or rather the manipulations of those pulling his strings ��� will greatly color your view of the movie. In real life he would be one of those children who inspire some adults to coo and cluck while reminding others of how grateful they are to be child-free. This being a movie however almost everyone reacts to Oskar with the same warm indulgence." a Brooklyn woman who�۪s crying when she throws open her door to him and who in a further twist of the emotional knife is played by that new saint of cinema Viola Davis. Abby it turns out is in the middle of a fight with her husband William (a fine Jeffrey Wright) who�۪s racing around the house and pointedly ignoring Oskar. Abby by contrast gives Oskar her attention and a photo of an elephant. Mostly she gives Oskar her tears which anoint her suffering face and baptize the story as one of universal suffering." even as you wonder why. Crying is one of the great pleasures of moviegoing but tears can be cheap. Much depends on your personal triggers how you respond to having them pulled who�۪s working those triggers and for what reason. In some movies a weeping woman is a routine clich̩ but when an actress like Ms. Davis cries it can feel very close to home. You may think about your own heartbreaks. And Ms. Davis a practiced weeper has herself become a trigger (all those snotty tears she wept in ���Doubt�۝). Max von Sydow who plays Oskar�۪s grandfather if more accurately his sidekick and who brings natural gravitas to any role is another." but there�۪s also an aestheticized re-creation of a falling man that�۪s mirrored with stunning imbecility by a shot of Oskar joyfully soaring into the air on a swing. There�۪s also a scene in which Linda after receiving a call from Thomas who�۪s trapped in one of the towers gazes in horror out her office window at the burning buildings. The shot is obviously composited but it�۪s nonetheless a jolt because the buildings reverberate so intensely. It�۪s this intensity ��� and our deep emotional responses ��� that the movie tries to appropriate for itself." whose earlier films include ���The Hours�۝ and ���The Reader �۝ has a gift for soft-pedaling the worst life has to offer. Working with the cinematographer Chris Menges Mr. Daldry brings a pretty glow to every face and room even during the story�۪s toughest moments. The performances including from the reliably appealing Mr. Hanks and Ms. Bullock are smoothed of any roughness which can be chalked up to the fact that most of the story is seen through Oskar�۪s eyes. Mr. Horn who was 13 when the movie was made is an attractively real-looking boy with an impish smile and a natural-feeling directness and he holds his own just fine even against a scene-stealer like Mr. von Sydow." ���Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close�۝ isn�۪t about Sept. 11. It�۪s about the impulse to drain that day of its specificity and turn it into yet another wellspring of generic emotions: sadness loneliness happiness. This is how kitsch works. It exploits familiar images be they puppies or babies ��� or as in the case of this movie the twin towers ��� and tries to make us feel good even virtuous simply about feeling. And yes you may cry but when tears are milked as they are here the truer response should be rage."

The lovely Roma (Priyanka Chopra) and her wise mentor (the great Om Puri) are on his trail though and he can�۪t trust his partners. It�۪s indeed an impossible mission (Don even uses a peel-away mask) in the jokey spirit of Danny Ocean." except most comics have nods to emotional depth. Don is a superenigma an anti-hero way too extraordinarily capable to take seriously which is fine when he�۪s doing something interesting (the big heist has twists stunts and suspense aplenty) and simply auto-action when he�۪s not (all those car chases and heck the first third of the film)." Farhan Akhtar seems out to create a spectacular international entertainment with ���Don 2 �۝ in a mix of Hindi and English and a dollop of German. And thanks to the unpretentious humor he is mostly successful though audiences will have to forgive the bland performances. Not the actors�۪ fault really; when a cocky chuckle (Mr. Khan) or determined lips (Ms. Chopra) are your only character bits you don�۪t have much character to explore. Only Kunal Kapoor as a more sympathetic colleague of Don�۪s has human moments. They�۪re almost out of place; subtlety is one language this playful film doesn�۪t speak."

lovers and each other�۪s mirror during the Bosnian war. The movie opens in 1992 right before the fighting started and soon after Ajla (Zana Marjanovic) an artist and a Muslim goes on a date with Danijel (Goran Kostic) a cop and a Bosnian Serb. Recently acquainted the two meet up at a club where they fall into each other�۪s arms dance and flirt nestled in an exuberant raucous humanity a communion that abruptly ends when a bomb detonates inside the club. The old world falls away and in its place there is dust blood and Ajla and Danijel staggering toward their newly divided worlds." Angelina Jolie sets its terms ruthlessly. Ajla along with several dozen other Muslim women is grabbed by Serbian soldiers and put on a bus. It�۪s a short hellish ride ��� from the bus one of the soldiers guns down a passerby as casually as if he were skeet shooting ��� that ends when the convoy arrives at a military base. The women are lined up and stripped of their possessions and a soldier asks if any can cook. A few nervously raise their hands making anxious bargains for their lives. One woman says she�۪s a doctor while another says she can sew. The soldier asks the second woman about her sexual abilities instead and then grabs her and rapes her in front of the others." in one obvious respect something of a didactic illustration of rape as an instrument of war but it�۪s also undeniably and rightly disturbing. It rattles the movie and you along with it and it also introduces the idea that war is very much about the violent domination of women and not just about nation-states ethnic conflicts historical grudges and men killing men. Ms. Jolie literalizes this theme by bringing Ajla and Danijel together again at the military camp where he is a commander. He sees her shortly after the other woman is raped saving Ajla from being similarly assaulted a decision that has the quality of a moral choice but may in fact be purely mercenary." Danijel takes Ajla as his lover. He saves her but doesn�۪t shield her entirely from the terrors of imprisonment. Time slips away amid small cruelties brutal assaults and a harrowing passage in which the soldiers use the women as shields during a raid on a Muslim enclave. In this scene with her cinematographer Dean Semler Ms. Jolie manages the tricky feat of creating a chaotically violent vision in which the focus remains intently on those who in many war movies are often an afterthought: the women." at times almost proselytizing aspect to the story that seems of a piece with her laudable humanitarian work. That�۪s especially true in the scenes in which Ms. Jolie switches into full-on expository mode putting dry plodding words into the characters�۪ mouths that would work better in the kind of on-screen textual explanations with their snippets of history and politics that open and close the movie. When for instance in an early scene Danijel�۪s father a Serbian general (Rade Serbedzija) instructs his son on military matters he also provides a short history lesson on the region that�۪s clearly meant for the benefit of those watching the movie." though it moves briskly and easily holds your attention largely through a perverse love story that doesn�۪t suffer for being such an obvious metaphor for the larger battle raging beyond Ajla and Danijel�۪s relationship. Both Ms. Marjanovic and Mr. Kostic are very fine (like the rest of the cast they deliver their dialogue in Bosnian) and they navigate the contradictions of their characters�۪ feelings the flashes of hate the surrender to desire with delicacy. There�۪s madness in this relationship. But as the glimpses of the outside world show particularly in some tough scenes involving Ajla�۪s sister Lejla (Vanesa Glodjo) there is madness everywhere." including rape."

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/movies/the-adventures-of-tintin-by-steven-spielberg-review.html
Tintin circled the globe in the name of European divertissement. The pen-and-ink creation of the Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi (1907-83) known better as Herg̩ Tintin is the charming boy reporter and adventurer who with his white fox terrier Snowy close at heel has traveled the world since 1929 in action-packed yarns with titles like ���Cigars of the Pharaoh.�۝ It was only a matter of time before Tintin went Hollywood. And yowza has he hit it big and hard in ���The Adventures of Tintin �۝ a marvel of gee-wizardry and a night�۪s entertainment that can feel like a lifetime." including pluck ingenuity derring-do exotic locales and a ready-made team of friends and foes. Many of these are busily at play in ���The Adventures of Tintin �۝ an animated boy�۪s own adventure directed by Steven Spielberg that eternal Hollywood boy wonder. Almost wholly cooked up in a computer and using motion-capture technology it turns on a riddle that takes the story from sea to desert and other landlubbing destinations including an imaginary Moroccan city Bagghar (a play on a French word for brawl bagarre) which looks as canned as a sand-strewn set for a Bob Hope and Bing Crosby road movie if tidier and pricier." Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish ���The Adventures of Tintin�۝ is stitched together from three Herg̩ books including ���The Secret of the Unicorn.�۝ It begins promisingly enough when Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) spots a model of a ship the Unicorn in a market. Taken with its painstaking detail ��� a nice metaphor for this precisely wrought vaguely 1940s world ��� he buys the model though his purchase is challenged by a mustachioed American detective Barnaby (Joe Starr) and a meddler of ominous provenance Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig) whose name is a reminder that Tintin�۪s inaugural comic pitted him against the Bolsheviks. (���I think the dirty little bourgeois is asleep �۝ a Bolshevik agent says in ���Tintin in the Land of the Soviets �۝ before failing to blow him up.)" in which he finds the riddle that sets him and Snowy off on a series of zippily choreographed chases that first take them from their home in Brussels to a freighter where they meet Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) a blustering boozer who�۪s more amusing on the page than onscreen. Haddock one of Tintin�۪s frequent comrades in adventure holds the secret to the mystery though he�۪s initially too loaded to know it. (Tintin may tsk-tsk Haddock�۪s sousing ways but the movie takes a blithely amused view of drunkenness.) It�۪s only later when Haddock dries up while lost and hallucinating in a desert ��� in a wonderful sequence in which crested sand dunes melt into peaking ocean waves and back again ��� does he offer relief beyond the comic." which he has described as ���Indiana Jones for kids�۝ (a redundant notion). The most involved chase sequence in the movie finds Tintin and company creatively racing through and laying waste to Bagghar much as Indy does to a stretch of Cairo in ���Raiders of the Lost Ark.�۝ In contrast to ���Raiders �۝ which sees Indy shooting a sword-wielding opponent in a jokey illustration of Western imperialist might Tintin�۪s adventures here feel willfully guileless: colonialism may haunt Tintin�۪s world as imagined by Herg̩ but it doesn�۪t trouble this one. Tintin is racing after the riddle of the Unicorn but mostly he�۪s chasing mystery for mystery�۪s sake a search that ��� once he bonds with Haddock ��� transforms into a more personally redemptive quest." but that kind of honey trap would bring Eros into the equation thereby endangering the childlike innocence ( really a convenient na��vet̩) that defines Tintin a character who�۪s as resolutely neutered as his dog presumably is. So instead the story trots out a sole distaff representative in the ludicrous form of Bianca Castafiore (Kim Stengel) a dowager diva with a barrel build and a glass-shattering voice. One high note later and the scene has gone kablooey setting off another round of Rube Goldberg-like calamities that keep Tintin hopping and running and jumping and driving and chasing ��� as the virtual cameras swoop and dip ��� like a Tom and Jerry cartoon on repeat." but there�۪s nothing he can do with the way the character looks. Neither fully human nor fully animated Mr. Spielberg�۪s Tintin resembles Herg̩�۪s creation yet is eerily different as if like Pinocchio�۪s his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted. This Tintin is lifelike but without the pulse of real life. The problem is that Mr. Spielberg has erred on the side of verisimilitude with a technology ��� in which an actor�۪s movements and facial gestures are transmitted via electrodes to a computer ��� that because it�۪s a simulacrum of life still works better for otherworldly creatures like the blue Pandorans in ���Avatar�۝ or broad caricatures like Tintin�۪s bubbling allies the detective duo Thompson and Thomson (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost)." elegant style known as clear line Herg̩�۪s Tintin has a spherical head a stub nose and black ovals for eyes. His half-circle brows sit on his face like accent marks and with his red-smudged cheeks and beads of sweat that invariably pop off his head give Tintin surprising expressivity." one readers can slip on as they rush through the story or leisurely turn the page. And it�۪s a face that along with Tintin�۪s asexuality and lack of a family makes him into a marvelous blank an avatar for armchair adventurers." the movie proves less than inviting because it�۪s been so wildly overworked: there is hardly a moment of downtime a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes. Relax you think as Tintin and the story rush off again as if Mr. Spielberg were afraid of losing us with European-style longueurs. Bore us? He�۪s Steven Spielberg! This lack of modulation grows tedious which is too bad because as always with him there are interludes of cinematic delight when his visual imagination (like the transition in which Tintin and Haddock seem to appear in a puddle someone steps in) and his Spielbergian playfulness get the better of his insistence on bludgeoning us with technique."

it seems every senseless waste of life gets its own gauzy tear-jerker. That�۪s about the only way to justify ���The Flowers of War �۝ in which the veteran Chinese director Zhang Yimou revisits the Nanjing massacre of 1937 by making something resembling a backstage musical with breaks for the occasional ghastly murder or rape." ���The Flowers of War�۝ is sunk by the disproportion between the events being portrayed and Mr. Zhang�۪s distanced strangely frivolous treatment of them ��� in essence his refusal to take a point of view on one of the most gruesome chapters in Chinese history." state-approved and Oscar-submitted buzz that got louder last week when the film�۪s British star Christian Bale was forcibly prevented from visiting a Chinese activist lawyer being held under house arrest." patriotic approach to the Japanese invasion and occupation of Nanjing (formerly Nanking) while not entirely unfounded are misplaced. Other recent Chinese films have displayed more sentimental nationalism jingoism and demonization of the Japanese enemy." Hollywood-inspired melodrama that has made him an art-house favorite. In the process he fails to deliver on most of the elements ��� grandeur historical sweep genuine pathos ��� that would have made the film worthwhile." as in ���Raise the Red Lantern�۝ or ���House of the Flying Daggers �۝ Mr. Zhang�۪s almost clinical attention to pretty surfaces and soap-opera mechanics can have entertaining results. In ���Flowers �۝ though you can feel him at war with his material never settling on a tone or a compelling or even coherent narrative. (The screenplay is by Liu Heng and Geling Yan based on a novel by Ms. Yan.)" back-lot atmosphere; the opening scenes set in the streets take place in an actual fog of war with smoke (and at one point the dust from a large mound of flour) isolating the characters from the real world of Nanjing." a disreputable American vagabond who happens to be a mortician; as the film begins he is making his way through the fighting toward the church where he is to be paid to conduct a burial. Also on the move are two groups of a dozen or so young women the flowers of the title. They are as a matter of production design if not credible history visually coded: convent students in severe blue jackets and prostitutes in seductive rainbow-hued silken dresses." with Miller who dons the robes of a dead priest bridging the Manichaean divide between the suspicious students upstairs and the contemptuous defensive prostitutes hiding in the basement. (They quickly transform their cellar into a seraglio; you can practically smell the perfume.) It�۪s a contrived hothouse state of affairs summed up in a scene Mr. Zhang likes so much that he repeats it: the laughing prostitutes sashaying across the churchyard in slow motion oblivious to the impending tragedy." of course though when it comes it takes a weirdly oblique form. One group eventually performs what appears to be an ultimate sacrifice full of sexual and social overtones but this happens off-camera if it happens at all. The coyness can be explained perhaps in terms of the film�۪s structure ��� the story is narrated by one of the students and what we see may correspond to her selective romanticized memories ��� but it cannot really be excused." meanwhile the camera ventures into the outside world in occasional scenes that seem timed to goose the action and remind us that we�۪re watching a war movie. In one of Mr. Zhang�۪s few outright concessions to the notion of Chinese supremacism a lone officer (Tong Dawai) draws a contingent of Japanese soldiers away from the church in an act of hyperbolic heroism. Later in a surrender to gross sentimentality two prostitutes leave the church on the sort of insane mercy mission that happens only in movies with particularly disturbing consequences. Aside from that sequence Mr. Zhang is restrained in his depictions of Japanese brutality which mostly take the form of threats and intimidation." turning in a respectable if oddly chipper performance under the circumstances has the unfortunate task of playing a character who doesn�۪t really add up. Miller�۪s conversion from opportunist to savior may be another stock element of this sort of movie but the scene meant to showcase his transformation is rushed and ineffective. Having made an American the central figure in his film Mr. Zhang reduces him to wrangling flocks of nubile women like Cary Grant in a much more violent ���Father Goose.�۝" less hyped movies about the Nanjing massacre including the harrowing drama ���City of Life and Death �۝ directed by Lu Chuan and the documentary ���Nanking �۝ by Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturman.

One of Albert�۪s co-workers describes him less kindly as a ���freak �۝ and there is certainly something odd about this elfin diffident ginger-haired fellow who attends to his duties with fastidious care. He is not indeed a fellow at all but a woman who has lived most of her life disguised as a man. And not just any woman: this self-effacing cautious character whose name is also the title of Rodrigo Garcia�۪s lively and touching new film is played by the dazzling and infinitely resourceful Glenn Close." whose practice is to hover half-invisibly at the edges of things inscrutably observing the boisterous doings of the rest of humanity. Rather she imparts a mysterious glow to his smallest gestures and actions balancing nimbly on the line between comedy and pathos. On the streets of Dublin wearing a bowler hat and a dark coat wielding a rolled-up umbrella Albert is a Chaplinesque figure. He walks stiffly and speaks in a low monotone acting out a parody of masculinity that is charming revealing and sad." a humming establishment run by Mrs. Baker a shrewd and pretentious lady played with cooing squawking relish by Pauline Collins.

It turns out that Hubert (Janet McTeer) is also a woman in disguise and he becomes Albert�۪s mentor and model. Both of them decided to live as men to escape male violence but they inhabit their assumed identities in very different ways. For Albert maleness is a way of disappearing in public a protective cloak of anonymity that guarantees safety. For Hubert being a man is a form of self-assertion. Tall and loose-limbed a smoker and a talker Hubert is happy to partake of the privileges of his adopted gender including the company of a lovely and devoted wife (Bronagh Gallagher)." or after?�۝ Albert wonders about this arrangement believing mistakenly that it is more of a business deal than a romantic bond. His pursuit of Helen follows along this cautious practical track: He is saving his tips and wages in the hopes of opening a tobacco shop and he imagines that a wife could supply him with labor and legitimacy as well as company." and ���Albert Nobbs�۝ explores the complications with a light and sensitive touch. Ms. McTeer�۪s sly exuberant performance is a pure delight and the counterpoint between her physical expressiveness and Ms. Close�۪s tightly coiled reserve is a marvel to behold. The rest of the film is a bit too decorous and tidy to count as a major revelation but it dispenses satisfying doses of humor pathos and surprise." who played Albert Nobbs on stage in New York almost 30 years ago has been trying for many years to bring his story to the screen. She found an ideal director in Mr. Garcia notable for his sympathetic view of women ��� as seen in ���Nine Lives�۝ and ���Mother and Child�۝ ��� and his ability to keep melodrama within the bounds of good taste. This last quality may count as a limitation because it is possible to imagine a wilder campier more radical rendering of ���Albert Nobbs.�۝ (The Pedro Almod�_var version for example might be interesting)." sober careful version we have is good enough and it is in keeping with the way Ms. Close interprets the character as a person for whom tact formality and decency represent not the denial of feeling but its most profound and authentic expression." more implied than shown."

And Ms. Mara captures her volatile and fascinating essence beautifully. Hurt fury and calculation play on her pierced and shadowed face.

Despite the slick intensity of Mr. Fincher�۪s style his movie is not immune to the same lumbering proceduralism. There are waves of brilliantly orchestrated anxiety and confusion but also long stretches of drab hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere. We might be watching ���Cold Case�۝ or ���Criminal Minds �۝ but with better sound design and more expressive visual techniques. Hold your breath it�۪s a time for a high-speed Internet search! Listen closely because the chief bad guy is about to explain everything right before he kills you!"

And everywhere she and Mikael turn there are more bullying unprincipled and abusive men." �۝ and Mr. Fincher approaches it with queasy teasing sensationalism.

This disparity is perfectly conventional ��� the exploitation of female nudity is an axiom of modern cinema ��� but it also represents a failure of nerve and a betrayal of the sexual egalitarianism Lisbeth Salander argues for and represents." it is her movie and Ms. Mara�۪s. Mr. Craig is an obliging sidekick and the other supporting actors (notably Robin Wright as Mikael�۪s colleague and paramour and Donald Sumpter as a helpful detective) perform with professionalism and conviction.

There has been a playground altercation between two young boys and a hamster has been removed from a comfortable high-rise apartment and abandoned to its fate on the streets of Brooklyn." by the way with million-dollar views and most likely an even higher appraised value ��� you might conclude that the poor animal has actually been liberated. The four human characters in the play seem in contrast unable to escape. They are two married couples the parents of those schoolboys who are meeting to figure out what to do about the unfortunate incident involving their sons. The Longstreets (Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly) whose child Zachary was injured are the hosts. On several occasions their visitors the Cowans (Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet) make ready to leave getting as far as the elevators before being drawn back into the Longstreets�۪ living room as if compelled by a sorcerer�۪s curse or an unseen chthonic force." the title of Ms. Reza�۪s play when it came to Broadway in 2009 by way of Paris. The glib alluring notion that spins through 80 minutes of contentious dialogue is that beneath the surface of civilized behavior lurks an unquenchable animal impulse a principle of aggression we labor in vain to suppress. As the Cowans and the Longstreets go through the motions of mature reasonable conflict resolution that old primal force asserts itself in various forms. These nice complacent people turn angry competitive contemptuous and stupid. The spectator gliding and feinting around the edges of the room with Mr. Polanski�۪s nimble camera anticipates violence and perhaps hopes for it to erupt." a high-strung high-minded avatar of liberal hypocrisy Ms. Foster is frighteningly intense and her skirmishes with Alan Cowan Mr. Waltz�۪s cynical corporate lawyer are full of vigor and venom. But the characters never quite rise above New Yorker-cartoon-style caricature. The smug big shot with his suit and his cellphone. The smug do-gooder with her fancy recipes and her African art." just locating a soft spot in Ms. Reza�۪s text ��� Alan and Penelope are representatives of a social type that is meant to be at once global and local. They belong to a cosmopolitan urban upper middle class that flourishes in the cities of the developed world. But satire requires a bit more specificity and as a portrait of anxious status-conscious Brooklyn parents living in a chiaroscuro of self-righteousness and guilt ���Carnage�۝ misses its mark badly." the sister of a Zachary would much more plausibly be a Sophie or an Emma than a Courtney. (Courtney? What is this Beverly Hills? Reality television? Come on!) The elder Cowans and Longstreets would be on a first-name basis from the start so that the ���call me Penelope �۝ ���call me Alan�۝ moment would never occur. (In France an invitation to replace the formal vous with the familiar tu might well be part of an encounter like this one but this is not France.) And someone with Penelope Longstreet�۪s political views and multicultural concerns would be most unlikely to proclaim herself without irony a defender of ���Western values.�۝" but ���Carnage�۝ is partly about the narcissism of small differences ��� the nuances of rank taste and behavior that take on disproportionate importance in close quarters ��� and fudged or sloppy details expose a larger weakness of design. Like Ms. Reza�۪s ���Art�۝ this play consists of a superficially provocative idea slapped onto an almost-probable situation and whipped into a froth of hyper-articulate nonsense." since ���Carnage�۝ is formally at least a study in claustrophobia. Confinement is Mr. Polanski�۪s signature. This is not the first time he has observed with morbid and mischievous fascination the behavior of people in apartments ��� there was Catherine Deneuve in ���Repulsion �۝ Mia Farrow in ���Rosemary�۪s Baby �۝ Adrien Brody in ���The Pianist�۝ ��� and here he proves himself once again to be a virtuoso of entrapment." flat dimensions of the screen the director destroys it. In the theater the audience and the actors occupy the same space which in this case means that the spectators are complicit in the ritual scourging taking place onstage. Theatrical space is already a world unto itself. But in Mr. Polanski�۪s film we are continually literally aware of the world beyond the Longstreets�۪ apartment which is visible through their windows. And this knowledge makes their bickering and posturing seem both unreal and trivial." �۝ in any case should not really be a movie. It should be a parlor game. My colleague Dwight Garner has already proposed a simple version consisting of a four-person reading of the play around a table which sounds like more fun than watching Mr. Polanski�۪s film. But the idea could be refined further into a brutal amalgam of Twister charades and contract bridge. We�۪ll need a dish of cold cobbler a bottle of good Scotch a cellphone repressed hostility and vaguely liberal attitudes. Let�۪s play! I�۪ll be the hamster."

The fourth in the franchise this ���Mission�۝ has a solid cast including a notable new co-star in Jeremy Renner; a new director Brad Bird; and a story that�۪s as nonsensical as any in the series. Mostly though it has Mr. Cruise hurtling through the movie as if his life depended on it which to judge by the hard line of his jaw his punishingly fit body and the will etched into his every movement may be what�۪s at stake." the director of the Pixar movies ���The Incredibles�۝ and ���Ratatouille �۝ has taken over the reins of the franchise for his live-action directing debut. The ���Mission: Impossible�۝ movies belong to that outlandish sometimes cartoonish class of action adventures in which lesser Bond-like heroes walk or race from fiery explosions in between locking and loading kissing and killing and killing some more. The films spun off the 1960s television show fondly remembered for its rubber masks and Lalo Schifrin�۪s brilliant pulsating theme music added Mr. Cruise who in the 15 years since the first installment has tumbled from his top spot as the world�۪s biggest movie star to lag behind neo-action figures like Leonardo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp." yet he�۪s scarcely out. That�۪s partly because of Mr. Bird who has given this movie a self-aware levity that�۪s intended to clear away the bummer blues of the last ���Mission �۝ five years ago. Directed by J. J. Abrams who is also a producer of this movie the third film skewed the series too dark with a nihilistic baddie (chilled to shivering by Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a nightmarish torture scene. It also burdened Mr. Cruise�۪s character Ethan Hunt with a wife (Michelle Monaghan) an unwise move ��� American action heroes latter-day fantasies of our native rugged individualism walk alone not down the aisle ��� which suggested that the soon-to-be-remarried Mr. Cruise was borrowing a chapter from his own life." written by Josh Appelbaum and Andr̩ Nemec both alumni of Mr. Abrams�۪s television show ���Alias�۝ (mostly) ditches the wife and gets back to action basics with globe-trotting nifty gadgets high-flying stunts and less loquacious villainy (Michael Nyqvist). (It was also partly shot in Imax which doesn�۪t really enhance anything.)" after being broken out of a Moscow prison where he had been idling among hordes of bull-necked Ivans and Igors sets off on another mission with an old teammate the tech whiz Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and the obligatory pretty lady Agent Jane Carter (Paula Patton). The mission goes bust and boom as does a debriefing with Ethan�۪s boss (Tom Wilkinson uncredited) whose murder finds Ethan and his team blackballed (if still sleuthing) and keeping company with an intelligence analyst William Brandt (Mr. Renner)." who played the main bomb specialist in ���The Hurt Locker �۝ eases effortlessly into the blockbuster register where star charisma and presence like Mr. Cruise�۪s matter more than emotionally selling a scene. Mr. Renner has to do some actual acting because of the role (surprise: there�۪s more to Brandt than a suit) and his low-key performance is a dividend in a movie in which almost all human interactions take exaggerated form with more throttling than talking or so it seems. Mr. Renner isn�۪t an obvious action type ��� he�۪s good-looking rather than roguish or boyishly pretty ��� but as soon as he rolls up his sleeves and picks up a gun it�۪s obvious that he�۪s qualified for the job." Mr. Cruise seems comfortable resuming his franchise duties though there�۪s a palpable difference in his affect even from the last movie. He still radiates intensity bordering on mania but without the familiar ���what me worry?�۝ air of invincibility. Maybe it�۪s age: he turns 50 next year or perhaps Mr. Bird�۪s approach doesn�۪t sit well with him even if it also fits. The wolfish Cruise smile seems tighter at times reluctant despite Mr. Bird�۪s efforts to lighten the mood with banter (much of it supplied by a chattering Mr. Pegg). Over the years Mr. Cruise a divinely superficial presence in pop fodder like ���Top Gun �۝ has grown progressively heavier weighted down by stardom ambition and the misstep of turning his personal life into a public drama. At times he can feel leaden." though his age and inescapable gravitas work for ���Ghost Protocol �۝ partly because they invest the outrageous stunts with a real sense of risk. Mr. Cruise�۪s primary job in the ���Mission�۝ series is to embody a not-quite-ordinary man whose powers are at once extraordinary and completely believable a no-sweat feat in the first few films." however when Ethan ziplines off a building onto a truck and then rolls hard onto the street Mr. Bird ��� while borrowing more than a little from the ���Roadrunner�۝ cartoons ��� also makes you aware of the fragility of the body ricocheting on screen absorbing every blow for your entertainment. And when Mr. Cruise hangs off the even taller building what you see isn�۪t just a man doing a crazy stunt but also one poignantly denying his own mortality." if at times extreme violence including gunplay and a fatal push from a skyscraper.

�۝ Martin Scorsese laments that young people these days are unaware of Roger Corman�۪s work and influence. Mr. Scorsese�۪s complaint is apt and also kind of funny since usually when people bemoan the cultural ignorance of the young they mean that the kids aren�۪t reading great literature or listening to classical music. Rarely will anyone express concern that our youth is insufficiently acquainted with ���Caged Heat �۝ ���The Cry Baby Killer�۝ or ���Monster From the Ocean Floor.�۝" a self-made mogul a prodigious nurturer of talent ��� whose importance to modern American popular culture can hardly be overstated.

A capable craftsman and a crafty businessman Mr. Corman possesses an understanding of movies and their audiences that is both sane and sophisticated a combination that is exceedingly rare in Hollywood." long before anyone else in the film industry the emergence of youth culture in the �۪60s and �۪70s. He started out making cheap monster movies and then after a series of bloody and campily brilliant adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories gravitated toward motorcycles fast cars drugs and sex. Not necessarily in his own life: In person he is always genteel and soft-spoken to the point of squareness with the good manners and slightly distracted air of a Presbyterian minister on his way to a church supper. But his movies are marvels of wildness and as the old studio system fell apart they paved the way for the New Hollywood." though Mr. Corman�۪s ���Wild Angels�۝ was a forerunner of ���Easy Rider �۝ much as ���The Trip�۝ anticipated many future cinematic freakouts. The roster of Mr. Corman�۪s prot̩g̩s includes much of the current American movie establishment. He cast Jack Nicholson in films when nobody else would and gave Mr. Scorsese Jonathan Demme Ron Howard and Peter Bogdanovich early and decisive cracks at directing." �۝ as do many actors writers and directors who owe their careers in some measure to him. While he rarely passed up a chance for on screen gratuitous nudity (at least once the new ratings system allowed it) his universe was never a boys�۪ club and his egalitarian anti-authoritarian disposition makes a lot of Hollywood liberalism look puffed up and hypocritical." in a moment that is a gift to Ms. Stapleton from the documentary gods ��� though not uncritically. His exasperating qualities are recalled chief among them his legendary miserliness. But that was also his great virtue." in the wake of ���Star Wars�۝ and the Corman-esque ���Jaws �۝ a new era of blockbusters was dawning in which lavishly budgeted spectacles crowded out lowbrow low-budget drive-in and grindhouse fare. We live now in an era of pretentious comic-book franchises and $200 million action throwaways bloated entertainments that might appear to represent the triumph of Mr. Corman�۪s vision but are in fact the antithesis of his thrifty honest aesthetic." but the picture that emerges in this documentary is of a decent loyal and sensible man who has spent his life making marvelous trash and sowing the seeds of art."

Tailor Soldier Spy �۝ a superb new adaptation of the 1974 spy novel by John le Carr̩. It�۪s a deep pulse that maintains its insistent rhythm throughout the film�۪s murmured conversations life-and-death office intrigues violence and yearning loves. The throbbing does a number on your nervous system ��� this is a movie you watch on high alert ��� and brings you into the state of mind that can feel like a state of siege and goes by the name of British secret service or just the Circus. For those inside the intelligence service like George Smiley played with delicacy and understated power by Gary Oldman knowledge is power but so too is fear." skillfully mined from Mr. le Carr̩�۪s labyrinthine book and set in 1973 is a pleasurably sly and involving puzzler ��� a mystery about mysteries within mysteries. The head of the service known as Control (John Hurt) believes that there�۪s a Soviet agent a mole among the agency�۪s elite. His main suspects include his closest aide Smiley along with Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) Toby Esterhase (David Dencik) Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) and Bill Haydon (Colin Firth). To find the mole Control secretly sends Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) who runs the agency�۪s scalp hunters (field agents with dirty sometimes bloodied hands) to Hungary to retrieve information. But Prideaux in an agonizing botch-up is shot and Control already politically weak is fired along with Smiley." ���Tinker Tailor�۝ is set against a geopolitical (and movie) moment that is almost quaintly reassuringly old-fashioned a time when enemy agents had names like Boris and a red flag with a hammer and sickle made the ideological and political stakes clear. It�۪s a world of secrets and lies shadows and light illusions and sordid truths loyalties and perverse betrayals (it could be called ���Enemies a Love Story�۝) that the director Tomas Alfredson conjures up in the film�۪s uneasy opening in Control�۪s apartment a cluttered warren fogged over by cigarette smoke. ���There�۪s a rotten apple �۝ Control says to Prideaux drawing on a cigarette as he explains his theory about the mole the folds in Mr. Hurt�۪s magnificent face sagging a bit lower." a crevassed landscape that suggests sorrow and history has the granitic grandeur of W. H. Auden in his later life. In tandem with Mr. Hurt�۪s sonorously melancholic voice (and its useful undertones of hysteria) it is a face that when used by a filmmaker like Mr. Alfredson speaks volumes about a character who would otherwise take reams of written dialogue to discover. But unlike the 1979 British television version with Alec Guinness that ran a dutiful 350 minutes Mr. Alfredson doesn�۪t enjoy the luxury of literalness. Instead working from Bridget O�۪Connor and Peter Straughan�۪s intelligent script this terrifically talented director (���Let the Right One In�۝) distills the novel�۪s essence finding images as with the Circus�۪s chessboardlike walls that express what the film�۪s words and characters don�۪t." who doesn�۪t say a word until 18 minutes in (���I�۪m retired�۝) re-enters the spy game at the behest of a government minister Oliver Lacon (Simon McBurney). Lacon has received alarming information from Ricki Tarr (Tom Hardy) another scalp hunter who has met a Soviet woman Irina (Svetlana Khodchenkova) with apparent knowledge of the mole. Using Tarr�۪s lead and with the help of a trusted Circus agent Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) Smiley begins ferreting out the mole spying on the spies. He also uncovers an operation called Witchcraft and runs up against an arch-villain Karla a Soviet intelligence officer in an almost ruthlessly unromantic vision of empire dreams that unfolds in sad grubby rooms where the flowered wallpaper is sometimes splashed with blood." ���Tinker Tailor�۝ is suffused with longing and love ��� for a country a cause a lover a father ��� a theme that poignantly surfaces at a boys�۪ school where Prideaux re-emerges and which in its cloistered quality mirrors both the big boys�۪ club that is the Circus and recalls another school that haunts the narrative. ���Tinker Tailor�۝ is partly based on the case of Kim Philby one of a handful of British spies and Cambridge University alumni who were recruited by the Soviets in the 1930s. (Mr. le Carr̩ born David John Moore Cornwell was a British spy whose cover was blown by Philby.) At the school Prideaux meets a lonely student Bill Roach (William Haddock) a moon-faced outsider whom Prideaux calls ���a good watcher �۝ a description that given the sadness that cloaks the story�۪s many watchers feels chilling." of course is Smiley the anti-Bond described by Mr. le Carr̩ in ���Tinker Tailor�۝ as looking like ���one of London�۪s meek who do not inherit the earth.�۝ Since the 1979 mini-series the character has been synonymous with Guinness�۪s performance as Mr. le Carr̩ has acknowledged. (Guinness resumed the role in the 1982 mini-series ���Smiley�۪s People.�۝) Mr. Oldman now mostly known for his small sharp turns in big movies playing Harry Potter�۪s godfather Sirius Black and James Gordon in the Batman movies wisely doesn�۪t reinvent Smiley. Rather ��� as hinted in an early scene of Smiley buying the kind of oversize eyeglasses that Guinness wore ��� he and Mr. Alfredson have opted to build on the original interpretation using it as a foundational text. (Guinness�۪s turn is the Torah; Mr. Oldman�۪s the Talmud.)" dominating it with shouts and displays of obvious technique as take it over incrementally an occupation that echoes Smiley�۪s steady incursion into the mole�۪s lair. Again and again as he does with the other watchers Mr. Alfredson places Smiley on one side of a window looking out at a world that he both belongs to and remains very much outside of. There�۪s a sense throughout that Smiley preoccupied with thoughts of his errant faithless wife Ann (Katrina Vasilieva never viewed in full) doesn�۪t just live in a place apart but also in a kind of dream. Yet like the old Circus ��� a lost world seen in the intermittent flashbacks to a holiday party that when pieced together reveal so much including who loved whom and who was betrayed ��� Ann is an illusion that Smiley fights for."

���Young Adult�۝ shrouds its brilliant brave and breathtakingly cynical heart in the superficial blandness of commercial comedy. More radically than ���J. Edgar�۝ or even ���Greenberg �۝ this movie written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman challenges the dreary conventional wisdom that a movie protagonist must be likable. Along the way it systematically demolishes a china shop full of shopworn sentimental touchstones about ��� for starters ��� high school small-town life heterosexuality Minnesota and the capacity of human beings to change learn and grow." Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) seems to have grown though perhaps not in the most constructive ways. Crossing the treacherous unmarked boundary between her mid- and late-30s Mavis has acquired some of the trappings and habits of adulthood. She lives in a spacious slightly sterile high-rise apartment in Minneapolis (a Midwestern variant on the den of Manhattan anomie that Michael Fassbender�۪s sex-addled character inhabits in ���Shame�۝) and has for company a fuzzy little dog and a big flat-screen television permanently tuned to some Kardashian or another." though not much about the marriage that preceded it. Mavis supports herself by writing installments in a popular series of ���Gossip Girl�۝-like novels for teenagers and though her name does not appear on the cover she derives some creative and professional satisfaction from the job. She drinks a lot pulls at her hair and seems generally unconcerned with other people. She is pretty poised and imperious in the way that can come naturally to tall beautiful blond women but also weary and blue ��� a platinum princess suffering from metal fatigue." Mavis decides to go back to her hometown Mercury Minn. and reconnect with her high school boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson). Just how spectacularly bad this idea is ��� how packed with vanity magical thinking and plain stupid meanness ��� emerges over the course of a few days but the warning signs are there from the start." who is married has just become a father for the first time. To Mavis this can mean only that he is trapped in a domestic prison from which she must rescue him. And so she arrives in Mercury intent on breaking up his marriage a plan she justifies to herself in the romantic language of destiny soul mates and following your heart." both the kind Mavis writes and the genre she appears at first glance to inhabit. With sly understatement Ms. Cody and Mr. Reitman (who previously collaborated on ���Juno�۝) allow a set of comfortable expectations to emerge. We all know ��� from bad movies like ���Cars �۝ say ��� that a big-city big shot on a visit to a small town will be constructively humbled by the simple honest folks who live there. (Or else as in ���Straw Dogs �۝ terrorized by them). We are also conditioned to believe all kinds of contradictory claptrap about adolescence which we are supposed to leave behind but also hold onto for (if I may show my own age by paraphrasing John Mellencamp) as long as we can." the Breeders and ��� of course this being Minnesota ��� the Replacements serve as tokens of belonging and signifiers of nostalgia.

�۝ Lynne Ramsay�۪s disturbing movie about the mother of a child who goes on a killing spree at his high school. That trite phrase is accurate in an almost technical sense: Ms. Ramsay (who adapted Lionel Shriver�۪s novel with Rory Stewart Kinnear) follows a kind of dream logic in telling a chronologically splintered story weaving patterns of associated images and sensations into an intense and claustrophobic web of fear." pitched at the extreme boundary of everyday anxieties. Tilda Swinton who plays the anguished mother is far too specific a screen presence to be an easy audience surrogate. Much of the queasy fascination that the film exerts is the result of her uncanny ability to play against any imaginable type." Eva Khatchadourian is too complicated for pity projecting a mixture of cold poise and extreme vulnerability that makes her predicament especially awful. We watch as she loses everything except her dignity but it is precisely that noble steely pride that places her just beyond the range of a sympathy that she would most likely refuse in any case. Video: An excerpt from a TimesTalks interview with Tilda Swinton" �۝ though it evokes real-life atrocities like the 1999 Columbine school shootings is less a psychological or sociological case study than a horror movie a variant on the bad-seed narrative that feeds on a primal (and seldom acknowledged) fear of children. What if they turn out wrong? What if we can�۪t love them? What if they refuse to love us? These worries are rarely dealt with in the child-rearing manuals but they hover over modern nurseries like the ghosts of ancient fairy-tale curses." a travel writer who once enjoyed a life of free-wheeling Bohemian bliss ��� we catch glimpses of her in ecstasy at religious festivals in India and at ease in picturesque European cities ��� is brought down to earth by pregnancy and motherhood. With her amiable practical husband Franklin (John C. Reilly) she abandons a downtown loft for a house in the suburbs and sacrifices her wanderlust on the altar of responsibility." but little Kevin (played in toddlerhood by Rock Duer and latency by Jasper Newell) has been born with a filial ingratitude sharper than any serpent�۪s tooth. More than that he possesses from infancy an active and demonic hostility toward his mother. His incessant crying when he is in Eva�۪s care comes to seem like the opening salvo in a long campaign to wreck her happiness and destroy her peace of mind." messes up her most precious possessions and quietly sows seeds of discord between Eva and Franklin. The arrival of a younger sister (Ashley Gerasimovich) far from easing the tension in the family only gives Kevin new opportunities to show what a manipulative little sociopath he can be." whose narrow eyes and high cheekbones suggest more a clone of Ms. Swinton than a child she might have had with the soft-featured Mr. Reilly. Mother and son both lean watchful and dark-haired are like a pair of predatory reptiles incongruously housed with the fluffy friendly animals. Their antagonism is its own kind of bond which makes its fulfillment almost incomprehensibly terrible." shunned and abused by the people she had never wanted to live among in the first place ��� and the events that led up to it. Horror movies tend to be relentlessly linear moving in a crescendo of suspense that grows out of our panicked curiosity about what will happen next. Ms. Ramsay with ruthless ingenuity creates a deeper dread and a more acute feeling of anticipation by allowing us to think we know what is coming and then shocking us with the extent of our ignorance." to be sure but also a lot of craft.

a no-frills affair from the first-time Irish director Ian Palmer offers a circumscribed look inside the often-closed world of Irish travelers through their bare-knuckle fistfights. Historically nomads who were once better known as tinkers and described by Yeats as ���the people of the roads �۝ the travelers long lived outside the mainstream but from their on-camera showboating ��� as they duke it out crow about their wins taunt the losers and bang the drums for the next slugfest ��� they�۪re ready for their collective close-up." as he explains in voice-over stumbled on the fights by chance. While he was videotaping the wedding of a traveler Michael Quinn McDonagh Mr. Palmer met Michael�۪s older brother James. A charismatic clan leader James ��� called the Mighty Quinn or Baldy James depending on who�۪s doing the calling ��� turned out to be a champion fighter. Invited to videotape one of James�۪s fights Mr. Palmer grabbed his camera. Thus began a documentary filmmaking odyssey that would last 12 staggering years and after the 2011 Sundance Film Festival found Mr. Palmer on the festival circuit and signed to a deal with HBO which plans to turn ���Knuckle�۝ into a dramatic series. The stars as it were of ���Knuckle�۝ are James Quinn McDonagh and his most vociferous opponent Paddy Joyce a k a the Lurcher a shouter with a handlebar mustache and enough body hair to knit a sweater. Although it was Michael who first gave Mr. Palmer entry into this world it was James who kept the director�۪s attention and probably fueled his commitment. A meaty slab of a man who likes to keep his head shaved ��� perhaps in part because the fights can turn dirty ��� James is his family�۪s best fighter as undefeated as he is unbowed. He�۪s also a good talker (useful subtitles help with the travelers�۪ heavily accented English) even if he doesn�۪t say much including about traveler life beyond the brawling." messy brutal ��� are so involving both appalling and appallingly watchable even in smeariest video. It�۪s always the same: two men with bare knuckles and sagging or ridged bellies square off in a rural corner and smack each other to cheers and jeers of the crowd. It seems depressingly pointless." including tradition pride feuds ��� somewhere in the past a caravan was destroyed and sometime later a man was killed ��� and money. As it turns out the families bet heavily on the fights (the stakes are high) which effectively means that they�۪re helping support themselves by beating their own people bloody." though the mournful string music suggests that he�۪d like you to see the fights in tragic terms. They are in a sense though they�۪re also opportunistic and human. While it�۪s frustrating that Mr. Palmer doesn�۪t dig deep into the complexities of the fights one of the movie�۪s strengths is the honesty with which he confesses his doubts about them. He also expresses reservations about his reasons for following the bouts an admission that both speaks to the motivations of documentary cinema (why film?) and to those who have ever wondered why they can�۪t look away from violence. Year after bruising year Mr. Palmer kept his sights on these grim battles an epic endeavor that suggests that looking away was never an option."

�۝ inspired by the real exploits of a Polish sewer worker and sometime burglar named Leopold Socha who helped Jews during the Nazi occupation of Lvov (now Lviv in Ukraine) provides the latest evidence that the Holocaust movie has become a genre in its own right. Even a true story can follow the familiar conventions of film narrative and this tale of a righteous gentile selflessly assisting in the survival of a handful of persecuted Jews is no exception." horrifying and at times intensely moving. But the ease with which it elicits these responses from the audience feels more opportunistic than insightful. Feature films about the Holocaust are often celebrated for preserving memory and raising awareness of the pervasive horror and occasional heroism of a fast-receding history. But who among the ticket-buyers is likely to be unaware of the broad outlines (and even the terrible particulars) of the Nazi genocide?" but rather to feel: to pity the victims despise the villains and identify with both the vulnerable and the brave. ���In Darkness �۝ which was written by David F.

Early in the film Poldek and his young colleague (and criminal sidekick) Szczepek (Krzysztof Skonieczny) who use the sewer tunnels as escape routes and hiding places for their loot stumble on a nightmarish scene in the forests outside town. What they see ��� a group of naked terrified women being chased and shot by German soldiers ��� serves as a haunting reminder of the fact amply documented in Claude Lanzmann�۪s ���Shoah �۝ that ordinary Poles knew what was happening to their Jewish neighbors." hiding in the shadows amid the waste and vermin. Poldek helps them first as a business proposition ��� they have money to pay him ��� and eventually out of a sense of moral obligation. His ethical awakening provides one of the film�۪s dramatic arcs as like Oskar Schindler in the paradigmatic Righteous-Gentile movie ���Schindler�۪s List �۝ Poldek evolves from self-seeking operator to humanitarian hero. He must overcome the skepticism of his wife the ever-present threat of the Germans and the intrusions of Bortnik (Michal Zurawski) an old prison buddy who now wears the uniform of the Nazi-supporting Ukrainian militia." meanwhile huddle in darkness and enact their own parables of human nature under duress.

In the course of their 14 months in the sewers some will die some will fall in love and a baby will be born ��� all of it rendered in shadowy glimmering half-light by Ms. Holland and the cinematographer Jolanta Dylewska." and it gives ���In Darkness�۝ the dreamlike quality of a fairy tale. Constriction and freedom ��� and the assertion of individual will in cruelly oppressive circumstances ��� are themes Ms. Holland has explored before in ���The Secret Garden �۝ ���Washington Square�۝ and her earlier World War II drama ���Europa Europa.�۝" which are represented above all by the linguistic polyphony of the dialogue. German Yiddish Polish and Ukrainian compete for attention and the languages are markers not only of ethnicity but also of class and ideology." maudlin musical soundtrack ��� provides ���In Darkness�۝ with a kernel of authenticity as does Mr. Wieckiewicz�۪s stoical performance.

it might have looked a little like ���Under Control �۝ a gleamingly intimate tour of German nuclear power plants and the policies that sustain them." but the images unsettle as the camera slides along a glistening fuel rod and pauses transfixed before a winking control panel. Above one squat windowless building clouds engulf the moon like squid ink and the director Volker Sattel (who doubled as the cinematographer) washes the screen with a gray rain of coolant. Workers boast of elaborate safety measures of smoke screens that activate if a suspicious aircraft is headed their way. But we�۪re distracted by a red ���Help!�۝ button on someone�۪s computer and a corporate logo on a conference booth announcing hilariously ���Nukem.�۝" risk management and waste treatment with the same even gaze Mr. Sattel is not above mischievous memory tweaking: no actual ���Silkwood�۝ shower shatters the film�۪s serenity but we do glimpse the cylindrical pods where we can imagine one taking place." ���Under Control�۝ transitions from verdant surroundings to antiseptic interiors with lulling fluidity. Decommissioned and abandoned plants lie like ghosts on the landscape (���Chernobyl broke our backs �۝ a disgruntled worker says) though the rebirth of one of these as an amusement park barely removes its chill. Somehow the happy screams of children whirling above a neutered reactor sound a lot less comforting than they should."

it�۪s also the time of the year when moviegoers who yearn for more action and less talk can be forgiven for thinking that what�۪s missing from the big screen is a good beat down. It could use one: this hasn�۪t been a memorable year for cinematic action aside from a quicksilver move here and there and that gone-in-60-seconds moment in ���Drive�۝ when Ryan Gosling glides a car into park. But now there�۪s ���The Yellow Sea �۝ a rush of a movie from South Korea that slips and slides from horror to humor on rivers of blood and offers the haunting image of a man primitive incarnate beating other men with an enormous gnawed-over meat bone." that bone scene is a shocker in a movie with more than one. When I first saw ���The Yellow Sea�۝ in May at the Cannes Film Festival where it was shown under the bluntly literal title ���The Murderer �۝ the audience burst into applause several times jolted by the choreographed frenzy of the movie�۪s car and foot chases. Those chases are so exciting and the blood is so unnerving that I didn�۪t at first realize that they�۪re in service to a moral tale one in which the struggle between good and evil plays out in often unsettling visual terms: that bone isn�۪t just a convenient weapon but also an emblem of this man-eat-dog man-kill-man world." dead or furiously barking and snapping are a recurrent motif in ���The Yellow Sea �۝ which opens with its hapless central character a taxi driver Gu-nam (Ha Jung-woo subtle and moving) relating a story in voice-over. When he was young Gu-nam says his dog became rabid a killer. The local villagers tried to destroy the animal but it ran off only to return later whereupon it lay down and died. After Gu-nam buried his dog the elders dug it up and devoured the carcass. ���The rabies that vanished has come back �۝ he says. ���It�۪s going around.�۝ On screen a photo of an unsmiling child gives way to the adult Gu-nam losing at mah-jongg a suggestion of generational misery." ���The Yellow Sea�۝ follows Gu-nam as he descends into a nightmare that he helps create. The story takes off in Yanji the capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture a wedge of China that borders North Korea and Russia. Initially Gu-nam an ethnic Korean (or chosun-juk) spends his time losing money at mahjongg driving a cab or passed out in his squalid apartment where a web of broken glass covering a framed wedding photo of him and his wife hints at the tragic misunderstanding that sets the story in fast fast motion. His wife has left to find work in South Korea and Gu-nam bereft angry self-pitying has built up a debt that he seems unlikely to work or gamble his way out of." he lands before a gangster Myun-ga (Kim Yun-seok in a tour de force performance) who will wipe out Gu-nam�۪s debt if he kills a man. Stoop-shouldered and somewhat sleepy Myun-ga doesn�۪t look like much of a danger but menace radiates off him especially because he makes his offer in a dog market." a snapshot of Myun-ga�۪s worldview and perhaps Gu-nam�۪s fate as some dogs wildly lunge at one another straining at their leashes while others sit in cages some presumably awaiting their culinary fate. Don�۪t think too hard about what the men later slurp from their bowls but don�۪t freak out either: the only blood spilled is human." gushing and splattering in a story that combines Grand Guignol levels of sanguineous spectacle with raw realism. Amid all the spray there are double-crosses a clandestine trip to Seoul an undertow of politics a gang boss (Cho Seong-ha) and chases that are as spectacularly choreographed and sometimes as funny as those in a Looney Tunes cartoon." reunited with the cinematographer and editor who worked on his feature debut ���The Chaser �۝ makes this movie�۪s 157 minutes fly with scenes that alternately take their time and compress life histories into a few shots and words. When Gu-nam visits a relative the family�۪s entire story ��� its hopes and crushing defeats ��� is telegraphed by the shabbiness of a room and an old man�۪s one-sentence apology." Gu-nam doesn�۪t explain much. What happened between him and his wife surfaces gradually mostly through flashbacks and bits of conversation while his personality comes into focus through his deeds some of which are seemingly absurd as when he takes a food break from playing amateur assassin stepping out to eat a hot dog on a stick." Mr. Na affirms Gu-nam�۪s humanity showing a man hungry cold and terminally alone even as that humanity seems to drain away because of his bad choices and actions. In ���The Yellow Sea�۝ the kinetic filmmaking viscerally conveys the palpitating fear of the chase and the thrill of escape in a movie that suggests that ��� for all the miles Gu-nam racks up ��� for him there may be no exit." knife and meat-bone violence."

insatiable need. An abundance ��� an overdose ��� of movies and books explores the logic of this condition mostly with respect to drugs or alcohol. ���Shame �۝ the relentless new feature from the British artist turned filmmaker Steve McQueen has a lot in common with films that plumb the toxic romance of the bottle or the needle. The crucial difference is that its protagonist a handsome youngish Manhattanite named Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is hooked on sex." since there are rules conventions and cognitive habits that limit how explicit ��� and how explicitly unpleasant ��� movie sex can be. Watching someone else take a drink or snort a line will not cause intoxication in the viewer but watching other people get naked and squirm around together is a sure-enough turn-on to be the basis of a lucrative industry. How can visual pleasure communicate existential misery? It is a real and interesting challenge and if ���Shame�۝ falls short of meeting it the seriousness of its effort is hard to deny." unattractive shut-in but rather a very good-looking admirably proportioned fellow with nice clothes (when he is in them) decent manners and a well-paying job. Brandon who works at a small high-tech firm and lives in an austere apartment in a Chelsea high-rise seems to be stuck in a sleek downbeat 21st-century version of Shakespeare�۪s Sonnet 129. That poem as incisive an anatomy of erotic compulsion as exists in English begins by evoking ���the expense of spirit in a waste of shame�۝ and cycles through the rages and frustrations of lust before collapsing in exhausted fatalism:" �۝ anchored to the treadmill of Brandon�۪s pathology strips this ancient futile wisdom of its poetry. Mr. McQueen is a tenaciously literal filmmaker mistrusting metaphor and psychological speculation and dwelling on the facts of behavior and bodily experience. His debut feature ���Hunger �۝ in which Mr. Fassbender played Bobby Sands the I.R.A. militant who starved himself to death in a British-administered prison in 1981 was an unflinching look at the corporeal consequences of political zeal. It focused less on the nature of Sands�۪s cause than on the effects on his own person of his commitment to it." a discipline he re-enacts here in circumstances that are only superficially more pleasant. A prisoner of his own needs Brandon ��� to use a curiously apt Victorian phrase ��� abuses himself mercilessly. When he cannot manage a casual encounter he calls an escort service and when that is inconvenient there is always an Internet chat site or the men�۪s room at work where he sneaks off for solitary daytime activity." Sissy (Carey Mulligan) whose neediness is the opposite of Brandon�۪s emotional detachment and whose sloppiness threatens his self-control. Her history of self-abuse apparently includes cutting and possible suicide attempts and her intrusive dependency provokes Brandon to frightening and otherwise uncharacteristically violent displays of temper." these siblings clearly share a self-destructive tendency the sources of which lie somewhere in the background beyond the reach of the film�۪s curiosity. ���We�۪re not bad people �۝ Sissy says in a teary message she leaves on Brandon�۪s cellphone. ���We just come from a bad place �۝ a place specified only as New Jersey." where easy money and relaxed sexual mores combine to produce an atmosphere of general anomie brightened by a few glimmers of comic possibility. In one brilliantly executed early scene Brandon stands by as his boss (James Badge Dale) a boorish would-be ladies�۪ man fails spectacularly to pick up a pretty blonde at a bar. Brandon succeeds without making an overt move or saying very much and Mr. McQueen�۪s deft choreography of eye contact reveals everything we need to know about the workings of desire." but much funnier is a dinner date at which Brandon and Marianne (Nicole Beharie) a co-worker are subjected to the attentions of an aggressively incompetent waiter and also to their own uncertainty about the rules of attraction. But these moments feel less like insights into human interaction than like concessions to an idea of social life that Mr. McQueen does not quite believe in." a Hudson River sunset seen from a high window in the Standard Hotel ��� that serve at once to alleviate the film�۪s harshness and undermine its rigor. And the impulse to explore Brandon�۪s problem in some kind of narrative leaves ���Shame�۝ caught between therapeutic melodrama and melodramatic despair. The climax is for Brandon a chaotic downward slide that blends provocation with a scolding breathless moralism. How far will he go? He�۪ll have sex with a man! With two women!" or of something the filmmakers think he should feel? The movie for all its displays of honesty (which is to say nudity) is also curiously coy. It presents Brandon for our titillation our disapproval and perhaps our envy but denies him access to our sympathy. I know that�۪s the point that Mr. McQueen wants to show how the intensity of Brandon�۪s need shuts him off from real intimacy but this seems to be a foregone conclusion the result of an elegant experiment that was rigged from the start."

�۝ it�۪s clear why he chose this lesser-known Shakespeare tragedy for his directing debut. Dressed in camouflage fatigues Mr. Fiennes ��� as the mythic Roman military hero first known as Caius Martius and later Coriolanus ��� enters a raucous scene and commands it with just a glare. What power! The city�۪s hungry rioting citizens some carrying protest signs and one holding a camera phone have descended demanding food. Martius charges at them and then lets loose the contempt that will aid in his downfall: ���What�۪s the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs?�۝" the rage thunderous and the backdrop ��� war famine civil unrest ��� as familiar as the news. Like John Osborne�۪s 1970s version of the play titled ���A Place Calling Itself Rome�۝ (which Mr. Fiennes gestures at early on) this is Shakespeare�۪s 17th-century tragedy as contemporary military story if one that invokes Iraq and other modern theaters of war. And it works partly because while the language remains Shakespeare�۪s the rule of the mob the political hypocrisies and the grinding of war�۪s engine transcend any age. Then too there�۪s the sheer pleasure of hearing these words spoken by an actor like Mr. Fiennes whose phrasing is so brilliant that you might be tempted to close your eyes if his physical performance weren�۪t equally mesmerizing." by John Logan condenses and dispenses with sections of the original tragedy one of Shakespeare�۪s Roman plays coming in at a tight 122 minutes. At the story�۪s center are two violent twinned relationships the first between Martius and the Roman citizens he despises (they ���like nor peace nor war�۝) the second between Martius and his Volscian enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) whom Martius openly admires: ���I sin in envying his nobility.�۝ Martius protects the citizens who are unlike him and fights the man who is most like him the dangers of his attitude toward each suggested by the calls for his murder that bookend the play. This is part of his tragedy as are the pride and disdain that lead him from the hero�۪s role to the monster�۪s." Martius heads out to fight the Volscians. The possible scent of her son�۪s newly spilled blood sends Martius�۪s patriotic mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) into raptures. Blood she enthuses to Martius�۪s stunned wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) ���more becomes a man than gilt his trophy.�۝" his eyes shining in a face streaked in blood. Having created one brilliant villain with Voldemort in the Harry Potter series Mr. Fiennes his head shaved summons up another by visually evoking the iconography of Marlon Brando�۪s in ���Apocalypse Now.�۝ Later the character puts on a white shirt and suspenders suggesting that the great Roman conqueror is nothing more than a common skinhead." suddenly. After routing the Volscians though failing to kill Aufidius Martius returns to Rome where he is given the title of Coriolanus for his victory at a city he had taken. The honor comes with a price: he�۪s forced to play the people�۪s politician a role for which he�۪s disastrously equipped. Done in by pride and by two scheming tribunes Brutus (James Nesbitt) and Sicinius (Paul Jesson) Coriolanus falls from power despite the advice of his mother and his friend Menenius (Brian Cox). Another she-wolf of Rome Volumnia has kept count of Coriolanus�۪s wounds (she�۪d happily lick them) nurturing his fame. But she�۪s done her job too well. Her son has become a war machine that enraged at Rome now turns against it joining with the Volscians." notably by surrounding himself with a strong secondary cast (the smaller roles are less successfully played) and by hiring the cinematographer Barry Ackroyd. Mr. Ackroyd who shot ���The Hurt Locker �۝ gives ���Coriolanus�۝ a visual density that complements the bright opulence of Martius�۪s mansion yet can pick faces out of the fog of war and the darkest shadows. (The sound mixer Ray Beckett also worked on ���The Hurt Locker �۝ in which Mr. Fiennes had a small role.) Together they bring this world alive closing the centuries-long distance between the writing of the play and this interpretation. The language lives as do the people who are present enough that it�۪s almost a surprise that no one brandishes that timely protest sign ���Occupy Rome.�۝" based on the play by William Shakespeare; director of photography Barry Ackroyd; edited by Nicolas Gaster; music by Ilan Eshkeri; production design by Ricky Eyres; costumes by Bojana Nikitovic; produced by Mr. Fiennes Mr. Logan Gabrielle Tana Julia Taylor-Stanley and Colin Vaines; released by the Weinstein Company.

The film opens at an isolated compound just as a meeting with the organization�۪s different clan bosses and underbosses is breaking up. One boss Ikemoto (Jun Kunimura) while serving time in prison has made a brotherly pact with an outsider Murase (Renji Ishibashi). Warned against this alliance Ikemoto turns to a subordinate clan boss Otomo (Mr. Kitano using his regular acting moniker Beat Takeshi) to deal quietly with Murase a betrayal ��� of Murase of Otomo ��� that lights a fuse that sizzles burns and blows this world to pieces." but he follows his orders with ruthless efficiency. His actions bring the predictable reactions from Murase and the bloodshed begets retaliatory bloodshed which in turn begets further vengeance as one death leads to another or at least a severe beating. Gradually Otomo begins to understand that Ikemoto�۪s betrayal of Murase isn�۪t just a breach of yakuza ethics such as they are but is symptomatic of a rot eating away at the inside of the organization.

Not everything is as elegantly executed including a tiresome would-be comic subplot involving an African diplomat and a clandestine casino that drags the story down badly and comes close to noxious racial stereotype.

when movies were glorious magical and mute? Neither do I. But the passing of the silent era from memory into myth is what ���The Artist �۝ Michel Hazanavicius�۪s dazzling cinematic objet d�۪art is all about. This is not a work of film history but rather a generous touching and slightly daffy expression of unbridled movie love. Though its protagonist mourns the arrival of sound ���The Artist�۝ itself is more interested in celebrating the range and power of a medium that can sparkle swoon and suffer so beautifully that it doesn�۪t really need to have anything to say." space and sound an embrace of the preposterous that is perhaps more reminiscent of the spirit of early French cinema than of the old Hollywood where the action takes place." and the screens were dominated by antic clowns pale heroines and dashing lovers. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin the star of the popular ���OSS 117�۝ series of French spy spoofs also directed by Mr. Hazanavicius) undoubtedly belongs in that last category. With his shiny hair radiant teeth and thin mustache ��� and a surname one vowel short of Valentino ��� George is a quintessential movie star. The public adores him and he is far too gracious an entertainer to contradict them. A carefree narcissist he bounces from the studio lot to the red carpet to the Beverly Hills mansion he shares with his devoted dog and less enchanted wife and co-star (Penelope Ann Miller) secure in the permanence of his glory." blockbuster-fed movie fans who find themselves dragged to and then transported by this minor marvel ��� will anticipate what happens next. George�۪s pride sets up a fall first into a sweet awkward infatuation with an aspiring actress named Peppy Miller (B̩r̩nice Bejo) then into professional ruin brought about by his stubborn refusal to change with the times. Abandoned by his wife and shunned by the studio boss (a wonderfully boisterous John Goodman) with only the dog and his chauffeur (James Cromwell) standing by him the star goes into eclipse. But even when threatened with the torments of obscurity he refuses to speak." �۝ with its exuberant music and bright colors does not so much revisit the old splendor of cinema silence as obliterate its memory much as ���Sunset Boulevard�۝ unlocks a world of ghosts and shadows among the remnants of the faded Hollywood pantheon. ���The Artist �۝ as aggressively entertaining as any musical is measured in its mourning and eclectic in its nostalgia for old movies. There is a bit of music lifted from Bernard Herrmann�۪s ���Vertigo�۝ score a breakfast-table montage inspired by ���Citizen Kane�۝ and a story line that makes ���The Artist �۝ in essence the latest (and also in a way the earliest but surely not the last) remake of ���A Star Is Born.�۝" and Mr. Hazanavicius�۪s skill in replicating some of the visual effects of early cinema is impressive. But he evokes the glamour and strangeness of silent movies without entirely capturing the full range of their power. His film is less a faithful reproduction than a tasteful updating like a reconstituted classic roadster with a GPS device and a hybrid engine." it is a smooth and very exciting ride. If ���The Artist�۝ revels in gimmickry and occasionally oversells its charm it also understands the deep and durable fascination of the art it embraces. Like Martin Scorsese in ���Hugo �۝ another modern-day journey into a dream of the movie past Mr. Hazanavicius knows that the audience�۪s pleasure arises at once from the complex displays of craft in the service of simple direct effects.

�۝ an enchantment from Martin Scorsese is the 3-D children�۪s movie that you might expect from the director of ���Raging Bull�۝ and ���Goodfellas.�۝ It�۪s serious beautiful wise to the absurdity of life and in the embrace of a piercing longing. No one gets clubbed to death but shadows loom and a ferocious Doberman nearly lands in your lap. The movie is based on the book ���The Invention of Hugo Cabret �۝ but is also very much an expression of the filmmaker�۪s movie love. Surely the name of its author Brian Selznick caught his eye: Mr. Selznick is related to David O. Selznick the producer of ���Gone With the Wind�۝ ��� kismet for a cinematic inventor like Mr. Scorsese." though this is also emphatically his own work. Gracefully adapted by John Logan the movie involves a lonely melancholic orphan Hugo (Asa Butterfield) who in the early 1930s tends all the clocks in a Parisian train station. Seemingly abandoned by his uncle the station�۪s official timekeeper (Ray Winstone) Hugo lives alone deep in the station�۪s interior in a dark dusty secret apartment that was built for employees. There amid clocks gears pulleys jars and purloined toys he putters and sleeps and naturally dreams mostly of fixing a delicate automaton that his dead father a clockmaker (Jude Law) found once upon a time. The automaton is all that remains of a happy past." with a pen at the ready as if waiting for inspiration ��� is the key that will open its heart-shaped lock. After assorted stops and starts and quick getaways Hugo finds the key during an adventure involving the toy-store owner and his goddaughter Isabelle (Chlo�� Grace Moretz). A beloved wanted child she brings Hugo into her life which is how he discovers that the cantankerous shopkeeper with the white goatee and sad watchful eyes is Georges M̩li̬s (a touching Ben Kingsley)." but it means a great deal to this lovely movie. A magician turned moving-picture pioneer M̩li̬s (1861-1938) began his new career after seeing one of the first public film projections in Paris on Dec. 28 1895. Until then early moving pictures had been commercially exhibited on Kinetoscopes peephole machines that enabled viewers to watch brief films one person at a time. The image was tiny ��� less than two inches wide ��� and moving pictures didn�۪t become cinema as we know it until wizards like the French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumi̬re created machines like the cin̩matographe which projected larger-than-life images on screens that people watched as an audience." M̩li̬s enthralled with fantasies and trick films like ���A Trip to the Moon�۝ (1902). In this comic 16-minute science-fiction masterwork a gaggle of scientists in knee breeches fly in a rocket to the Moon where they encounter acrobatic creatures with lobster claws amid puffs of smoke and clever cinematic sleights of hand. In the film�۪s most famous image the rocket lands splat in the eye of the Man in the Moon causing him to squeeze out a fat tear. It was perhaps a prophetic image for M̩li̬s who after falling out of fashion and into obscurity ran a toy store in the Montparnasse station in Paris which is where he was later rediscovered." that luminous disk on which so many human fantasies (the Man in the Moon included) have been projected. In the book the Moon is something of a screen against which M̩li̬s�۪s most celebrated cinematic fantasy unfolds. Mr. Scorsese doesn�۪t exploit this lunar metaphor (perhaps he believes the Moon belongs to M̩li̬s) yet he locates plenty of cinematic poetry here particularly in the clock imagery which comes to represent moviemaking itself. The secret is in the clockwork Hugo�۪s father says to him in flashback sounding like an auteurist. Time counts in ���Hugo �۝ yes but what matters more is that clocks are wound and oiled so that their numerous parts work together as one." a trick entertainment and a wind-up toy and it springs to life instantly in a series of sweeping opening aerial shots that plunge you into the choreographed bustle of the train station. The first time you see Hugo he�۪s peering out from behind a large wall clock at the human comedy in the station. He�۪s staring through a cutout in the clock face an aperture through which he watches several characters who play supporting roles in a spectacle that is by turns slapstick mystery melodrama and romance including the menacing station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) a friendly flower vendor (Emily Mortimer) a woman with a dachshund (Frances de la Tour) and her suitor (Richard Griffiths). When Hugo gazes at them he�۪s viewer and director both." it follows Hugo as he speeds down halls a ladder a chute a staircase and yet more halls bringing to mind a Busby Berkeley set and Henry Hill�۪s long walk into the nightclub in ���Goodfellas.�۝ The camera keeps moving as does Hugo who chased by the station master and his Doberman sprints past James Joyce and Django Reinhardt lookalikes. It�۪s Paris of the Modernist imagination though really it�۪s movieland where gears loom like those in ���Modern Times�۝ and a man who�۪s part machine oils his bits like the Tin Man (while longing for a heart)." �۝ in which the young isolated Dalai Lama looks out across the city and it also evokes Mr. Scorsese�۪s well-known recollections about being an asthmatic child who watched life from windows ��� windows that of course put a frame around the world. This is a story shared by all children who begin as observers and turn (if all goes well) into participants. But ���Hugo�۝ is specifically about those observers of life who perhaps out of loneliness and with desire explore reality through its moving images which is why it�۪s also about the creation of a cinematic imagination ��� Hugo�۪s M̩li̬s�۪s Mr. Scorsese�۪s ours." one of fiction�۪s sentimental orphans and the world he invents yet unsurprisingly its most heartfelt passages are about M̩li̬s. The old filmmaker is as broken and in need of revival as the automaton and while you can guess what happens it�۪s the getting there ��� how the clock is wound ��� that surprises and often delights. Waves of melancholy wash over the story and keep the treacle at bay as do the spasms of broad comedy much of it nimbly executed by Mr. Baron Cohen. There is something poignant and paradoxical about Mr. Scorsese�۪s honoring a film pioneer in digital (and in 3-D no less) yet these moving pictures belong to the same land of dreams that M̩li̬s once explored left for a time and entered once again through the love of the audience." some child peril and a fierce dog." based on the novel ���The Invention of Hugo Cabret �۝ by Brian Selznick; director of photography Robert Richardson; edited by Thelma Schoonmaker; music by Howard Shore; production design by Dante Ferretti; costumes by Sandy Powell; visual effects supervisor Rob Legato; produced by Graham King Tim Headington Mr. Scorsese and Johnny Depp; released by Paramount Pictures.

This abrupt and rather frightening introduction ��� the viewer is pitched headlong not only into Sabina�۪s company but also into her condition ��� is an emphatic announcement of some of the film�۪s intentions." which turns her even in moments of relative calm into a twisted sputtering wreck is also a signal that appearances to the contrary ���A Dangerous Method�۝ (based on a play by the film�۪s screenwriter Christopher Hampton that was drawn from a book by John Kerr) is not just another decorous Oscar-season costume party. The rigor and repression on display here are hardly the quaint artifacts of a bygone social order which we in the audience can congratulate ourselves on having left behind. What we are witnessing rather is the raw liberating and terrifying emergence of a distinctly modern way of understanding and trying to assuage some of the pain and intensity of being alive." who calls the nascent method for dealing with problems like hers ���psychanalysis.�۝ Jung�۪s mentor in Vienna corrects him ��� he says it sounds more ���logical�۝ with the ���o�۝ in the middle ��� and since the mentor in question is none other than Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) the younger man defers at least on matters of pronunciation and at least for a while." ���A Dangerous Method�۝ traces the shifting relationships among its principal characters. Sabina is Jung�۪s patient his lover and finally a colleague. At the same time Freud and Jung act out a complicated Oedipal drama as the younger analyst evolves from promising disciple into Freud�۪s heir apparent and then a dangerous rebel whose mystical interests fly in the face of psychoanalytic orthodoxy." emotionally connected to Jung (who remains guiltily devoted to his aristocratic wife Emma played by Sarah Gadon) finds more intellectual affinity with Freud who reminds her at one point that unlike Jung they are both Jews. (This is of course perfectly true but in the context of the movie the observation is a bit surreal. Viggo? Keira? Who knew!)" even a century after their first articulation ��� but it also recognizes and communicates the erotic power of ideas. There are scenes of kinky activity between Sabina and Jung that will no doubt enjoy long life in specialized corners of the Internet but the most unsettling aspect of ���A Dangerous Method�۝ may be the links it suggests between sex and thinking. The mind is both slave and master of the body�۪s appetites and the absurd and terrifying task of stabilizing that dynamic in theory and in practice is embraced equally by the film and the fragile serious historical figures who inhabit it." even before traveling to Austria to meet Freud is the talking cure. She sits with her back to him and recalls traumatic episodes from her childhood while he takes notes and asks questions. This kind of scene is familiar enough ��� from Woody Allen and ���Portnoy�۪s Complaint�۝ and ���The Sopranos �۝ and maybe from real life as well ��� that seeing a primitive incarnation is at once droll and curiously exciting. It is also marvelous to see Freud that embattled colossus restored to his human dimensions by Mr. Mortensen. His sly performance is so convincingly full of humor warmth and vanity that it renders moot just about every other posthumous representation of the patriarch of psychoanalysis." Sabina Jung and Freud are engaged in an expedition into the uncharted territory of the unconscious. Jung and his patient in particular do so with a sense of novelty and risk. The feeling of stepping into terra incognita makes ���A Dangerous Method�۝ something of an adventure story. It also at times has the quiet uncanny mood of a horror movie albeit one whose monsters are invisible living inside the souls they menace." of course one of the great living practitioners of the horror genre with a history of bringing fears both primal and contemporary ��� about sex dreams technology the media the grossness of the body ��� to vivid shocking and grotesquely funny cinematic life.

Given its long stretches of earnest and erudite scientific talk ���A Dangerous Method�۝ might seem to be his calmest and most cerebral film yet." and Mr. Cronenberg�۪s fastidious and elegant compositions hum with the latent possibility of chaos and destruction. Jung with his neatly trimmed mustache and his studious Protestant politesse seems to embody an ideal of upright Germanic propriety. He is serious attentive and curiously passive becoming aware of his own feelings only when other people point them out to him." a fellow analyst sent to Jung by Freud who turns out to be a feral and charming emanation of pure id an imp of the Freudian perverse. Otto does not just sleep with his patients; he also takes the flouting of ethical norms as a therapeutic and moral necessity. He manages through a blend of rhetorical flim-flam and Byronic charisma to argue the fastidious Jung into bed with Sabina (though she is the one who makes the first move)." stammering (in a thick Russian accent) and making her already prominent eyes pop out of her skull. But what looks like willful freakishness is crucial to the film�۪s logic which depends partly on the contrast between Sabina�۪s hysteria and the respectable reserve of Carl and Emma�۪s domestic life and partly on Sabina�۪s growing ability to understand and express herself." Sabina is also an uncannily modern spirit whose torments are as recognizable as her symptoms are outlandish.

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/movies/rampart-starring-woody-harrelson-review.html
���Rampart�۝ tells a familiar story with such visual punch and hustling energy that it comes close to feeling like a new kind of movie though it�۪s more just a tough gloss on American crime stories past. Directed by Oren Moverman from a fast nasty at times queasily funny screenplay by him and James Ellroy it stars Woody Harrelson as Dave Brown one of those dirty cops who ooze out of the smog-kissed Los Angeles sprawl to keep the peace in paradise usually by breaking heads and gunning for trouble." whose crime novels include ���L.A. Confidential �۝ or one of his influences Joseph Wambaugh (���The Choirboys�۝) you will recognize Dave Brown the bullheaded red-necked cop who swings first asks later and calls the city a jungle and himself one of its soldiers. The language is no accident: For decades the Los Angeles Police Department followed a military model that made it a paradigm of ruthless efficiency in which police violence particularly against minorities was tolerated. By 1999 the year the movie opens the department was rocking from the revelation that cops in the anti-gang unit in the Rampart Division in central Los Angeles had been dealing drugs and worse." which is mentioned in passing but a fictional sometimes surrealistic exploration of the kind of mindset or maybe ideology personal and professional that led some Los Angeles cops to rob kill and turn into a gang of their own. It�۪s a vivid often mesmerizing portrait of a man rotting from the inside out though perhaps only partly because the organization he works for (though really against) and the world he inhabits are sick too. Yet why Dave does what he does is anyone�۪s guess because one of the movie�۪s strengths is that it finds meaning in his actions without trying to explain him. Some people it suggests remain mysteries which however maddening also helps make Dave insistently watchable." working in digital and with the great cinematographer Bobby Bukowski keeps something of a visual chokehold on Dave right from the start. The movie opens with a series of jump cuts that show Mr. Harrelson in profile in extreme close-up his face filling the left third of the screen. There�۪s something totemic about this face which stands out sharply against the colorful meaningfully blurred background. Dave may be patrolling the city listening to the radio smoking a cigarette but the neighborhoods under his watch are nothing but blots of color and light. You can�۪t see the people he�۪s passing and it becomes evident ��� as when he drives into a crowd scattering it with a raucous laugh ��� that neither does he." character psychology is all (or a lot of it anyway). There isn�۪t a strong story tethering Dave one of those heists or rackets of generic cop stories but instead a succession of crises most with no obvious solution. He�۪s in a relationship with not one woman but two Barbara (Cynthia Nixon) and Catherine (Anne Heche) sisters with whom he has daughters. The families live in adjacent houses that Dave wanders in and out of much as he seems to do in their lives. Mostly he flops in front of the TV though he also comically pleads for one of the women (both ex-wives) to sleep with him." Rampart and politicians and the district attorney�۪s office (whose numbers include an excellent Sigourney Weaver) start circling." a beauty with defeated eyes Linda (Robin Wright perfect) who he grows to suspect has it in for him though it�۪s his old friend a crooked ex-cop Hartshorn (a wonderful Ned Beatty) who may be the bigger worry. As things go from bad to worse the sweat on Dave�۪s face turns into a river the visuals grow progressively baroque all the women move farther away and the walls close in like the grave." �۝ his well-received directing debut about two soldiers played by Mr. Harrelson and Ben Foster who bring the news of the dead back home. (Mr. Foster has a small role in ���Rampart�۝ as a homeless man and served as one of the movie�۪s producers.) It was already clear that Mr. Moverman knew how to let actors go deep so it�۪s no surprise that the performers in his new movie are uniformly very good and often better than that starting with Mr. Harrelson who brings both a raw intensity and a necessary lightness of touch to his unsentimental performance.

the year that Marilyn Monroe would have turned 50 Larry McMurtry wrote that she ���is right in there with our major ghosts: Hemingway the Kennedy brothers ��� people who finished with American life before America had time to finish with them.�۝ Almost a half-century after her death the world or at least its necrophiliac fantasists still haven�۪t finished with Monroe and try to resurrect her again and again in movies books songs and glamour layouts featuring dewy and ruined ing̩nues. Maybe it�۪s because it�۪s so difficult to imagine her as Old Marilyn that she has become a Ghost of Hollywood Past a phantom that periodically materializes to show us things that have been." �۝ with Michelle Williams as the Ghost. The movie is largely based on a slim 2000 book that a British documentary filmmaker Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne in a role of many smiles and little depth) claimed was a true account of an intimate interlude he spent with Monroe in 1956 while they were making ���The Prince and the Showgirl.�۝ At the time Monroe was newly married to Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) and hoped that the film based on a Terence Rattigan play would help her move past sexpot roles. But the shoot turned into a clash of egos and cultures that threw her leading her co-star and director Laurence Olivier to damn her as ���the stupidest most self-indulgent little tart I�۪ve ever come across.�۝" an assessment cemented by the miscast Kenneth Branagh�۪s intermittently amusing unctuous take on Olivier as a pitifully vain insensitive clod. Those familiar with Olivier who was 49 when he made ���Showgirl�۝ and still strikingly handsome may be distracted by the physical differences between him and Branagh whose soft face registers as a blur compared with Olivier�۪s sculptured solidity. Branagh makes up for this disparity somewhat with his crisp at times clipped enunciation and a physical performance that gives Olivier enough vitality so that when early in the character sweeps into his production office with his wife Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond a wan placeholder for the original) he dazzles Clark and jolts this slow-stirring movie awake." the son of the art historian Kenneth Clark decided at 23 as he put it to run away to the circus by working in the movies an easy enough goal because his parents were friends with Olivier and Leigh. He became a glorified gofer on ���Showgirl�۝ (officially its third assistant director) a position that involved managing Monroe who during the shoot soon went from bad to worse from late to missing in action. Her already strained marriage was one reason; Olivier was another. ���Just be sexy �۝ he told Monroe ���isn�۪t that what you do?�۝ No wonder she misbehaved: The man she idolized as the world�۪s greatest actor ��� and whom her production company hired ��� was a chauvinist bum." and she is similarly out of the grasp of this movie. Ms. Williams tries her best and sometimes that�۪s almost enough. She�۪s too thin for the role more colorlessly complected than creamy but she whispers and wobbles nicely. (The costumes hug her tight but wrongly round out her breasts which should thrust like rockets ready for liftoff.)" but a script by Adrian Hodges that hews faithfully to Clark�۪s clich̩s. Instead of the complex woman familiar from the better books about her the film offers a catalog of Monroe stereotypes: child woman smiling exhibitionist shrieking neurotic the barefooted free spirit and lamentably the martyr teetering in heels toward her doom." but the intimations of disaster don�۪t fit a movie that works so hard to be breezily easily likable. Everything on screen looks good and period-appropriate if also too manicured as if the past had been digitally spruced up. Mr. Curtis who has long directed for television (his credits include the 1999 BBC production of ���David Copperfield�۝) here tends to arrange everything in the frame neatly often by putting people and other focal points dead center. This isn�۪t uncommon in comedy where such centeredness helps build tension as you wait for comic anarchists to wreck a meticulously organized world. In ���My Week With Marilyn �۝ this visual approach adds nothing and comes across as generic as do as the jerky handheld newsreel shots and popping photo bulbs." busyness and Zoe Wanamaker�۪s darkly comic toadying turn as Monroe�۪s acting coach Paula Strasberg as well as always the promise of the real Monroe. (Emma Watson has a thankless part as a diversion for Clark.) Mr. Curtis�۪s most unwise filmmaking move however is to put Ms. Williams continually into familiar Monroe poses and quote her famous photos and films ��� nude Marilyn tousled Marilyn singing Marilyn ��� a strategy that undermines his efforts to turn the idol into a person. He shows that Monroe is aware enough of her image that she knows ��� with a wink a smile a shake and a shimmy ��� how to turn her persona on for public consumption but he too can�۪t escape wanting and always returning to that Marilyn Monroe." who like this film would like nothing better." drug and alcohol abuse and discreet female nudity." based on the diaries of Colin Clark ���The Prince the Showgirl and Me�۝ and ���My Week With Marilyn�۝; director of photography Ben Smithard; edited by Adam Recht; music by Conrad Pope with ���Marilyn�۪s Theme�۝ by Alexandre Desplat piano solos by Lang Lang; production design by Donal Woods; costumes by Jill Taylor; produced by David Parfitt and Harvey Weinstein; released by the Weinstein Company.

�۝ the latest and best of the movies about a girl her vampire and their impossible ridiculously appealing ��� yes I surrendered ��� love story. Marked by a canny mix of violence and chastity the franchise has always had plenty of broken heads to go along with its pure thoughts but here it also features a marital bed reduced to kindling after a rough night. If that doesn�۪t sound like the series that has kept millions of prepubescent viewers virtuously rapt you�۪re right. But little Bella is all grown up now and while Edward is still more zomboid than juicily predatory this time not everything else on screen is dead too." the people behind the ���Twilight�۝ movies can be forgiven for stretching out the screen experience for as long as possible. (���Breaking Dawn�۝ 2 hits next November.) And after all so much does happen in this movie which takes the arc of human experience ��� birth and death and everything in between ��� and works it up into a rich sudsy lather. In the past Bella (played with increasing confidence by Kristen Stewart) has been almost eclipsed by Edward (Robert Pattinson) his bloodsucking brood and their battles. Here though she returns as the emotional and psychological cornerstone in a series in which the center of gravity has shifted from frenzied action and reaction to love." with the exception of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who�۪s off sulking having lost his claim on Bella. Poor wolf never stood a chance; vampires aren�۪t just hot (and sometimes scorching as on the HBO show ���True Blood�۝) they have in recent years also become the favorite go-to romantic male lead the last possibly sole defense against the nice-guy tide embodied by the Apatowesque freaks and geeks and their bromantic brethren. The vampire in other words is the only man (other than George Clooney) who can still sweep a woman off her feet ��� so what if he�۪s actually dead?" in truth gives the male vampire a great romantic advantage because it allows him to engage in the kind of old-fashioned dash and derring-do ��� with one arm around the girl and the other smacking away foes ��� that might be laughed or scolded off the screen. (The age of the chivalrous superhero ended when Christopher Reeve hung up his Superman cape in 1987.) One of the complex pleasures of the ���Twilight�۝ movies is the absolute sincerity with which they�۪ve revived the unironic romantic male lead an ideal that works (when the movies do anyway) because it�۪s Bella who actively even desperately desires Edward. He�۪s her choice not that of her parents or anyone else." now comes marriage a surprisingly rollicking honeymoon and almost immediately a horrendous pregnancy that the director Bill Condon makes so palpably disturbing that it might cause David Cronenberg the master of body horror to wince. Mr. Condon handles the little bit of action in ���Breaking Dawn�۝ capably but it�۪s his work with (and sometimes around) the actors and his ability to translate ideas visually that lifts this movie above the rest. When Bella first appears she enters wobbling in uncharacteristic towering heels an image that instantly suggests her unsteadiness before her wedding and as she moves toward the altar Mr. Condon further telegraphs her unease by filling the screen with red rose petals that turn into a sanguineous hallucination." Mr. Condon whose earlier films include ���Dreamgirls�۝ and ���Gods and Monsters �۝ can also offer up and without a suggestion of filmmaker embarrassment the sight of Mr. Lautner ripping off his shirt. As Jacob Edward�۪s long-suffering oft-rejected rival for Bella�۪s affection Mr. Lautner has plenty of reasons to strip angry: he can turn into a wolf for starters and Jacob�۪s musculature has long been one of the most special of the movies�۪ effects. That�۪s reason enough for Mr. Condon to get the character�۪s shirt off as is the unavoidable truth that Mr. Lautner whose pumped physique and flat affect bring to mind one of those friendly pizza delivery boys in a pornographic movie remains a dish best served with as few words and clothes as possible." Mr. Pattinson is scarcely any better than his brother in beefcake. If that doesn�۪t matter it�۪s because Mr. Pattinson�۪s heaviest lifting is over. His character is already well sketched in and now all that remains is for the actor to play the part of the passionate potentially dangerous vampire husband which he ��� or rather his smart director ��� conveys with the startling image of Edward�۪s hands clenching the honeymoon bed until it explodes under his powerful touch. This image of sexual rough play is further capped the next morning by bruises now tattooing Bella�۪s body branding that ��� along with her smiles (a private reverie reminiscent of Diane Lane�۪s postcoital raptures in ���Unfaithful�۝) ��� shifts the story into another world." gilding it with a necessary sense of humor ��� Bella and Edward�۪s white honeymoon bed glows as portentously as an altar for a sacrificial virgin ��� and imbuing it with a love and a gift for melodrama. He slathers on the music (���melodrama�۝ comes from song or music drama) lets Ms. Stewart rock and the emotions roil. He resurrects the awkward teenage yearning that enlivened the first ���Twilight�۝ movie but also transforms that initial crude hunger into something deeper. Mostly he brings Bella toward her happily-ever-after by giving this movie over to her her dreams and her desires as in a cosmic montage sequence worthy of ���The Tree of Life �۝ but you know shorter.

Ms. Barkin�۪s exhausting performance is too shrill by half but impressive nonetheless." which won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at this year�۪s Sundance Film Festival is structured around histrionic set pieces in which Lynn clashes with Elliot Paul and Doris whose composure shatters in a weepy soliloquy that registers as a flashy piece of screenwriting while straining too hard to shoot the moon.

Lighter in mood softer in political outlook and less narratively ambitious than the first ���Happy Feet�۝ (2006) the new movie takes place in Antarctica where thousands of emperor penguins hang out doing familiar animated penguin things like gobbling fish braving the weather and breaking into tightly choreographed song and dance." the gotta-dance dancing fool whose syncopated tapping and stomping moves are as they were in the first movie provided by the genius tap man Savion Glover via motion capture. (In this technology an actor�۪s movements are mapped onto a digital model that becomes part of the computer-generated image. If you�۪ve been lucky and seen Mr. Glover perform it�۪s clear that Mumble doesn�۪t have the real dancer�۪s moves just a shadow approximation.) Mumble has settled down or something with his warbling penguin pal ��� it�۪s unclear here if penguins marry even in children�۪s movies ��� Gloria (Alecia Moore a k a Pink working her pipes) and together they�۪ve hatched a ball of soft gray fluff Erik (the gently pipsqueaky Ava Acres)." as apparently required by the current rules of Western animated filmmaking has issues: namely he can�۪t dance. This means naturally that he has to find himself so he can be free to be you and me or really just Erik. That he does shouldn�۪t after years of Disney-style self-actualization cinema come as a surprise. Like father like son; like Disney like everyone else. And like first movie like sequel. To that seemingly predetermined end as in the first ���Happy Feet �۝ which turned on Mumble�۪s isolation-evolution- socialization this one partly involves Erik�۪s inner journey which parallels an outer voyage that takes him beyond the penguin colony with a couple of de rigueur sidekicks Bo (Meibh Campbell) and Atticus (the marvelously named Benjamin Lil P-Nut Flores Jr.)." perhaps because the director George Miller is somewhat bored by the little outsider shtick. Whatever the case Erik and his need are the least compelling parts of ���Happy Feet Two �۝ which was written by Mr. Miller Gary Eck Warren Coleman and Paul Livingston who appear to have greatly enjoyed spitballing jokes. Although there are foreboding images of melting glaciers (an ecological disaster that traps the colony spurring a rescue attempt) the movie mostly involves cornball stuff and nonsense the best of which is voiced and sometimes sung with enthusiasm by two brilliantly orange krill Will (Brad Pitt) and Bill (Matt Damon) whose dumb and dumber routine approaches Vladimir and Estragon levels of existential dark humor." though an elephant seal Bryan the Beachmaster (Richard Carter) or rather his exquisitely animated schnoz (technically his proboscis) has his moments. Truly the movie could use more of Will and Bill and their adventures beyond the krill swarm. Will yearns to be his own crustacean and Bill yearns to be with Will a desire that turns their part of the movie into a sweetly amusing bromance. Mostly the krill allow Mr. Miller to cut loose from the penguins which he does both in beautiful images of the undulating orange swarm that echo the  aurora australis that transfixes the penguins up on land and in extreme close-ups of Bill and Will that because the movie was shot in 3D turn the humble wee creatures into the approachable heroic colossi they are."

Was he primarily a designer an engineer a computer nerd or an artist? A benevolent guru or the center of a cult of personality?" �۝ a lively new documentary by Jason Cohn and Bill Jersey. The subjects are Charles and Ray Eames a married couple (sometimes thought to be brothers because of their names) whose approach to product design and the presentation of information was in its way as influential as Mr. Jobs�۪s. Their name is still most commonly associated with the chairs sold by the Herman Miller company but the film argues that their characteristic mix of the practical and the aesthetic has left traces in nearly every aspect of contemporary life." his second wife was an artist and together they ran a design studio in Venice Calif. that was a hive of creativity. Charles arrived there in the 1940s from Michigan and his migration from the industrial Midwest to Southern California was part of a larger cultural and aesthetic shift. The house that he and Ray built in Pacific Palisades with its simple boxy shapes; abundant light; and whimsical ornaments was a domestic temple for a new less austere kind of Modernism one that joined a streamlined functional practical style with bright colors and pleasing shapes." but it also contains a paradox. The Eameses who had long-lasting contracts with Westinghouse I.B.M. and other large corporations were selling the notion that individualism could not only coexist with commercial standardization but that idiosyncratic expression could also flourish within the collective rituals of consumption. The stuff you buy if it�۪s the right stuff is part of what makes you what you are." tall and tousle-haired with a trademark bow tie and a professorial air was both awkward and charismatic. Ray with her bangs and old-fashioned dresses is described by one colleague as ���a delicious little dumpling.�۝ Together they look in archival footage captivatingly odd and they seem to have captured the loyalty of a great many talented young designers who look back fondly if sometimes incredulously at the long years spent working at the studio." the sexism of the age pushed her at least publicly into the margins." hilarious appearance the two of them made on ���Home �۝ in which the chipper hostess takes great pains to keep Ray in her silent subordinate place making Charles the reluctant center of attention. Later their marriage was tested by his infidelity and their partnership was weakened by a loss of common creative purpose. After Charles died in 1978 Ray tried to keep their work going until her death 10 years later." and the most gratifying thing about ���Eames�۝ is that it shows in marvelous detail how their work was an extension of themselves and how their distinct personalities melded into a unique and protean force. The film is also appropriately busy and abundant: full of objects information stories and people organized with hectic elegance." housewares films exhibitions ��� at times it is hard to keep track of everything the Eameses were making. But the scale and variety of the enterprise also establish them as precursors of digital culture which combines technology with handicraft and layers information and images into what Charles Eames called (meaning it in a good way) ���information overload.�۝" but this one comes close serving both the fact-gathering imperatives of biography and also the need especially important with subjects like these to convey a sense of the beauty and meaning of what they did." 323 Avenue of the Americas at Third Street Greenwich Village.

But that work takes up only part of the film. The other focus is on who came along to help with the digging: a small group of survivors now near the end of long lives lived mostly in Australia where they relocated after the war." they create an aching contrast: these few are living reminders of all the human potential that was lost. The film would be stronger if it told us a little more about what the survivors have been doing since the camp was liberated by the Soviets in 1944 but their reactions to revisiting the camp are wrenching to watch. And when they and the rest of the archaeological team begin unearthing the coins and jewelry that were buried more than six decades ago the message that the Holocaust victims were people not just statistics is loud and clear."

Matt gets a lot of things right in the end but along the way he mishandles nearly everything sometimes because of impulsiveness and sometimes because he is paralyzed unable to trust or locate his own best instincts." meanwhile have never been keener or more generous. Mr. Clooney bolstered by his effortless magnetism has always been an excellent ensemble player and while he is at the center of ���The Descendants �۝ he does not dominate the movie. Everyone in it is wonderful: Ms. Woodley (���The Secret Life of the American Teenager�۝) giving one of the toughest smartest most credible adolescent performances in recent memory; Nick Krause as her goofy sidekick Sid; Robert Forster as Elizabeth�۪s permanently enraged father; Beau Bridges as Matt�۪s cousin Hugh."

partly because there are so many wild and scary imaginative possibilities." �۝ an excursion from the sad to the sublime by way of the preposterous the always controversial Danish director Lars von Trier offers his own highly personal version of apocalypse: a celestial collision rendered in surprisingly lovely digital effects and accompanied by mighty blasts of Wagner. The film takes its title from a rogue planet that appears suddenly in the night sky and seems to be heading straight for Earth." not coincidentally names an emotional disorder described by Freud as ���a profoundly painful dejection cessation of interest in the outside world loss of the capacity to love inhibition of all activity and a lowering of the self-regarding feelings to a degree that finds utterance in self-reproaches and self-revilings and culminates in a delusional expectation of punishment.�۝" of course one reason people go to a Lars von Trier movie in the first place. Suffering ��� predominantly though not exclusively the suffering of women ��� is both his favorite subject and his preferred method. He is a crafty sadist but also for all his tricks and provocations a sincere one." and yet it nonetheless leaves behind a glow of aesthetic satisfaction. Total obliteration happens on an intimate scale and the all-encompassing metaphysical nature of the drama leaves room for gentleness as well as operatic cruelty. The machinery of mass panic and media frenzy that juices up most films on this subject is notably absent. Instead difficult emotions are registered in close-ups of individual human faces and a perverse persuasive idea rises to the surface. The end of the world as we know it might just turn out to be beautiful." a young woman whose history of crippling depression overshadows her lavish wedding party and threatens to blight her chances at future happiness. In the course of a long hectic night she comes increasingly undone to the bewilderment of her new husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) and the exasperation of her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Compared with the humorless grimly responsible Claire Justine is impulsive self-indulgent and charming: the flighty grasshopper to her sister�۪s responsible dutiful ant." that is ��� reverses the traditional moral of that fable. In the second half of the movie Justine�۪s fatalism will prove a more viable (or at least a more graceful) response to the prospect of global annihilation than Claire�۪s anxious practicality. During the wedding though the catastrophe which has been foretold in a gorgeous dreamlike overture full of dark clouds and nightmarish images of doom is not something the guests seem to be aware of. Rather the imminence of an all-obliterating big bang is a piece of information the audience possesses in advance of the characters on screen an open secret that makes their earnest trivial doings all the more dreadful and absurd." the spectacle of matrimony provides a rich inexhaustible vein of comic and melodramatic potential ��� chance encounters simmering grudges sexual intrigue dysfunctional outbursts ��� and Mr. von Trier is hardly the first filmmaker to use a wedding as a kind of controlled experiment in human waywardness. Robert Altman Noah Baumbach and Jonathan Demme might come to mind during the first hour of ���Melancholia �۝ to say nothing of the houses of Windsor and Kardashian." complete with stables a golf course and manicured expanses of lawn. English is the language and dollars are the currency but this is less a specific America (a place Mr. von Trier has never visited and the theoretical location of most of his recent films) than an abstract space of moneyed entitlement. The aggressive opulence of 21st-century capital coexists somewhat awkwardly with an older aristocratic elegance. You might have seen some of the wedding guests last year at Marienbad while others more recently might have sneered at you from their seats in the first-class cabin as you pushed your way back to coach. Claire�۪s pompous husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) owns the property which seems to be both a high-end resort and his own private family retreat." and an integral aspect of Mr. von Trier�۪s creative personality has been neutralized here. The men who hover around the wedding including the clueless Michael and the officious John are not menacing just useless." who gives his prized employee a promotion and a deadline on what is supposed to be the happiest night of her life. Justine�۪s parents are the pathologically bitter Charlotte Rampling and the pathologically whimsical John Hurt and the ensemble (also including Udo Kier as the imperious wedding planner and Brady Corbet as a newly hired colleague of Justine�۪s) proceeds through the expected rituals. There are loud arguments awkward toasts bad sex confrontations with the help and a few moments of serene and luminous bliss." of course amounts to nothing since everything and everyone will be ashes soon enough. That is Justine�۪s state of mind and Ms. Dunst is remarkably effective at conveying both the acute anguish and the paralyzing hollowness of depression. To the extent that the destructive potential of Melancholia is a metaphor for her private melancholia it is perfectly apt. One of the chief torments of serious depression is how disproportionate and all-consuming the internal personal sorrow can feel." effective existential joke ��� in Justine�۪s discovery that her hyperbolic despair may turn out to be rooted in an accurate and objective assessment of the state of the universe. Mr. von Trier inspired (if that�۪s the word) to make this movie by his own experience of depression gleefully turns a psychological drama inside out. The world Justine declares in her darkest moment of clarity deserves its awful fate.

The movie finds in a relatively banal thoroughly senseless American story of crime and punishment enough darkness to make you wonder about the title. Is death which unites murderers with their victims and executioners and ultimately with everyone else the abyss that Mr. Herzog wants us to contemplate? Or is he directing our attention toward a black hole that sits in the middle of life?" interviewing killers survivors witnesses and officials in law enforcement and corrections is polite even when asking uncomfortable questions and the seriousness of his intentions allows humor and absurdity to bubble up amid all the pain. He never appears on camera but his unmistakable voice ��� dry precise carrying the accent of his native Bavaria ��� ties together this tapestry of conflicting testimony inchoate emotion and unredeemed ugliness." ���Into the Abyss�۝ superficially resembles the kind of titillating moralizing true-crime shockumentary that is a staple of off-hours cable television.

Sandra Stotler her son Adam and his friend Jeremy Richardson were murdered apparently because the killers wanted the red Camaro in Ms. Stotler�۪s garage. About a week later after a shootout in a shopping center parking lot two young men were arrested in the case. One Jason Burkett received a life sentence. The other Michael Perry was sentenced to death." in the summer of 2010. He has a lively ingratiating manner though his protestations of innocence and his expressions of religious faith may not seem entirely convincing." despite his clearly stated moral opposition to capital punishment is he advocating a political position. He is instead ��� as he so often has in fictional features and documentaries alike ��� probing the contradictions of the human heart in which nobility and savagery are so entwined as to be almost indistinguishable." and unexpectedly revealing chat with a death row chaplain Mr. Herzog plunges into what you might call the philosophical forensics of the Conroe murders. He listens patiently as a courteous sheriff�۪s deputy reconstructs the investigation and allows himself to wonder why the crime took place. Conversations with Mr. Perry and Mr. Burkett don�۪t yield a satisfying answer but as the film pursues the facts of the event it paints a vivid and disturbing picture of the broken society that made their crimes possible." and intimations of serious family dysfunction but there is also ample evidence of love loyalty and righteousness." he is not aloof or neutral either. What makes the film bearable ��� what keeps the viewer just at the near edge of despair ��� is the ethical passion that drives his inquiry and his compassionate curiosity about how people make sense of their own actions and motivations." a quality that distinguishes his recent documentaries notably ���Grizzly Man �۝ ���Encounters at the End of the World�۝ and ���Cave of Forgotten Dreams.�۝ All of those come to think of it could have been called ���Into the Abyss�۝ ��� the title would also suit ���Aguirre the Wrath of God�۝ and just about anything else starring Klaus Kinski ��� and this film is linked to its predecessors by a fascination with human behavior in extremis. What is most disconcerting for an American viewer is how close to home the extremity is as if the heart of darkness lurked among your friends and neighbors." whose mother and brother were so cruelly taken from her. An interview with Mr. Burkett�۪s father who is serving a long prison sentence is also heartbreaking: a chronicle of waste and failure delivered with unflinching plain-spoken honesty." what rescues ���Into the Abyss�۝ from its title is the stubborn individuality of the people it discovers none of them entirely innocent or utterly evil all of them vivid and memorable. They cling to life and look for meaning in its darkest episodes with a tenacity that drives home the terrible price of killing whether it is a result of criminal impulse or state policy."

with their crepuscular tales of good and evil the tenderness of the love story in ���J. Edgar�۝ comes as a shock. Anchored by a forceful vulnerable Leonardo DiCaprio who lays bare J. Edgar Hoover�۪s humanity despite the odds and an impasto of old-coot movie makeup this latest jolt from Mr. Eastwood is a look back at a man divided and of the ties that bind private bodies with public politics and policies. With sympathy ��� for the individual not his deeds ��� it portrays a 20th-century titan who with secrets and bullets a will to power and the self-promotional skills of a true star built a citadel of information in which he burrowed deep." Mr. Eastwood working from a smart script by Dustin Lance Black (���Milk�۝) takes a dynamic approach to history (even as it speaks to contemporary times) primarily by toggling between Hoover�۪s early and later years his personal and public lives while the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The film opens in the early 1960s with a shot of the Justice Department building the original home of the bureau establishing the location as well as the idea that this is also the story of an institution. As Hoover croaks in the voice-over (���Communism is not a political party ��� it is a disease�۝) the scene shifts inside where the camera scans the death mask he kept of John Dillinger former Public Enemy No. 1 and then stops on Hoover�۪s pale face: a sagging facade." stooped balding his countenance as gray as his suit Hoover enters while in the midst of dictating his memoirs to the first of several young agents (Ed Westwick) who appear intermittently typing the version of history that he feeds them and that is dramatized in flashback. The earliest episode involves the 1919 bombing of the home of the attorney general A. Mitchell Palmer (Geoff Pierson) a cataclysmic event that ��� accompanied by terrified screams and a wide-eyed Hoover rushing to the conflagration ��� signals the birth of an anti-radical. Hoover a former librarian subsequently helps deport hundreds of real and suspected extremists; hires his lifelong secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts); and begins amassing secret files on possible and improbable enemies that like a cancer grow." Mr. Eastwood likes to take his time inside a scene ��� the film efficiently condenses history packing Hoover�۪s nearly 50 years with the bureau into 2 hours 17 minutes. By 1924 Hoover was its deputy; a few years later in real time seemingly minutes in movie time he meets Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer the Winklevoss twins in ���The Social Network�۝). Tall and impeccably groomed Tolson is a golden boy who here at least physically recalls the 1920s tennis star Bill Tilden and quickly becomes Hoover�۪s deputy and constant longtime companion. The men meet in a bar introduced by a mutual acquaintance. Hoover blusters through the easygoing introductions his eyes darting away from the friendly newcomer literally looming over him." Tolson applies for a job at the F.B.I. and is eagerly hired by Hoover inaugurating a bond that became the subject of titters but that Mr. Eastwood conveys matter-of-factly without either condescension or sentimentality. Before long Tolson is helping Hoover buy his suits and straightening his collar and the two are dining vacationing and policing in lock step. Tolson becomes the moon over Hoover�۪s shoulder a source of light in the shadows. Even the ashcan colors and chiaroscuro lighting brighten. In these scenes Mr. Hammer gives Tolson a teasing smile and the naked face of a man in love. Mr. DiCaprio by contrast beautifully puts across the idea that the sexually inexperienced Hoover while enlivened by the friendship may not have initially grasped the meaning of its depth of feeling." and it�۪s his handling of Hoover and Tolson�۪s relationship that as much as the late-act revelation of the pathological extent of Hoover�۪s dissembling lifts the film from the usual biopic blahs. Mr. Eastwood doesn�۪t just shift between Hoover�۪s past and present his intimate life and popular persona he also puts them into dialectic play showing repeatedly how each informed the other. In one stunning sequence he cuts between anonymous F.B.I. agents surreptitiously bugging a bedroom (that of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. a resonant haunting presence seen and heard elliptically and on TV) and Tolson and Hoover walking and then standing alone side by side in an elevator in a tight depthless frontally centered shot that makes it look as if they were lying together in bed." the lack of concrete evidence about their relationship means that the film effectively outs them. Certainly a case for outing Hoover especially can be made both because he was a public figure who to some was a monster and destroyer of lives and because he was a possibly gay man who hounded homosexuals (and banned them from the F.B.I.). But this film doesn�۪t drag Hoover from the closet for salacious kicks or political payback: it shows the tragic personal and political fallout of the closet. And Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Black�۪s expansive view of human frailties means that it�۪s Hoover�۪s relationship with Tolson ��� and the foreboding it stirs up in Hoover�۪s watchful mother (Judi Dench) ��� that greatly humanizes him." which as the very title announces is less the story of Hoover the public institution than of J. Edgar the private man. It would take a mini-series to name every one of his victims and enemies a veritable Who�۪s Who of 20th-century notables and a book as fat as Curt Gentry�۪s biography ���J. Edgar Hoover�۝ to communicate the sweep of the man�۪s power and impact on history. In crucial representative scenes the film instead offers quick sketches of the more familiar Hoover ��� the top cop and hunter of men (always ready for his close-up); the presidential courtier and exploiter; the wily Washington strategist and survivor ��� who decade after decade fended off threats real and imagined and foes like Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Jeffrey Donovan)." or rather on the F.B.I. his sepulchral home away from home has been told before including in Hoover-approved howlers like the studio flick ���The F.B.I. Story�۝ (1959). At once a fascinating psychological portrait and an act of Hollywood revisionism ���J. Edgar�۝ doesn�۪t set out to fully right the record that Hoover distorted at times with the help of studio executives (including those at Warner Brothers which is also releasing this film). Instead Mr. Eastwood explores the inner life of a lonely man whose fortress was also his stage. From there surrounded by a few trusted souls he played out a fiction in which he was as heroic as a James Cagney G-man (despite a life with a mother Norman Bates would recognize) but finally as weak compromised and human as those whose lives he helped crush."

Only once does Mr. Maysles break with his trademark self-effacing style to recall when he and his brother David (who died in 1987) filmed the Beatles when they arrived in New York City in 1964.

Not surprisingly the film boasts more than a few memorable performances ��� by Elaine Bromka Park Overall and Kelly McAndrew among others ��� and one truly remarkable turn by the stage great Brian Murray as a grandfatherly Southern lawyer with a voice as smooth and warm as a tumbler of bourbon a role worthy of Will Rogers." ���In the Family�۝ is also one of the most accomplished and undersold directorial debuts this year." present-tense study of evolving cultural values in the heartland and an unsentimental portrait of a family devastated by the tragedy of an early death." but his father Cody (Trevor St. John) began dating again not long after.

What makes ���In the Family�۝ so elusive is that it is structured less by story events than whisper-soft subtleties of characterization and unspoken social subtexts. You will for instance not hear one overt reference to sexuality race or gay marriage." �۝ and one might see the film as a cultural conservative plea to extend traditional marital values and legal rights to same-sex couples. And yet the film�۪s ending does not reconstitute the traditional family as such but rather suggests a more expansive and even progressive idea of what ���family�۝ might mean. Scenes unfold in contemplative long takes and carefully framed deep-focus compositions. The style is too dramatically focused and pictorially unfussy to be classified as art-house minimalism. It is also too deliberative to be mistaken for a Hollywood prestige picture. Mr. Wang betrays his theatrical background with a slightly plodding tendency to begin and end scenes with arrivals or departures. But while some heads and tails could be trimmed the pacing works quite well." it is extremely acute. One senses that he is rediscovering the rules of cinema on his own.

There�۪s one patient in a bed but another man Joe is standing and he�۪s ready to leave. Nearly dressed he slides on a ring and a watch that slip now too loose for his thinned body. He says so long to the other patient jokes about his waiting limo and disappears into Chicago alone hunching against the cold. His ride turns out to be a city bus. When he stops for a drink the bartender says ���I thought you were dead.�۝ He isn�۪t the only one who does." but there�۪s nothing obviously attractive about Joe either (they�۪re made for each other) which is partly what makes him intriguing from the get go.

A naturally watchable screen presence with a scoop of silvery white hair and a mustache that�۪s as lovingly groomed as a show poodle he looks as if he had been born to play men like Joe though he�۪s equally comfortable working on the other side of the law.

That�۪s to the movie�۪s good because Mr. Maggio�۪s strengths here are his people (not their stories) a sense of intimacy and textured place rather than the generic hoops he forces the characters to jump through after Joe climbs those stairs and meets two strangers Jenny (Jamie Anne Allman) and her young daughter Angelina (Meredith Droeger)." lost his keys anything but entered his old apartment where Jenny and Angelina and a thicket of clich̩s wait.

and it takes no special insight to point out that the guys who make and star in those movies tend to be pretty well off themselves. You can call this hypocrisy but I prefer to think of it as one of the cultural contradictions of capitalism that all of us have to live with." �۝ an action comedy produced by Brian Grazer directed by Brett Ratner and starring Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy. The previous sentence could be expressed mathematically as a whole bunch of zeros which is to say that the $20 million that is one object of the heist in question is small change. The movie�۪s makers and marketers surely expect to take much more than that from you and your friends in the next 48 hours or so and you could do worse than to chip in your share with a little something extra for the Coca-Cola Company." chaotic and cartoonish dose of populism set in a Manhattan luxury high-rise at the southwestern corner of Central Park from which the name ���Trump�۝ has been excised with the utmost digital care. At the top of this heap lives Arthur Shaw a Wall Street titan played with twinkly malevolence by Alan Alda." who spent years on ���M*A*S*H�۝ turning himself into a paradigm of niceness has since relished subverting that image and he generously supplies occasions for the audience to snarl and hiss and gasp at him in indignant disbelief. A genial plutocrat Shaw fancies himself a man of the people. He loves to remind Josh Kovaks the building�۪s manager (Mr. Stiller) that they grew up in the same Queens neighborhood and he is generally expert at disguising his condescension as bonhomie." or perhaps something worse (or at least easier to explain in a 10- or 15-second burst of expository dialogue). Among the millions that have disappeared under his watch are the pension fund of the building�۪s staff and the life savings of a beloved doorman Lester (Stephen McKinley Henderson) whose dreams of a comfortable retirement are shattered when the F.B.I. arrives to arrest Shaw for fraud." and so his outrage at the criminality of a man he had admired and envied is mingled with a sense of responsibility. He hatches a scheme to extract restitution enlisting a bunch of other aggrieved parties mostly fellow tower workers to burgle Shaw�۪s penthouse during the Macy�۪s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Josh believes that $20 million in cash is hidden in a secret safe though the real situation turns out to be much more complicated." generating suspense by focusing on the precise arrangements necessary to bring a brazen and improbable crime to fruition. ���Tower Heist�۝ is emphatically not one of those movies. Important plot points seem to have been edited away ��� or never bothered with in the first place ��� and credulity is strained at nearly every point sometimes amusingly (as when a car dangles from a skyscraper apparently unnoticed by the crowds below) and sometimes annoyingly." it is more in the manner of Daffy Duck than Errol Flynn (or heaven help us Russell Crowe). Which is great ��� or would be if Mr. Ratner were daring or disciplined enough to unleash the full farcical anarchy that ���Tower Heist�۝ occasionally promises but rarely delivers. Josh has a motley crew backing him up including Gabourey Sidibe as a housekeeper Michael Pe̱a as an elevator operator Casey Affleck as a concierge and Matthew Broderick as an evicted tower tenant an unemployed stock trader whose misery results from the general financial malaise rather than his upstairs neighbor�۪s corruption. They are abetted by a sympathetic F.B.I. agent (T̩a Leoni) and coached by Slide a hoodlum played by Mr. Murphy." there is something a little dismaying about seeing Mr. Murphy in such a blatantly stereotypical role. In the movies it seems when a white guy wants to commit a crime he hires an available black guy to teach him how to do it. ���Horrible Bosses �۝ in which Jamie Foxx took on the mentor duties at least tried for a hint of protective self-consciousness but that might be too much to ask in this case." though Mr. Murphy�۪s blend of exuberance and hostility is just what ���Tower Heist�۝ needs. Younger viewers who know him only as Dr. Dolittle and the voice of Shrek�۪s sidekick Donkey will catch a glimpse of an earlier more volatile performer and conscientious parents will hasten to add ���48 Hours �۝ ���Trading Places�۝ and the ���Beverly Hills Cop�۝ movies to the Netflix queue." frantic character he played in the ���Night at the Museum�۝ films than to his crazier comic inventions which is a shame. And while we�۪re at it what about Ms. Leoni who was so marvelously and crazily paired with Mr. Stiller in ���Flirting With Disaster�۝? If not for one pretty funny drunken scene you would not know from watching ���Tower Heist�۝ that she is one of the sharpest and most resourceful comic actresses in movies." well. Mediocre entertainment is not a crime ��� this is still America dammit! ��� but ���Tower Heist�۝ could and should have been much more. Mr. Ratner goes for the safe bet and the easy score which means that for all his shows of solidarity with the working stiffs he has more in common with the wealthy scam artist who took their hard-earned money." based on a story by Mr. Griffin Adam Cooper and Bill Collage; director of photography Dante Spinotti; edited by Mark Helfrich; music by Christophe Beck; production design by Kristi Zea; costumes by Sarah Edwards; produced by Brian Grazer Kim Roth and Eddie Murphy; released by Universal Pictures.

Puss is given a tentative romantic interest in the feisty and seductive Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) who first appears in disguise and eventually becomes his sidekick and partner in crime. Kitty�۪s tragedy is that she has been declawed but the movie makes little of it. Despite some perky quasi-flamenco dance numbers their teamwork never quite soars into Astaire-Rogers heaven." at least most of the other transplants from children�۪s stories are indelible. The avaricious Jack and Jill voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris are villainous twangy-voiced old folks who roar around the plains in a covered wagon making trouble. Mother Goose silent except for her fog-horn honk is an ominous Godzilla-size bird who swoops down from on high to protect her golden child whom the outlaw partners have stolen from above." but he is not as memorable a character as Shrek or Shrek�۪s mouthy sidekick Donkey. Consequently the story which involves a quest for magic beans and golden eggs feels improvised and diffuse. The most sharply drawn character Humpty Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis) Puss�۪s erstwhile best friend turned enemy is also the most complex. Jealous and treacherous but with a seed of good he is an animated Rorschach test whose remarkably expressive features register more shades of ambiguity than I can recall encountering in a Hollywood animated character. There are many many egg jokes." where they hatch a dream of acquiring magic beans to grow a beanstalk that they intend to climb into the clouds to steal the Goose That Lays Golden Eggs.

Early in the film you have the sense that this picaresque adventure tale had only the sketchiest of master plans. It is too complex and has too many changes of heart to be a smooth coherent ride. Puss isn�۪t as clear-cut a personality as he was in the ���Shrek�۝ movies. The moral of the story ��� something about revenge and forgiveness ��� simply has little resonance." however there is much to admire. The movie�۪s most remarkable feature is a spectacular use of 3-D that raises the bar for a mainstream animated film.

There�۪s a memorable night scene when Will and Sylvia sprint across a succession of roofs pursued by Raymond the camera racing parallel with the couple the exuberance of their freedom and flight palpable.

�۝ directed by Bruce Robinson (���Withnail and I�۝) and based on an early novel of the same title by Hunter S. Thompson will appeal to anyone who harbors romantic ideas about liquor newspaper journalism or that mythical late-Eisenhower early-Kennedy ���Mad Men�۝ time when the �۪60s were getting ready to happen. Connoisseurs of straw hats and cool sunglasses will find much to savor as will aficionados of guilt-free cigarette smoking and midday boozing." ���The Rum Diary�۝ is also a touching tribute to Thompson himself who committed suicide in 2005. Thompson�۪s alter ego a young writer named Paul Kemp is played by Johnny Depp. This makes the new film a prequel of sorts to Terry Gilliam�۪s ���Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas�۝ (1998) in which Mr. Depp impersonated Thompson in his full Gonzo glory with Hawaiian-print shirts draped over his torso and wild hallucinations sprouting from his balding pate." at least at first glance a more conventional fellow arriving at his new job at an English-language San Juan daily in the grip of a serious hangover but otherwise more presentable than some of his colleagues." shaggy photographer named Bob Sala (Michael Rispoli) and a filthy booze-addled wraith known as Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi). The two of them become Paul�۪s roommates and co-conspirators in a rambling adventure that pits them somewhat woozily against the editor of their newspaper (Richard Jenkins) and a cabal of neocolonialist real estate developers." in that it supplies fans with the chronicle of how a more-or-less ordinary guy transformed himself into a beloved archetype. ���I haven�۪t figured out how to write as myself �۝ Paul says at one point and as he chafes against the requirements of his job and the foul corruption of his environment he is also undergoing the testing ordeal that will ultimately give him a voice and a vocation." a great white sharpie who seems to possess everything Paul desires. Hal a flack for the predatory moneyed interests who want to despoil a pristine island has a luxurious house on the beach a sweet red sports car and a sexy fianc̩e named Chenault (Amber Heard) who seems to have eyes for Paul. Hal also sees Paul as a target for seduction offering him a vaguely defined but apparently crucial role in his lucrative development scheme. Paul�۪s journalistic skills and connections (especially if he�۪s spuriously identified as a correspondent for an important mainland paper) will be an asset." with Hal and Moberg representing opposed cautionary visions of a plausible future. With his talent and looks his good breeding and passable manners Paul could easily sell out and settle into a version of Hal�۪s cushy corrupt existence. Or if his taste for alcohol overtakes him ��� he rates his drinking ���at the higher end of social�۝ ��� he could end up a wasted wreck like his colleague." of course he turns into Hunter S. Thompson an evolution foreshadowed throughout ���The Rum Diary�۝ in ways that will delight Thompson devotees. Sala good-hearted and oddly practical in spite of himself is a prototype of Dr. Gonzo the bulky lawyer who would be Sancho to Thompson�۪s Quixote in ���Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.�۝ Paul�۪s comments as he watches Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy debate on television prefigure both the Nixon hatred that would be one of Thompson�۪s great passions and the mix of prophecy and paranoia that would characterize his political writing. ���The Irishman will win �۝ he predicts. ���But they won�۪t let him live.�۝" get-the-girl ending Kemp locates his ethical center of gravity recovers his chivalrous instincts and reconciles his appetites with his awakening sense of mission. ���What did we take?�۝ he asks after he and Sala have dosed themselves with a powerful and unnamed hallucinogen. ���We�۪ll need to get some more!�۝ Later he declares ���I put the bastards of the world on notice that I do not have their best interests at heart.�۝ Together those statements might stand as a pr̩cis of the vivid and improbable real career that took shape after the fictional events depicted in this film." drawing in his mouth and lowering the register of his voice is reliably unpredictable and predictably cool but as is so often the case lately he seems to be acting from behind the mask of his own charisma. Ms. Heard does what she can to overcome the essentially decorative nature of her part while most of the rest of the cast does whatever mugging or ranting seems appropriate. The exception is Mr. Rispoli whose sweaty anxious geniality is the most interesting and authentic thing in the movie.

A city develops organically through the complex interplay of economics biology and countless local individual decisions but also by means of planning on the part of architects engineers and politicians." to some extent the deep subject of ���Urbanized �۝ Gary Hustwit�۪s fascinating idea-packed new documentary. In this remarkably concise film ��� which could easily have sprawled to 15 hours on public television ��� Mr. Hustwit and his crew survey both the challenges and promises facing some of the world�۪s important cities. Their itinerary may not take them everywhere you want it to but it also turns up some unexpected vistas along with familiar ones." yes and New York (looking especially gorgeous in the movie�۪s final shot) and here are the slums of Mumbai and the beaches of Rio de Janeiro. But have you heard about the bike lanes of Bogot�� Colombia? About the walkways threaded through the townships on the outskirts of Cape Town? About the new housing projects that are replacing the informal settlements in Santiago Chile?" but even viewers with deep knowledge of modern urban planning are likely to learn something from the carefully selected images and thoughtful interviews that make up most of ���Urbanized.�۝ This is the third film in Mr. Hustwit�۪s trilogy of documentaries on the role of design in the modern world and it can be thought of as the conceptual shell that contains the other two. The first ���Helvetica �۝ is about the shape of the printed word and in particular the font named in the title. ���Objectified�۝ concerns itself with the shape and packaging of the things we buy sell and carry. In both cases a phenomenon likely to be taken for granted is shown to have a complex back story a set of often unexamined reasons for being the way it is." notably climate change and population growth. This slant leaves some inevitable gaps ��� the David-and-Goliath battle between Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs is mentioned but important earlier figures like Daniel Burnham and Frederick Law Olmsted are not ��� and there is a distinct bias in favor of Jacobs-influenced new urbanism and against other approaches to city planning." but the prevailing argument in ���Urbanized�۝ is that these cities are examples of how to do it wrong. The Brazilian capital is seen as a monument of modernist arrogance while Phoenix represents soul-killing standardization and the reckless overconsumption of carbon-based fuel. Against these follies the case is made for pedestrian-friendly metropolitan cores bicycle lanes and an ethic that combines the knowledge of experts with the desires and innovations of local residents." but that is in keeping with the overall mood of the film which is lively curious and pedagogical. Like a really good class taught by a team of enthusiastic professors ���Urbanized�۝ supplies grist for many late-night arguments or solitary ruminations.

�۝ a costume spectacle directed by Roland Emmerich from a script by John Orloff is a vulgar prank on the English literary tradition a travesty of British history and a brutal insult to the human imagination. Apart from that it�۪s not bad." 17th Earl of Oxford. This notion sometimes granted the unwarranted dignity of being called a theory is hardly new. It represents a hoary form of literary birtherism that has persisted for a century or so in happy defiance of reason and evidence. The arrival of ���Anonymous�۝ has roused Shakespeareans more learned than I to the weary task of re-debunking ��� in the past two weeks The New York Times has published both an Op-Ed piece and a Sunday magazine Riff opposing the Oxfordian position ��� and to their cogent arguments I can offer only a small corrective. This is a Roland Emmerich film. (At least I assume it is though I guess in the spirit of the enterprise I should be open to other possibilities. Joe Swanberg? Brett Ratner? Zhang Yimou? It all seems eerily plausible once you start to think about it.)" 000 B.C.�۝ ��� to mention only the most salient example ��� should be taken as a reliable guide to history. Perhaps he and Mr. Orloff (���Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga�۪Hoole�۝) rather than advancing the case for Edward de Vere set out to undermine it by exposing the absurd prejudices and fallacies on which the hypothesis rests. These can be boiled down to a sentimental and reactionary fantasy of class. How could Shakespeare the half-educated son of an unlettered provincial glove maker have written all those masterpieces? Surely it is more plausible to suppose that they were the work of one of his betters." and it is amusing to watch Rafe Spall turn his Shakespeare into a shallow duplicitous fraud (not to mention a whoremonger a blackmailer and a murderer). Rhys Ifans who plays the Earl of Oxford is a touching picture of aristocratic melancholy his long face and hooded eyes suggesting the weariness of a decent disappointed soul. The poor Earl prevented by family circumstances from pursuing his literary dreams has spent a lifetime quilling up secret masterpieces about gloomy Danish princes midsummer night�۪s dreams and other curious subjects." poutily and prettily by Jamie Campbell Bower) Edward presented his pieces at court where they delighted the young Queen Elizabeth I (Joely Richardson) so much that she went to bed with him. Later when she has aged into a regal Vanessa Redgrave (Ms. Richardson�۪s mother) she will be so worked up by a ���Shakespearean�۝ performance that she will be compelled to undo the buttons of her bodice." and they will take to the streets against an actual hunchback (Sir Robert Cecil played by Edward Hogg. David Thewlis is Sir Robert�۪s equally sinister father William Elizabeth�۪s most trusted and least trustworthy adviser as well as de Vere�۪s father-in-law)." �۝ ���Richard III�۝) to assert some behind-the-scenes influence over the affairs of state. ���Anonymous�۝ gives him complicated reasons for wanting to keep King James of Scotland off the English throne once Elizabeth is gone and to sustain the Tudor line by promoting the ascendance of the Earl of Southampton (Xavier Samuel). The Earl of Southampton is a close friend of the Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) to whom de Vere is close for reasons that may shock you or else reduce you to incredulous giggling." �۝ Edward de Vere insists and ���Anonymous�۝ proposes as a corollary that only political players can produce theater of real consequence. A mere professional like Shakespeare or his colleague and sometime rival Ben Jonson could never dream of committing masterpieces like ���King Lear�۝ or ���Macbeth.�۝ Only an inspired noble amateur could achieve such greatness. The history of English letters refutes this notion at almost every turn ��� there are far more hacks than gentlemen to be found in the canon ��� and it seems disingenuous for Hollywood hacks to be endorsing it." the show-business professionalism that ���Anonymous�۝ goes to such great lengths to disdain turns out to be its saving virtue. As a work of serious history it is beyond useless. You would never know that Ben Jonson played with thick-tongued mopiness by Sebastian Armesto was a great comic writer nor that Elizabeth was a shrewd and ruthless political operator as opposed to the dreamy dithering mooncalf depicted here. (Don�۪t get me started on poor Christopher Marlowe.) And yet there is no reason to deny Mr. Emmerich and Mr. Orloff the liberties that Shakespeare himself ��� and I do mean Shakespeare the commercial entertainer not some sad peer of the realm ��� was so free in taking." as I said before that it is in many ways not bad. Mr. Orloff�۪s puffed-up dialogue is enlivened by infusions of actual Shakespeare some of it performed by Mark Rylance one of Shakespeare�۪s leading modern interpreters. (It is by contrast a little depressing to see another Derek Jacobi lending his imprimatur to this folly in the role of a present-day narrator). The production design (by Sebastian T. Krawinkel) and the costumes (by Lisy Christl) are superb blending with Anna J. Foerster�۪s dark and rich cinematography to produce a plausibly Elizabethan atmosphere with interiors that often look like Holbein paintings." but good ones can burnish even meretricious nonsense with craft and conviction. And so it is here. Ms. Redgrave and Mr. Ifans are so full of feeling Mr. Thewlis and Mr. Hogg are so full of bile and fanaticism and Mr. Spall is so full of baloney that you are tempted to suspend disbelief even if Mr. Emmerich finally makes it impossible." bodice ripping bawdy speech and the cold-blooded murder of the truth."

an intrepid social worker from Nottingham England who exposed shameful national crimes. As recently as 1967 but especially in the 1940s and �۪50s as many as 130 000 children were removed from orphanages and group homes in Britain and deported to various locations in the Commonwealth particularly western Australia. One deportee now grown up recalls being told at the age of 10 that he was being sent to a sunny paradise where he could pick oranges off trees." many found themselves virtually enslaved and forced into hard labor in institutions where they endured physical cruelty and sexual abuse. One of the worst was the remote Bindoon Boys Town a hellish place presided over by the Catholic Christian Brothers where many boys were raped." who were told that their parents were dead had no recourse but to endure until they were old enough to leave. Many were taken from parents mainly unwed mothers temporarily deemed unfit. When they later searched for their offspring in orphanages they were told their children had been placed for adoption in better homes." adapted from Ms. Humphreys�۪s 1994 book ���Empty Cradles �۝ tells a true-life horror story it refrains from exploiting that story for cheap shock. As directed by Jim Loach the son of the great social realist filmmaker Ken Loach it keeps its eye on the long view and maintains a steady melancholic tone that conveys a resolute moral outrage." but the hostility she encounters in her investigations isn�۪t overamplified. Nor is Ms. Watson�۪s Margaret a charismatic Joan of Arc leading a righteous brigade into the bowels of hell." who is assisted by her husband Merv (Richard Dillane) is a fragile lone wolf who sacrifices the comforts of family life to pursue her work and eventually crumbles under the stress yet keeps on going. In Ms. Watson�۪s powerfully understated performance there are occasional speeches but no stentorian orations. Her cause is the only thing that matters.

The film devotes special attention to Len (David Wenham) a high-strung former resident of Bindoon who persuades her to accompany him on a visit to the place." the film often loses track of time and becomes fragmented as it struggles to integrate too many subplots.

hard-working souls have been demonized and caricatured. Surely the much-reviled 1 percent does not consist of plutocrats in top hats or predators in blue suits but of human beings just like the other 99 percent of us albeit with more money and perhaps more to answer for." in a way is the message of J. C. Chandor�۪s ���Margin Call �۝ which does a great deal to humanize the authors ��� and beneficiaries ��� of the 2008 financial crisis. But the film relentless in its honesty and shrewd in its insights and techniques is unlikely to soothe the wounded pride of the actual or aspiring ruling class. It is a tale of greed vanity myopia and expediency that is all the more damning for its refusal to moralize." no operatic speeches condemning or celebrating greed. Just a bunch of guys (and one woman Demi Moore) in well-tailored clothes and a state of quiet panic trying to save themselves from a global catastrophe of their own making. Watching them going about their business you don�۪t feel the kind of fury inspired by ���Inside Job �۝ Charles Ferguson�۪s great muckraking documentary on the origins of the financial crisis but rather a mix of dread disgust pity and confusion." above all admiration for an extraordinary feat of filmmaking. It is hard to believe that ���Margin Call�۝ is Mr. Chandor�۪s first feature. His formal command ��� his ability to imply far more than he shows or says and to orchestrate a large complex drama out of whispers glances and snippets of jargon ��� is downright awe inspiring. The movie rarely leaves the Manhattan offices of the fictional investment bank (loosely modeled on Lehman Brothers) in which it takes place and limits its action which consists mainly of phone calls and hurried meetings to a frenzied 24-hour period. Within that narrow frame the gears of a complex narrative mesh with ravishing clockwork precision." moving through ambient shadows to the anxious tempo of Nathan Larson�۪s hushed anxious score. It is also a horror movie with disaster lurking like an unseen demon outside the skyscraper windows and behind the computer screens. It is also a workplace comedy of sorts. The crackling syncopated dialogue and the plot full of reversals and double crosses owe an obvious debt to David Mamet�۪s profane fables of deal-making machismo. Hovering over all of it is the dark romance of capital: the elegance of numbers; the kinkiness of money; the deep rotten erotic allure of power." no one is innocent either. A young risk analyst named Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) may be as close as the movie comes to a hero but it is also possible to see what happens to him as a parable of how the system corrupts and exploits its most decent and honest minions. Working late one night Peter (who we later learn has a Ph.D. in physics) glimpses a sign of the apocalypse lurking in a mathematical model. Recent volatility in the market is threatening the stability of the mortgage-based securities that have been generating most of the company�۪s profits and the resulting losses are likely to swallow this bank and make trillions of dollars vanish into thin air." once again what occurred in 2008 ��� though a comparison with the journalistic records suggests that ���Margin Call�۝ is broadly accurate ��� but rather to explore the psychological pressures and ethical choices at work among those who caught an early glimpse of the abyss and then helped push everyone else into it." Will Emerson a cynical soldier played by Paul Bettany. In a gangster movie Will would be the midlevel enforcer entrusted with the dirty work but denied real authority. His superior is Sam Rogers played by a splendidly world-weary Kevin Spacey. Sam oversees the sales force that has been peddling the bad securities and he must now carry the bad news upstairs through several more layers of company hierarchy." who seems to have promoted the scheme that is now unraveling and who may have ignored warnings about its outcome. Eventually word of what Peter has learned reaches John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) the charming dapper black-hearted boss of bosses who arrives by helicopter in the dead of night like a vampire summoned from the crypt." the less he is likely to understand what the firm is actually doing. This ignorance is almost a point of pride. ���I don�۪t get any of this stuff�۝ ��� this line is repeated about Peter�۪s discovery by Will then Sam then Sam�۪s boss Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and then Tuld. In a further absurdity one person who does get it Peter�۪s mentor Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) has just been downsized out of the company. As a security measure his cellphone has been disconnected which means that his increasingly desperate former colleagues are unable to find him when he might be of most use." and a survival plan worked out. The consequences are acknowledged ��� those we are living with now ��� and then coldly accepted in the name of a vaporous greater good. ���We have no choice.�۝ ���There is no choice.�۝ ���It�۪s not like we have a choice.�۝ These phrases are uttered again and again by people who truly believe what they are saying. Some of them may have sleepless nights ahead but none are likely to suffer very terribly. The accomplishment of this movie is that it allows you to sympathize with them to acknowledge the reality of their predicament without letting them off the hook or forgetting the damage they did."

Figuring that we already know something about how harsh life can be he reminds us of its modest charms and fleeting beauties and of how easy it is in the face of cruelty to behave decently." in particular to a half-imaginary half-vanished realm of proletarian Frenchness incarnated in the films and popular music of the first half of the 20th century. It is no coincidence that one of its characters (played by the Finnish actress Kati Outinen a fixture of Mr. Kaurismaki�۪s universe) is named Arletty after the singer and actress who embodied the spirit and pathos of the Gallic working class in the 1930s and �۪40s." a colleague of Tati�۪s and an important comic filmmaker in his own right whose work has recently enjoyed something of a revival.

���Martha Marcy May Marlene�۝ is a story of fractured identity in which a young woman tries to negotiate incompatible versions of herself all the while wondering who she really is. The film Sean Durkin�۪s impressively self-assured debut feature switches back and forth between two periods in its protagonist�۪s life ��� an indeterminate span when she is part of a cult in rural New York and the time just after her escape from the group when she has found refuge with her older sister and brother-in-law in their rented lakeside vacation house." though she does not necessarily know her very well. The leader of the cult who claims spiritual and physical intimacy with all his followers has christened her Marcy May. (Marlene is the all-purpose pseudonym female cult members use when answering the telephone.)" and whatever her mood ��� it ranges from vaguely unsettled to acutely anguished ��� Martha is played by Elizabeth Olsen a very pretty actress whose on-camera presence is at once vivid and interestingly blurred. Her features seem to shift appearing sharp from some angles and soft from others and her body can look alternately sturdy and frail depending on the circumstances." ���Martha Marcy May Marlene�۝ is in part a psychological case study of someone whose inner life is permanently out of reach if it even exists at all." Lucy (Sarah Paulson) have some family unhappiness behind them but we never learn precisely what happened between them or to their parents. Nor do we know what drew Martha into the thrall of Patrick the Svengali of an agrarian sex commune whose sun-dappled fields and lithe young bodies suggest a spiritually ambitious Abercrombie & Fitch catalog. But it is clear that her passivity and uncertainty make her perfect prey for Patrick and his group." with fatherly affection and an occasional rebuke from Patrick who is played with sinewy sinister charisma by John Hawkes. Gradually an uglier side of his community emerges and it starts to look less like a progressive summer camp than a new incarnation of the Manson family. Female acolytes are initiated into the group by being drugged and raped by the leader and the most disturbing scenes show Martha undergoing this ordeal and then later preparing a new recruit for it." Ted (Hugh Dancy) has its own difficulties and Martha�۪s disgust at what she sees as their shallow materialistic sham of normalcy suggests that she has held onto some of Patrick�۪s teachings even after fleeing his world.

The narrative structure switching back and forth between Patrick�۪s utopia and Lucy and Ted�۪s middle-class dream creates a sense of symmetry or even equivalence between the two places.

teacher social critic guru without portfolio ��� whose name was once a household word and whose books were talismans of intellectual seriousness and social concern. His current obscurity is something this documentary directed by Jonathan Lee and including eloquent testimony from friends family and admirers is determined to overcome." �۝ says Jerl Surratt who attended Goodman�۪s memorial service in 1972 despite never having met him. He is referring to the style and substance of Goodman�۪s remarkably eclectic body of work and underscoring a point implicit in the rest of Mr. Lee�۪s film. The time is surely right for a Goodman revival. There are aspects of contemporary life that he anticipated and influenced ��� the gay rights movement most notably ��� and others that are sorely in need of his wisdom. At a time when the discussion of education is locked into sterile strident and instrumental debates about ���reform �۝ his radical humanism at once romantic and commonsensical would be more than welcome." ���Growing Up Absurd �۝ originally commissioned as a study of juvenile delinquency and later a bible of the 1960s student rebellion remains essential and troubling reading for anyone who cares about the problems of the young which were hardly solved by the baby boomers. Libertarians and anarchists of the left and the right could learn a lot from this Jeffersonian pacifist�۪s ideas about freedom. And those drawn to the recent renewal of interest in artisanal and agrarian practices as a sustainable alternative to consumerism will find instruction and inspiration in ���Communitas �۝ a 1947 blueprint for utopia that Mr. Goodman wrote with his brother Percival." polymathic thinking is not much in fashion these days but perhaps that should change too. In any case Mr. Lee�۪s film in addition to making a persuasive (if partial) case for its subject�۪s importance also has a great story to tell of a 20th-century life that was at once exemplary and idiosyncratic." born in 1911 belonged to a generation of Jewish intellectuals who made their way from the margins to the center of American cultural life. Educated in the argumentative pressure cooker of City College in the �۪30s he avoided the lures of ideological sectarianism. A writer of varied interests and talents ��� his poetry stands up particularly well ��� he followed a zigzagging career path. He was a founder of Gestalt therapy and a member of the faculty of Black Mountain College in North Carolina a midcentury hotbed of the homegrown avant-garde." he was open and unapologetic about his sexual attraction to men. Nobody interviewed in ���Paul Goodman Changed My Life�۝ suggests that he was an easy person to understand or to get along with but a composite portrait emerges of a man who never stopped thinking and who was incapable of anything but honesty in thought and deed. As a result he sometimes alienated allies and exasperated friends." though any hurt feelings he left behind seem to have healed and while a more pointed and skeptical treatment of his life and work might have been possible Mr. Lee allows himself to be guided by an affectionate generous spirit consistent with Goodman�۪s best qualities. At times especially early on as it makes its introductions his film has the reverent air of a funeral service with sentiment threatening to overshadow ideas. In the end though the ideas receive a full hearing in 90 minutes a span Goodman himself might have found intolerably brief." and not only because it approves so unreservedly of him. ���Paul Goodman Changed My Life�۝ may not have that effect on every viewer but it has a passionate almost prophetic sense of the impact that a writer and thinker can have on his times and the future."

�۝ when Robert Ledgard a plastic surgeon and madman played with soul weariness by Antonio Banderas gazes at the image of a woman on the wall of his bedroom. She�۪s bigger than life this woman and more beautiful. He calls her Vera (Elena Anaya) and she�۪s stretched out in the classic recumbent pose of the odalisque: that exotic Turkish harem dweller and Orientalist fantasy painted by the likes of Goya Ingres and  Manet and given opulent new life and reverberant meaning by Mr. Almod�_var a master of his art." the often naked women lie across the image like unwrapped gifts exquisitely available to the men who paint them and to the patrons who value such female voluptuaries. There�۪s something different about Vera though it�۪s initially difficult to pinpoint what. Ledgard lives in a mansion brightened with paintings of big nudes and blooms and when you first see him looking at Vera it�۪s as if he were viewing another canvas or a photo or peering into a window. Yet this is no ordinary image; rather it�۪s a surveillance video and Vera has just tried to kill herself. Ledgard won�۪t stand for that and rushes in to save her patching up a body that�۪s the centerpiece in an intoxicating lush mystery." �۝ which might also be described as an existential mystery a melodramatic thriller a medical horror film or just a polymorphous extravaganza. In other words it�۪s an Almod�_var movie with all the attendant gifts that implies: lapidary technique calculated perversity intelligent wit. There�۪s also beauty and spectacle of course especially as embodied by Vera who usually wears a body stocking with gloves and booties and knows exactly what she looks like. Watch how she watches Ledgard watching her a relay of looks that evokes John Berger�۪s observation: ���Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at.�۝ Were we born this way or made? Mr. Almod�_var has his ideas which he playfully explores with each labyrinthine turn." dark funny and fractured even jagged. It opens on a cityscape and the dateline ���Toledo 2012�۝ (as in Spain not Ohio) the first indication that we�۪re not in Kansas anymore. It�۪s a shivery intimation of a futureworld but it�۪s followed by a nod to ���Citizen Kane�۝ as the camera glides past a gate and into an isolated mansion. There Vera lives in a bright locked room with a Spartan-modernist ambience where she does little else except watch nature TV practice yoga scribble on the walls and create little busts inspired by the biomorphic forms of Louise Bourgeois. Ledgard calls her his patient though she would rightly call herself his prisoner as well as the object of his obsession." quickly draping a shadow across half a face for instance a bifurcation that suggests both a divided self and a yin-yang symbol. Mostly he plunges you straight into a story that moves restlessly at times imperceptibly between the present and past. As in ���Vertigo�۝ (another of this film�۪s touchstones) the past and present exist in a loop at least for a man obsessed. Eventually the galvanizing points on that time continuum come into focus including an accident that badly burned Ledgard�۪s wife prompting his search for a new type of skin." your grip may not be secure) though it�۪s instantly clear that something is jumping beneath the surface here threatening to burst forth. Vera�۪s plight and the temporal shifts help create an air of unease and barely controlled chaos an unsettling vibe that becomes spooky when Ledgard puts on a white lab coat and begins doing strange things with blood. Mr. Almod�_var doesn�۪t paint the screen red at least not right away. Instead he daubs it on the crimson easing in by way of the curtains Ledgard lectures in front of and in the droplets he perfectly places on glass plates. Later the blood will splash across a white bed in a frenzy of violence an Abstract Expressionist splatter." as complication is piled onto complication and new characters and intrigues are introduced amid horror melodrama and slapstick. ���You�۪re insane!�۝ a colleague tells Ledgard who doesn�۪t look terribly surprised by the news. Later a rapist Zeca (Roberto ́lamo) in a tiger suit rings the doorbell and one fateful night Ledgard�۪s daughter Norma (Blanca Suarez) meets a young man Vicente (Jan Cornet). Despite all these moving spinning parts Mr. Almod�_var�۪s control remains virtuosic and the film hangs together completely secured by Vera and Ledgard and a relationship that�۪s a Pandora�۪s box from which identity gender sex and desire spring." though neither has been directed to seduce like some of the director�۪s past memorable characters. (A spikily human funny Marisa Paredes as Ledgard�۪s fanatically loyal housekeeper Marilia supplies plenty of warmth.) For good story reasons Vera is largely opaque while Ledgard remains at arm�۪s length: She is a question that he�۪s asked but at first can�۪t answer." in particular to Mr. Banderas as this likable if often misused actor goes dark without compromising his character with softness or light.

For the first half-hour or so it works a little too hard goosing (sorry!) the proceedings with jaunty music smirky comedy and action sequences that turn the contemplation of natural beauty into a frenzied stampede of oddballs." ���The Big Year�۝ rewards patience. It respects both the integrity and the eccentricity of the avian obsession and it communicates something of the fascinating abundance and weirdness of the animals themselves. Some of the film�۪s feathered specimens it�۪s true have been concocted digitally but the appeal of hunting down and visually grazing on the various birds of America is clear enough even though the movie may not compel you to go out and try it. Birds are evidence of the miraculous and protean work of evolution and more important emblems of wildness in an overcivilized world. ���Hope is the thing with feathers �۝ Emily Dickinson wrote." Kenny Bostick and Stu Preissler. Each one for his own reasons is trying to do a big year to attain the summit of the birding subculture by logging more sightings than anyone else. Bostick (Mr. Wilson) is the reigning champion an arrogant competitor who is admired and resented in equal measure the way the New York Yankees are or the Dallas Cowboys used to be. He will stop at nothing to be the best. We learn that his insatiable ambition has already destroyed at least one marriage and as the year unfolds it threatens another (to a woman named Jessica portrayed by Rosamund Pike)." who have earthbound cares of their own. Stu about to become a grandfather for the first time is trying to retire from his position at the head of a big company but he keeps being dragged in for important meetings. If Stu is a prisoner of his own success Brad lives in a cloud of failure: 36 and divorced he lives with his parents (Dianne Wiest and Brian Dennehy) and works at a crummy job. He is the typical Jack Black underachiever ��� he could be Lemuel Gulliver Po the Kung Fu Panda or Dewey Finn in ���School of Rock�۝ ��� motivated by dreams that seem quixotic until they start to come true." rides a bicycle paddles a canoe etc. ��� the comedy of ���The Big Year�۝ is gentle and low key. Mr. Frankel and the screenwriter the Hollywood veteran Howard Franklin who adapted Mark Obmascik�۪s book poke fun at the foibles of the birding tribe but they avoid easy mean caricatures. (The film�۪s single instance of cruelty is reserved for the nonbirding member of a pair of newlyweds on an ill-starred honeymoon.) Tim Blake Nelson with a mustache and a curious accent stands out from the flock as does the versatile and consistently delightful Rashida Jones who becomes Brad�۪s crush object." and their absence from the big-year contestants is notable and a bit puzzling. Until you realize that birding is to this movie what sports war crime police work and superheroing are to 90 percent of the other recent Hollywood movies you can name ��� an arena where men grapple with their identity crises and women function as spectators coaches and trophies." since what ���The Big Year�۝ does best is take note of the contrasting ways birding intersects with the lives of its protagonists. Squinting through binoculars or tiptoeing through underbrush may look the same each time but its meaning changes depending on the motives and desires of the birder." birding is a vocation the thing that gives him a sense of purpose and a shot at greatness. It also drives him away from everything else and that is what separates him from Stu and Brad for whom the activity is both an end in itself and a means of reconnecting with other more important parts of life.

and nobody can stop the American film industry from making movies about people who try. The most impressive thing about Craig Brewer�۪s remake of ���Footloose�۝ ��� the 1984 Kevin Bacon movie with the Kenny Loggins theme song that will now be stuck in my cranium for another 27 years ��� is that it handles its shaky shopworn premise with sensitivity and conviction." Ga. have banned dancing (and loud music and a lot of other fun) not out of prudery but as a result of misguided but understandable parental concern. After a wild night drinking beer and shaking their blue-jeaned tailfeathers to Blake Shelton�۪s new version of the theme song a group of local teenagers were killed in a road accident. Among them was the only son of the Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) who also has a daughter named Ariel (Julianne Hough)." Ariel is a high school senior running wild with a local racecar driver (Patrick John Flueger) and the town�۪s young people are sitting still and being quiet under the watchful eyes of the authorities occasionally sneaking out for some clandestine toe tapping. Into this scene comes Ren (Kenny Wormald) who moves from the notoriously dance-crazy city of Boston to live with his uncle and aunt." �۝ you know more or less what happens and you may find some of the alterations amusing. Instead of a game of chicken on tractors for instance there is a dirt-track race involving modified school buses. Mr. Brewer films this lumbering action sequence and several brawls and fights with more verve and relish than he brings to the dance numbers which are in the age of ���Glee �۝ the ���High School Musical�۝ movies and the mighty ���Step Up�۝ franchise woefully inadequate." and while he may be in possession of what are technically known as ���moves �۝ his dancing lacks sensuality and a sense of release. Much better is Miles Teller as Willard Ren�۪s drawling sidekick ��� Mater to his Lightning McQueen if you�۪ll permit a ���Cars�۝ reference. With his scarecrow limbs and slack features Mr. Teller has a natural charisma that is both comic and kind of sexy." but Mr. Brewer�۪s expertise ��� as shown in his previous films ���Hustle & Flow�۝ and ���Black Snake Moan�۝ ��� lies in pulpy vulgarity and florid melodrama. These elements certainly have a place in this movie as does the director�۪s evident affection for the music and idioms of the South. Apart from the inevitable �۪80s-throwback and popped-up hip-hop tracks the music in this ���Footloose�۝ is better and more eclectic than the original with some blues country and vintage metal mixed in with the peppy dance tunes." a pop confection like this needs just the right mix of silliness and sincerity so that you believe both that a lot is at stake in the battle over dancing and that in the end it�۪s really just dancing. Somehow ���Footloose�۝ never finds its rhythm. The maudlin scenes drag on and the livelier moments pass by too quickly. It only works when it settles down and lets the characters (and the audience) hang out and have a little fun. Which is all kids really want to do.

�۝ a family melodrama about coming to terms with your parents (they�۪re people too as it turns out) weighs in as such an innocuous appeal to the heart that it hardly seems deserving of the critical lash. The familiarity of its milieu its characters and their hurts and grievances recall any number of other movies. What�۪s striking about this one though is how its predictability can seem like a hedge or maybe a defense against the very possibility of surprise." Michael (a wan Ryan Reynolds) a writer starts up the stairs in his family�۪s Midwestern home. As he begins his ascent there is a cutaway to his left hand with its wedding ring. The trouble is you�۪ve already seen him unsmilingly slip the ring on in a previous scene while he�۪s en route on a plane. A few beats later a fan asks him to sign one of his books and he purposely writes over its dedication (���For Kelly�۝) pressing into the paper as he obliterates the name and broadcasts his feelings. So why that second shot of his finger? It�۪s unlikely anyone watching forgot about it or his grimacing." in his feature debut the writer and director Dennis Lee (or his producers) doesn�۪t trust his storytelling or the audience. Repetition can be a useful strategy a way of focusing attention on themes and motifs. The use of eye and bird imagery in ���Psycho �۝ for instance adds uncanny notes and suggests that one may do in or rather peck out the other. And in ���Moneyball �۝ bookending shots of Brad Pitt on an empty baseball field convey that his character begins and ends as a man alone. By contrast the shot of Michael�۪s hand only affirms the little that was so studiously laid out in another scene minutes earlier: that he�۪s conflicted about his marriage reluctant to announce those feelings or both. It says nothing." it discloses that nothing new and surprising will happen scene to scene despite characters who do plenty of talking explaining and telegraphing. When Michael returns home he arrives in the midst of a fresh family tragedy. The story then toggles between the family�۪s present-tense strained relationships (Emily Watson plays his young aunt) and Michael�۪s memories of his unhappy childhood with his brutish father Charles (Willem Dafoe) and loving mother Lisa (Julia Roberts). Mr. Dafoe and Ms. Roberts are serviceable if awkwardly matched and his bad-dad lines can be risible. The idea that these two could have spawned Mr. Reynolds is temporarily distracting as is Carrie-Anne Moss in a fitted black dress swooping in as yes Kelly." and it�۪s pretty in a soothing glossy commercial-advertising way (it was shot by Danny Moder Ms. Roberts�۪s husband) with aerial images of green vistas that convey that this is a world of growth. Despite a few harsh outbursts from Ms. Watson who can rage like a Fury the film lacks urgency and discovery partly because the psychology emotions and words feel already processed rather than newly revealed. Like too many other similar American independent films about families and their dealing and healing it turns the profundities of human life ��� the heaviness and lightness of love the epiphanies disappointments pleasures sorrows bliss-outs and losses ��� into teachable moments. Mr. Lee gathers together a lifetime of hurt without conveying that there�۪s something personal at stake."

Running time: 1 hour 20 minutes. This film is not rated." 1935 The New York Times published a statement by Varian Fry in which that young American the editor of Living Age magazine described anti-Jewish rioting that had taken place in Berlin two nights earlier.

After the rioting Fry had visited Ernst Franz Sedgwick Hanfstaengl then a Hitler press adviser. Hanfstaengl and Fry were Harvard men which may help to explain why the adviser was so free with his words. He told Fry that it had been storm troopers not Jews who had hissed a Swedish film heckling that had been blamed for causing the rioting. (Fry didn�۪t identify the film but it was the anti-Semitic comedy ���Pettersson & Bendel �۝ which was released in Germany in July 1935 and according to Rochelle Wright�۪s book on Swedish film ���The Visible Wall �۝ was seen by Hitler as a propaganda tool.)" with breathtaking casualness Hanfstaengl painted during their meeting. ���Mr. Fry �۝ the article stated ���said that in his talk with Mr. Hanfstaengl he was told that there were two anti-Semitic groups one the radical section that desired to solve the Jewish question with bloodshed and the other a moderate group that wished to segregate the Jews by law into a specified area.�۝" called Putzi graduated from Harvard in 1909 while Fry graduated in 1931.)

the French boulevard comedy ���The Women on the 6th Floor�۝ was designed for the gentle laughter it easily earns. Set in 1962 Paris the story involves a seemingly hopeless staid bourgeois businessman whose entire existence ��� family career sense of purpose and patrimony ��� is overturned after he discovers another happier world with a group of Spanish maids living in his family�۪s building. As in Henri Murger�۪s classic ���Sc̬nes de la Vie de Boh̬me�۝ (and in the Puccini opera) redemption is just a garret away." Jean-Louis Joubert (a great Fabrice Luchini) seems too embedded in his routine to kick-start a story much less his life. He and his chilly wife Suzanne (Sandrine Kiberlain) live in a cavernous apartment in the huge building where he his parents and grandparents were all born and where his recently not altogether dearly departed mother reigned supreme. (The couple�۪s two young sons are at boarding school if not for long.)" Suzanne is trying to redo the apartment to her taste against the vigorous protests of the family�۪s longtime maid Germaine (Mich̬le Gleizer). For Germaine any change is an affront to the mother�۪s memory though Suzanne claims she only wants a maison of her own." it�۪s hard to say and Suzanne hires a replacement Mar�_a (Natalia Verbeke). She�۪s a pretty young Spaniard newly arrived whose Aunt Concepci�_n (Carmen Maura) lives in one of the tiny rooms rented by some Spanish maids on the top floor of the Jouberts�۪ building. The director Philippe Le Guay lays out these pieces ��� Jean-Louis�۪s gentility Suzanne�۪s hauteur Mar�_a�۪s beauty and Suzanne�۪s decision to bring this beauty home ��� into place effortlessly shamelessly and then swerves. Instead of simply falling for Mar�_a Jean-Louis becomes smitten with all the maids along with their culture food and friendship. A little paella and acts of kindness later and he�۪s nestled in their arms and maternal bosoms." real often well-padded bosoms and you begin to understand how heavily ��� and dubiously ��� Mr. Le Guay who wrote the script with J̩r̫me Tonnerre stacks the narrative deck. With fearless or unconscious disregard for clich̩s about the putative exoticism of other cultures Mr. Le Guay sets Jean-Louis on an apparently indefensible course: The rich French businessman abandons his cosseted life and finds himself amid the struggling smiling Spanish domestics. It sounds like the sort of class fantasy that might land the film in Marxist jail if it weren�۪t so drolly absurd and if Jean-Louis didn�۪t seem a bit mad perhaps as the film suggests from all the years he has spent maintaining his respectable bourgeois pose. Certainly poor Suzanne confesses to being exhausted even with the pampering." Suzanne isn�۪t treated with the generosity she deserves by the filmmakers who almost predictably make her a sexist caricature: the frivolous wealthy sexually withholding woman who of course compares badly with her hard-scrubbing sensual maid. Ms. Verbeke is pretty and appealing but somewhat tellingly Mar�_a is by comparison a blur. More charitably Jean-Louis comes across as a child of circumstance who became a man of property and then its prisoner and then something else altogether. He should have been insufferable and intentionally or not he�۪s not entirely likable and even little creepy which makes him more interesting. Mr. Luchini with his caught-in-the-headlights stare and a toothy smile that seems welcoming and worried ensures that he�۪s irresistible." ���The Women on the 6th Floor�۝ more truly takes place in movieland. Despite the peeling walls in the maids�۪ quarters and a few other unpleasantnesses the film is grounded in fantasy life�۪s harsher truths having been gently rounded off. On Mar�_a�۪s first day at the Jouberts�۪ she doesn�۪t break into a sweat; rather she and the other Spanish maids who have come to help shimmy and shake around like Disney�۪s Snow White whistling or really just cha-cha-cha-ing while they work.

the governor of Pennsylvania in ���The Ides of March �۝ is an image of the liberal heart�۪s desire and not only because he is played by George Clooney. Morris who keeps his cool while inflaming the passions of Democratic primary voters is a committed environmentalist and a forthright secularist who sidesteps questions about his faith by professing that his religion is the United States Constitution. He is against war and in favor of jobs though the economy figures much less in his fictitious campaign than it will in the real one just around the corner." while watching Morris in action to substitute a different set of talking points and imagine the governor as a Republican dream candidate smoothly defending low taxes and traditional values in the same seductive whisper. (Who is the right-wing George Clooney? Is Tom Selleck still available?)" really to connect this fable to the world it pretends to represent. Whatever happens in 2012 within either party or in the contest between them it seems fair to say that quite a lot will be at stake. That is not the case in ���The Ides of March �۝ which is less an allegory of the American political process than a busy foggy mildly entertaining antidote to it." locked in a battle for the nomination with a colorless (and barely seen) Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell) is a bit of a cipher or perhaps a symbol. He stands for an ideal of political charisma that the film directed by Mr. Clooney and based on the play ���Farragut North�۝ by Beau Willimon sets out to tarnish. And yet it seems doubtful after more than a decade of scandal acrimony and bare-knuckled media brawling that this noble fantasy exists anywhere but in the minds of writers and actors who look back fondly on the glorious make-believe administrations of Henry Fonda and Martin Sheen." you get jaded and cynical �۝ one campaign staffer says to another. ���The Ides of March�۝ sets out first to rebut this bit of conventional wisdom then to reaffirm it. It is in large part the tale of a professional politico�۪s loss of innocence. Not Morris�۪s but that of Stephen Meyers a young hotshot on the governor�۪s campaign staff who is played with sad-eyed intensity by Ryan Gosling. His prodigious talents are mentioned rather than shown but we can accept that he is both a dazzling tactical brain and what�۪s more a true believer working for Morris because he thinks Morris is the last best hope for America." whose counterpart in the Pullman campaign is Tom Duffy played by Paul Giamatti. ���The Ides of March�۝ feels most alive and truest to its ostensible subject when these two soft-bellied sharp-tongued schlubs do battle with the angelic Stephen in the middle. Hovering around him like a crow circling carrion is Marisa Tomei as Ida Horowicz a New York Times reporter who might be the only journalist covering the campaign or at least the only one with a speaking part in the movie. (Go team!)" ���The Ides of March�۝ has loftier less time-bound matters on its mind: the nature of honor the price of loyalty the ways that a man�۪s actions are a measure of his character." swathed in Alexandre Desplat�۪s dark-hued score and Phedon Papamichael�۪s chocolate-and-burgundy cinematography come into relief as Stephen encounters turbulence in his career and his personal life. He stumbles into a professional flirtation with Duffy and almost simultaneously into some hot campaign sex with Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood) a young woman who is ��� no points for guessing right ��� an intern. She also has a powerful daddy and a secret in her past that has the potential to send Stephen�۪s career and the Morris campaign into a tailspin." he works best in long understated scenes that allow him to play with nuances of charm and menace so it is not surprising that as a director he gives the rest of the cast room to work. But the parts of ���The Ides of March�۝ ��� quiet scenes between Mr. Gosling and Ms. Wood; swirling Sorkinesque exchanges of banter; any time Ms. Tomei or Max Minghella (as a campaign worker grooming himself to be the next Stephen Meyers) are in the room ��� are greater than the whole." the film is missing both adrenaline and gravity notwithstanding some frantic early moments and a late swerve toward tragedy. It makes its points carefully and unimpeachably but does not bring much in the way of insight or risk. Powerful men often treat women as sexual playthings. Reporters do not always get things right. Politicians sometimes lie. If any of that sounds like news to you then you may well find ���The Ides of March�۝ downright electrifying." though you will find it more comforting than inspiring. It deals mainly in platitudes and abstractions with just enough detail to hold your interest and keep you hoping for something more.

But while Mr. Nichols employs a handful of tried-and-true (and therefore always persuasive) shock effects to blur the viewer�۪s sense of reality there is something at stake beyond formal cleverness. The ambiguity that is so unbearable to Curtis ��� the sense that he might be losing his mind and also receiving omens of impending disaster ��� is crucial to the film�۪s logic." thoughtful type of guy and his two-fold response to his bad dreams reflects this aspect of his temperament. (Dewart is much more of a hothead and if you met them both at a bar you would think he was the crazy one not Curtis).

Curtis believes that he is delusional but he also believes in his visions. At a certain level of realism ��� assuming that is that you interpret ���Take Shelter�۝ as a film about a man struggling with a psychological disorder ��� this is an important insight into a painful paradox of mental illness that rarely shows up in movies. Curtis suspects that he is sick and is both ashamed of his condition and determined to seek treatment.

His diffidence makes his desperation especially painful and his increasingly strange behavior is made more unsettling by his generally calm demeanor.

Curtis risks making his fears come true putting his job his marriage and his daughter�۪s well-being in jeopardy.

�۝ a stark moody often beautiful-looking dark fable from Russia opens with the image of mixing churning concrete that�۪s soon followed by a shot of a man being tossed into a trough by several others and covered with the gray gunk. The filmmaker Sergei Loznitsa never returns to this terrible scene (it�۪s either a murder or a funeral) which passes without explanation even as it creates an air of dread that instantly settles around the young truck driver Georgy (Viktor Nemets) who sets the story in cryptic motion." it alludes and suggests and sometimes teases you with meaning." for instance Georgy returns to a bleak little apartment and packs up some food studiously not talking to the unsmiling young woman sitting in another room. We can guess that she�۪s his wife but whether or not she is proves less important you realize much later than her apparent dissatisfaction: this you sense isn�۪t a woman who will ache for her man." Georgy is waved off a highway by a patrolman. As he sits in the cab the camera behind his head the shot presents a rich and quietly busy display: to the left of Georgy�۪s head a patrolman talks to him through the driver�۪s-side window while in the distance an old man trudges along the edge of the road. To the right of Georgy�۪s head through the windshield a woman fusses around a parked car while talking to a second patrolman who makes a crudely sexual gesture behind her back. The marvel of this shot isn�۪t just its choreographed action but also that each zone of activity represents much as in a religious triptych a related scene in a single narrative." catastrophic finale. First though Georgy slips away from patrolmen and continues on a journey characterized by ever more anxious and surreal turns including a stop in a village market where he�۪s almost engulfed in a sea of coarse faces and bodies. In his novel ���Ravelstein �۝ Saul Bellow exudes about taking a ���humanity bath �۝ of slipping into the crowd to rejoin humankind but this thronged scene in ���My Joy �۝ with its queasily lurching camera feels like a drowning.

With the cinematographer Oleg Mutu who shot ���4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days �۝ among other Romanian masterworks Mr. Loznitsa finds pictorial beauty ��� and the suggestion of transcendence that beauty can promise ��� in the simplest humblest settings. Everywhere in ���My Joy�۝ the faces and the lives are hard unyielding and the homes are like ruins of an earlier civilization; still there is rough kindness too." though the experience of watching it and piecing together its fragmented story strands is anything but. It�۪s suspenseful mysterious at times bitterly funny consistently moving and filled with images of a Russia haunted both by ghosts and the living dead. (Mr. Loznitsa�۪s debut fiction feature it had its premiere at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival.) The distance between what happens on screen and the title may make it seem as if Mr. Loznitsa is having a cruelly ironic laugh.

�۝ a feel-good and slightly bad comedy-drama about a young man�۪s fight against cancer aims to put a tear in your eye and a sob in your throat if not for long. Certainly the waterworks don�۪t need much plumbing as might be expected when the 27-year-old Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a Seattle radio producer learns that he has a malignant spinal tumor. Shock and grief and bewilderment ensue as do jokes about barbered testicles and the wisdom of playing the C (as in cancer) card with chicks." Kyle played and sometimes bellowed by a shaggy Seth Rogen with his familiar mix of affability innocence and vulgarity. As with most of Mr. Rogen�۪s characters Kyle is really only guilty of coarse manners and of being a puppyish hound which in the bromance world is a natural state of grace close to a benediction. Like all bromance dudes Kyle is the kind of decent guy that every other decent guy wants to have at his side especially if the woman occupying that spot is as uptight as Adam�۪s girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard). She paints abstract canvases and isn�۪t sexually giving so you can guess where that�۪s headed." ���50/50�۝ was written by Will Reiser who based it on his own experiences with spinal cancer. (He and Mr. Rogen became friends while working on the satiric television series ���Da Ali G Show.�۝ Mr. Reiser no longer has cancer.) When the story opens Adam is settling into domesticity with Rachael (he�۪s cleared out a drawer for her in his apartment) and together with Kyle is working at a public radio station. The two men do toil ��� you see Adam briefly laboring over a story about a volcano ��� but their jobs mostly register as afterthoughts narrative rationales for their cars and homes." his disbelief no match for the coolly delivered frightening-sounding medical terms that rush over him like darkness. Within seconds he has crossed into the land of the sick a place that the filmmakers try to portray with real difficult feeling while also making it as cozy and finally unthreatening as possible. It�۪s a tough balancing act one that Mr. Levine and Mr. Reiser struggle with as they ��� along with Kyle�۪s crude cutup and Adam�۪s tragic figure ��� keep toggling between the film�۪s genuinely funny bits and those interludes that grope toward scarier heavier. Then Anna Kendrick as Katherine a 24-year-old therapist assigned to Adam shows up and makes everything better." dejected depressed freaked out wrung out and sick to his stomach but there�۪s something so recessive about Adam or rather underconceived that the character never grabs you as hard as you expect and really need. The problem isn�۪t that he needs to win you over: the diagnosis and Mr. Gordon-Levitt�۪s natural appeal put you on Adam�۪s side readily enough. It�۪s that neither the actor nor the filmmakers can get under Adam�۪s skin despite all the close-ups and the moodily shot scenes filled with the kind of movie silence that feels more like the groping of an uncertain screenwriter than of a man facing his mortality." Mr. Gordon-Levitt keeps your sympathies even when Adam enters wincing-relationship terrain with Rachael. (Ms. Howard improves with each performance but should be careful not to lock herself into shrewish type.) Rachael�۪s behavior doesn�۪t ring true but unlike in some bromances neither is she just another stick figure with breasts and Ms. Howard makes a real character out of her. Other dividends include a very nice Anjelica Huston as Adam�۪s mother the great Philip Baker Hall as a cancer-afflicted curmudgeon self-medicating with weed and best of all Ms. Kendrick (familiar as George Clooney�۪s foil in ���Up in the Air�۝) an actress whose superb comic timing lifts the movie and you."

Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes." Seth Rogen (Kyle) Anna Kendrick (Katherine) Bryce Dallas Howard (Rachael) Anjelica Huston (Diane) Philip Baker Hall (Alan) and Serge Houde (Richard)."

or at least for love stories. That sex often precedes emotional intimacy ��� or proceeds without it ��� is a fact of life that movies with their deep and longstanding investment in romance especially have a hard time dealing with. Contemporary sexual mores tend to be explored either with grim punitive realism (as in Steve McQueen�۪s ���Shame �۝ soon to play at the New York Film Festival) or with cute and careful wishful thinking." an empire built on fantasies of heterosexual happiness for simplifying such complex matters. But there is also a need for stories that address the complex entanglements of love and sex honestly without sentiment or cynicism and with the appropriate mixture of humor sympathy and erotic heat." �۝ Andrew Haigh�۪s astonishingly self-assured unassumingly profound second feature is just such a film. In its matter-of-fact tightly focused observation of two young men who find their one-night stand growing into something more serious the movie ranges over vast often neglected regions of 21st-century life. It is about the paradoxes and puzzlements of gay identity in a post-identity-politics era and also about the enduring mystery of sexual attraction and its consequences." ���Weekend�۝ is also even primarily about the leisure-time activities of ordinary British young people who go to clubs and children�۪s birthday parties settle in to marriage or seek out casual sex and unwind after work with beer hashish and takeout curries." hand-held style that has become the international signature of movies by and about restless youth. The audience does not hear music unless the people on screen hear it too and the overall look and sound display a studious lack of polish. The dialogue feels improvised; the editing is a mix of abrupt cuts and extended takes; and the themes emerge slowly in keeping with the natural diffidence of the characters." anyway.

Later at a gay club his cruising has a similarly low-key slightly abashed aspect." who is more outspoken and outgoing full of jokes opinions and ideas that both unsettle and intrigue his new acquaintance. As they sip coffee in bed Glen pulls out a tape recorder and interviews Russell about the previous night�۪s encounter which the audience has not seen." when sex comes into play between who someone really is and who he wants to be." or that Glen is more politically assertive than Russell who dislikes drawing attention to himself and resists linking his sexuality to a public cause. Their arguments ��� affectionate but intense ��� reflect contrasting personalities and the friction between them is what makes them potentially such an interesting couple. Each one without quite saying so is grappling with basic questions about love and identity. What can I mean to another person? Whom do I want to be with? Who do I want to be?" less honest movie would hasten to provide answers assuming that the lovers require promises and that the audience needs reassurance. But ���Weekend �۝ which is about the risks and pleasures of opening up emotionally in the presence of another remains true to the unsettled open-ended nature of the experience it documents.

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/movies/brad-pitt-in-moneyball-by-bennett-miller.html
�۝ a movie about baseball in the digital age is a beautiful hard case named Billy Beane. Coiled yet cool Billy has the liquid physical grace and bright eyes of a predator. He was built to win. Even his name with its short syllabic bursts sounds ready for ESPN exultations. That he�۪s played by Brad Pitt giving the quintessential Brad Pitt performance just seals the deal. It didn�۪t turn out that way and in 2001 this high school star turned major-league washout was no longer a player but the general manager of the Oakland Athletics the little team that could but didn�۪t." sometimes it did. In 2001 the A�۪s actually finished second in the American League West but that October in the game that opens the movie they lost the Division Series to the New York Yankees. The score was 5-3 but as numbers that flash across the screen suggest ��� $114 457 768 vs. $39 722 689 ��� that loss in the final game of a five-game series was nowhere near a humiliation. Based on Michael Lewis�۪s nimble joyously entertaining nonfiction chronicle of the Athletics�۪ sprint toward the top despite the odds and dollar signs ���Moneyball�۝ is an exuberant fictionalized look at how Mr. Beane helped transform the team one of the poorest in baseball into serious competition for the wealthiest franchises mostly by ignoring everything he�۪d been taught about the game." as more than a few earlier movies have taught was built on rich whiffs of romance and new sod and highly subjective ideas about what it takes to win including looking right for the part having a certain stance on the mound even a good face. Early in ���Moneyball�۝ there�۪s a funny scene of Billy (who of course has a great face) sitting around with his council of elders: the old-timers mostly who scour the country for the next big hope. The old men are jawing about the pluses and minuses of draft prospects ticking off assets and defects but also body parts. At times they sound as if they�۪re looking for Saturday night dates not athletes." but he doesn�۪t have the tools to fix the problem. He gets them when he meets Peter Brand (a just-right Jonah Hill) a computer whiz with an economics degree from Yale and a big man�۪s waddle. (The character is based on Mr. Beane�۪s slim former assistant the Harvard-educated Paul DePodesta now the vice president for player development and amateur scouting for the New York Mets.) With his glasses and middle-management jackets Peter looks like he should be crunching numbers at an accounting firm. But there�۪s a baseball clutched in his hand and a love of the game tucked deep in his being right alongside a radical way of understanding baseball statistics." from a sharp sleek script by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (and a story by Stan Chervin) that smartly borrows lines from Mr. Lewis�۪s book as well as its giddy irreverence ���Moneyball�۝ is a story about how Billy with Peter�۪s help and his laptop crammed with numbers trades old knowledge for new. It�۪s a story of baseball and bean counters the hunt and the kill yet while there are on-field scenes the movie is less about the game as a pastime or passion or even a cruel capitalist sport than as a great epistemological problem. What is the question? Billy asks his bewildered scouts right before hiring Peter a guy with a poster of Plato hanging above his bed." �۝ which is about the creation of Facebook and yet so much more (it was also written by Mr. Sorkin) ���Moneyball�۝ is about a fundamental cultural shift and the rise of the information elite. Instead of going by instinct Peter knows what he knows because he�۪s a disciple of Bill James a once-marginal figure who starting in 1977 began publishing an abstract that offered a new rationalized way of looking at the game. In a nutshell Mr. James looked at baseball statistics in a different light less by breaking the numbers down in another way but by seeing that what appeared to be objective facts like fielding statistics were as he wrote ���a record of opinions.�۝ And these numbers didn�۪t just describe baseball; they gave the game its language its ���fiction and drama and poetry.�۝" looked at its form context meaning and called his new approach sabermetrics. Among other things he could see value in underappreciated often underpaid and ignored players whom conventional thinkers saw as destined for the minors. In the movie Peter preaches this new gospel to Billy who embraces it with born-again fervor partly because it clarifies the mystery of why he never became the player he was drafted to be: he had the tools as the scouts like to say but they just didn�۪t work in the majors. (In reality it was a former general manager of the A�۪s Sandy Alderson now with the Mets who introduced Mr. Beane to Mr. James�۪s work.)" largely shaking off the official art-house pretensions of his breakout feature ���Capote �۝ takes all this seemingly dry dusty inside-baseball stuff and turns it into the kind of all-too-rare pleasurable Hollywood diversion that gives you a contact high. He still has his serious or rather too-serious side: he bookends the story with ophthalmologically close shots of Billy�۪s eyes shining in the dark as if soliciting you to peep into the windows of a soul that as much as any man�۪s or woman�۪s can be revealed emerges through the script and Mr. Pitt�۪s fully inhabited appealingly barbed performance. There are some overhead shots of the A�۪s emerald field too including one of a large American flag being unfurled that feel like the efforts of a director needlessly looking for big symbolic moments perhaps particularly post-Sept. 11." in the details (the ugly rooms the uglier clothing) the performances and especially in the emphasis on process and how teams and players are built and broken saved and discarded. What works in ���Moneyball�۝ is showing not telling: the scenes of men doing and being and sometimes failing as in the interwoven flashbacks to the young Billy played by Reed Thompson. There�۪s an unnecessary Sorkin-sounding lecture toward the finish that explains what you already know; for the most part though the screenplay obscures huge chunks of exposition through the radio chatter of announcers and listeners. And it gives Mr. Pitt who hurtles through the movie a chance to scat like a juiced-up Ella Fitzgerald working his phones and seemingly every other general manager in the country as he transforms a new baseball philosophy into action." as in his testy exchanges bristling with tamped-down fury with the A�۪s manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman wearing a head of peach fuzz and a scowl). Though Mr. Miller holds onto the romance of baseball that Mr. James and others helped strip away (this is after all a tale of winners and losers) Billy doesn�۪t really change: he just becomes his perfect self. When he first goes after Peter he moves in like a shark. Initially Peter can�۪t look Billy in the face and when they talk Peter keeps dropping his eyes like the plain girl who can�۪t believe the hottest guy at school is even talking to her. But he is." based on a story by Stan Chervin and the book by Michael Lewis; director of photography Wally Pfister; edited by Christopher Tellefsen; music by Mychael Danna; production design by Jess Gonchor; costumes by Kasia Walicka Maimone; produced by Michael De Luca Rachael Horovitz and Brad Pitt; released by Columbia Pictures.

Mr. Childers underwent a religious conversion and has since the late 1990s devoted himself to helping orphans in war-torn East Africa. His approach to humanitarianism is unorthodox to say the least. Rather than stay out of the fight he has sometimes embroiled himself in combat particularly against the Lord�۪s Resistance Army a militia led by Joseph Kony that has long terrorized parts of northern Uganda and southern Sudan." in movie terms Mr. Childers�۪s story is too true to be good. ���Machine Gun Preacher �۝ directed by Marc Forster and starring Gerard Butler illustrates some of the ways that a terrific story can turn into a bad film despite the best intentions of everyone involved. The story written by Jason Keller lurches and wanders and the filmmakers seem flummoxed by its ethical and political complexities unable to reconcile the two poles of their hero�۪s personality." which leads up to Sam�۪s spiritual awakening is the strongest as Mr. Forster revisits the pulpy pungent realism that distinguished ���Monster�۪s Ball.�۝ Released from prison Sam returns home to his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) and their daughter Paige (Ryann Campos as a young child Madeline Carroll in adolescence) and plunges back into his old nefarious life. He�۪s a slob and a racist not especially nice to his family and he and his friend Donnie (Michael Shannon) pass their spare time shooting heroin and robbing drug dealers." after an exceptionally brutal night of crime and dissipation Sam goes to church with Lynn and his mother (a nearly silent Kathy Baker) and accepts the Lord. After that everything changes. He starts a construction business and after a short trip to Africa he decides that he has been called to build an orphanage in the middle of a war zone." but then the movie stumbles into ambiguities that it seems unable to address. At times Sam appears to be plagued by doubts and remorse as his mission in Africa pulls him away from his family and involves him in what seem to be morally dubious acts. But what may be crises and turning points are dramatized in such a haphazard and inconclusive manner that their significance to Sam remains unclear." which means that Sam�۪s big decisive moments feel more like mood swings. He sits in church frowning and sweating then steps up to be baptized. Later he frowns and sweats some more after witnessing atrocities in Sudan. At other times he bellows and stamps around ranting on the pulpit of the church he has built back home and haranguing his loyal Sudanese lieutenant Deng (Souleymane Sy Savane). You may wish Mr. Butler would go off into some other movie ��� another ���Bounty Hunter �۝ maybe since Jennifer Aniston is a more suitable antagonist for him than an unseen African warlord ��� and leave Ms. Monaghan and Mr. Shannon to act out a touching and gritty kitchen-sink melodrama." with its topical bent and its sweeping emotions you are meant to feel exhilarated and inspired newly aware of the plight of suffering people and awed by one man�۪s dedication to their cause. But if those feelings arrive in the wake of ���Machine Gun Preacher �۝ it will in some ways be in spite of the movie which turns a fascinating true story into a welter of action-movie attitudes and sentimental clich̩s."

Clumsy collages of dance-floor degeneracy may spark nostalgia among rave-deprived over-50s but are likely to engender only amusement in the rest of us." Mr. Gatien�۪s ascent from jeans salesman to entertainment genius ��� borne on the wave of disco and sunk by a combination of AIDS and the persistent efforts of the Giuliani administration ��� was the stuff of urban legend. Suicide dismemberment and Ecstasy (without which the film�۪s soundtrack becomes virtually unbearable) pepper the communal narrative while worthies like Moby mistily describe the freaks-and-fabulousness aesthetic of Mr. Gatien�۪s clubs as ���Caligula with music.�۝" rocking dark sunglasses or his signature eye patch the gangly Mr. Gatien (who was deported in 2003 for tax evasion) remains largely an enigma.

In its chemical structure it closely resembles the Roberts Syndrome (as in Julia) first identified in ���Pretty Woman�۝ and last seen in ���Larry Crowne.�۝" meaning success in business and a happy family. It�۪s a matter of juggling Ms. Parker�۪s character Kate Reddy confides. The secret is not how you catch but how you throw." whose long-suffering husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) a struggling often unemployed architect becomes a de facto househusband left to bring up their two young children as Kate�۪s star ascends. Kate boasts that there is still heat between them but in the minutes between his taking a shower in preparation for a marital tryst and plunking down next to her in bed she falls fast asleep; so much for heat." and Ms. Parker�۪s maniacally giddy Kate wages a full-scale charm offensive the movie inadvertently makes Kate�۪s supposedly golden life look like a living hell. During much of the movie she behaves like a rat in a maze hyperstimulated by constantly buzzing cellphones as she dashes back and forth between Boston and New York to pitch a deal having something to do with retirement funds. As we all know going to an airport nowadays is about as much fun as a trip to the hospital." directed by Douglas McGrath (���Emma �۝ ���Infamous�۝) mirrors Kate�۪s frazzled state all too well. In one of its more clever touches the film visualizes Kate�۪s endless things-to-do list that gives her insomnia as an animated scrawl." and a scene in which Kate having just learned that her children have lice frantically scratches her head during a high-powered meeting gives the movie a momentary blip of levity. But more often than not Ms. Parker�۪s straining to be funny comes across as desperation to please." the supporting roles are underwritten and the performances anemic. Mr. Kinnear�۪s Richard is a near-cipher who reacts to Kate�۪s hysteria with mild exasperation only raising his voice once (and not very loud). Pierce Brosnan suave as ever but grayer plays Jack Abelhammer the company�۪s head honcho in New York with whom Kate teams to pitch the deal. A calm enlightened impossibly courtly unattached widower who tolerates Kate�۪s every quirk and begins to fall in love with her he is the polar opposite of a driven financial kingpin like Richard Fuld the final former chief executive of Lehman Brothers.

The film is nastier to two Boston matrons nicknamed ���the Momsters �۝ one of whom blithely dispenses anti-Kate barbs while working on an elliptical trainer." Allison (Christina Hendricks) who speaks directly to the camera has more substance although her remarks about the different perceptions of similar male and female behavior in the workplace are about as fresh as ���Have a nice day�۝ and ���Where�۪s the beef?�۝" Momo a spiritual first cousin of Anna Kendrick�۪s Natalie Keener in ���Up in the Air �۝ but icier and more robotic.

as a young filmmaker besotted with the hard-boiled pleasures of classic Hollywood Jean-Luc Godard claimed that all anyone needed to make a film was a girl and a gun. In his new movie ���Drive �۝ Nicolas Winding Refn in thrall to a later Hollywood tradition tests out a slightly different formula. In this case all you need is a guy and a car." of all things a late-model silver Chevy Impala the kind of generic functional ride you might rent at the airport on a business trip. The guy is Ryan Gosling ��� his character has no known proper name and is variously referred to as ���the driver �۝ ���the kid�۝ and ���him�۝ ��� and to watch him steer through Los Angeles at night is to watch a virtuoso at work. Behind the wheel of a getaway car after an uninteresting irrelevant and almost botched robbery the driver glides past obstacles and shakes off pursuers slowing down as often as he accelerates and maintaining a steady pulse rate even as the soundtrack winds up the tension to heart attack levels." of course and that for better and for worse is pretty much the point of ���Drive �۝ the coolest movie around and therefore the latest proof that cool is never cool enough. Mr. Winding Refn is a Danish-born director (���Bronson �۝ ���Valhalla Rising �۝ the ���Pusher�۝ trilogy) some of whose earlier films have inspired ardent almost cultish devotion in cinephile circles." and there�۪s nothing wrong with his taste. He likes the stripped-down highway movies of the 1960s and �۪70s ��� the kind that Quentin Tarantino celebrated in ���Death Proof�۝ ��� and also the atmospheric masculine melancholy associated with Michael Mann. You might also catch a hint of Paul Schrader�۪s ���American Gigolo�۝ and with respect to the story rather than to the visual style a whole bunch of Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone westerns." like Mr. Eastwood�۪s Man With No Name is a solitary figure with no background or connections but with skills that defy explanation. In addition to his getaway gigs he drives stunt cars for movies ��� the source of a witty trompe l�۪oeil sequence early in the film ��� and might have a future on the racing circuit." sun-baked film noir existence." in more or less that order. The girl�۪s name is Irene she is played by Carey Mulligan and she lives with her young son down the hall from the driver. A neighborly flirtation is disrupted by the return from prison of Irene�۪s husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) who gets pulled back into his old life of crime in such a way as to bring out the guns and require from the driver a few gruesomely violent acts of chivalry." a crosshatching of vendettas and betrayals and an ambience of crepuscular Southern California anomie. There is also one scene of pure automotive pleasure when the driver takes Irene and her son on a cruise along the kind of concrete culvert that has often been used for car chases in the past. But this is not ���The Big Lebowski �۝ which took such delight in its status as pastiche that it ended up in a zone of wild originality and real feeling. ���Drive�۝ is somber slick and earnest and also a prisoner of its own emptiness substituting moods for emotions and borrowed style for real audacity." the skill and polish are hard to dispute ��� but rather that it is for all its bravado timid and conventional. In the hands of great filmmakers (like Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Godard to stick with relevant examples) genre can be a bridge between familiar narrative structures and new insights about how people interact and behave. Those are precisely what ���Drive�۝ is missing in spite of some intriguingly nuanced performances." nasal voice make him an unusually sweet-seeming avenger even when he is stomping bad guys into bloody pulp. And Ms. Mulligan�۪s whispery diction and kewpie-doll features have a similarly disarming effect. Irene seems like much too nice a person to be mixed up in such nasty business. Not that she�۪s really mixed up in it. Her innocence is axiomatic and part of the reason the driver goes to such messianic lengths to protect her." you need ��� beyond this girl and this guy and the cars and the weapons ��� a colorful supporting cast. And this is what saves ���Drive�۝ from arch tedium: Mr. Cranston�۪s wheezing anxious loser; Christina Hendricks�۪s seething taciturn underworld professional; and above all Mr. Brooks�۪s diabolically nebbishy incarnation of corruption and venality." Mr. Brooks often exudes a passive-aggressive hostility a latent capacity for violence held in check by neurosis and cowardice. He lets you assume the same in ���Drive�۝ until the moment he stabs someone in the eye with a fork. It�۪s a shocking and oddly glorious moment ��� something a lot of us without quite knowing it or being able to explain just why have been waiting 30 years to see." based on the book by James Sallis; director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel; edited by Matthew Newman; music by Cliff Martinez; production design by Beth Mickle; costumes by Erin Benach; produced by Marc Platt Adam Siegel John Palermo Gigi Pritzker and Michel Litvak; released by FilmDistrict.

He listens to classical music uses big words like ���acutely�۝ and stays in shape by jumping rope. He can�۪t fix a roof or change a tire." for their parts swear and fight and love guns God and football. They listen to Lynyrd Skynyrd and a few of them look as if they could moonlight as roadies for that shaggy tragic Southern band. They leer at David�۪s wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) and are generally ill-mannered when they are not being ostentatiously and menacingly polite. They work with their hands and aren�۪t much for book learning. On an especially hot day one of them says ���This must be that global warmin�۪ you educated fellers are always goin�۪ on about.�۝" a former film critic whose earlier movies include politically tinged thrillers like ���The Contender�۝ and ���Nothing but the Truth �۝ is holding a fun-house mirror up to an America that seems at the moment to thrive on polarization and mutual contempt. The reality is more complicated but something of the corrosive absurd logic of the culture wars is captured in the interactions between David and the gang of good ol�۪ boys who become his mortal enemies." a big blond handsome ex-jock who dated Amy in high school. He artfully exposes David�۪s snobbery and also plays on the newcomer�۪s liberal habits of deference and self-reproach. David may indeed think that he�۪s better than the residents of Blackwater as Charlie insinuates but he also accepts the idea so central to their sense of identity that the locals are more authentic than he is closer to God and the earth and the real America." which only amplifies their contempt. He is someone to be mocked abused and taken advantage of but never respected. Finally after too many indignities and too much bullying he has no choice but to fight back." and it�۪s possible that ���Straw Dogs�۝ will find a cult following among frustrated Democrats going into the next electoral cycle. Peckinpah�۪s version set in a British backwater village made vague allusions to Vietnam and stateside social disorder. Mr. Lurie shoehorns Southern racial history and the shadow of war into a single character an African-American sheriff played by Laz Alonso who is a veteran of the Iraq war." Mr. Lurie�۪s ���Straw Dogs�۝ is more overtly about sexual politics: about the meaning of manhood than about ideology class or cultural differences. Amy a semi-successful actress (she and David met when they were both working on a television crime series) is caught between her husband and the people she grew up with. There is a suggestion that she is unfulfilled in her marriage. Charlie who likes to call her ���Amycakes �۝ takes this as a hint that she still wants him rather than the condescending weakling whose last name she shares." in Peckinpah�۪s version (which starred Susan George and Dustin Hoffman as Amy and David) filmed with uncomfortable (and to many infuriating) eroticism. Mr. Lurie in keeping with the sensibilities of the times makes the assault less ambiguous in its cruelty but in other parts of the movie he holds onto the volatile blend of chivalry and misogyny that made Peckinpah�۪s film such a nasty queasy fascinating document of its era. He also uncovers an unacknowledged layer of feminism in the story a bitter recognition of the inadequacy of male responses to violence against women." reproducing a great many scenes shots and passages of dialogue and tweaking others ever so slightly. As a filmmaker Mr. Lurie cannot hope to match Peckinpah�۪s lyricism but he strikes a decent balance of bluntness and subtlety." writing a scholarly book instead of a screenplay on the Battle of Stalingrad ��� but the story and the characters are fundamentally the same. The belligerent town drunk who instigates the final orgy of violence is a former football coach played by James Woods and a crucial subplot involving his teenage daughter and the village idiot (for want of a more sensitive term) remains intact." though it is pulpy and brutal and at times grotesquely comical. The story does not cohere and the performances are uneven. But as a piece of film criticism ��� as a conversation with and interpretation of an earlier film ��� it is intriguing." a revelation of the beast that lurks in the heart of even the most civilized and passive modern man. But David�۪s homicidal frenzy is not really a descent into the primal macho swamp of vengeance and self-defense where his antagonists have always been content to dwell. He is not defending Amy or punishing her rapists ��� in neither version does she tell him about the attack ��� but rather taking up arms in defense of two abstract ideas: the sanctity of private property and the importance of due process." a bear trap and two pots of boiling oil to keep his tormentors at bay. I�۪m kidding to some extent. The response to righteous movie mayhem is always more visceral than philosophical.

These are tough guys but you can only care about them if you believe that they can break." what will happen at Sparta is never really in doubt. Though there are other imposing fighters in the Spartan ranks ��� including a fearsome Russian who recalls (though he does not physically resemble) Dolph Lundgren in ���Rocky IV�۝ ��� it is obvious that the bad brotherly blood between Tommy and Brendan can be expiated only one way in a final showdown." who wrote the ���Warrior�۝ screenplay with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman knows perfectly well that surprise is not the essence of sports-movie suspense. A few years back he directed ���Miracle �۝ a rousing reconstruction of one of the most celebrated athletic moments in recent history the 1980 victory of the underdog United States Olympic ice hockey team over its fearsome Soviet rival. It�۪s not as if knowing the outcome of the real story diminishes that movie�۪s impact.

Brendan Tommy and Paddy uphold traditional family values ��� the tradition that is of Cain and Abel Jacob and Esau King Lear and the fallen houses of ancient Greek tragedy." he nonetheless grounds it in the painful realities of contemporary America. With arresting honesty and enormous compassion ��� but without making a big topical deal out of it ��� ���Warrior�۝ looks at an American working class reeling from the one-two punch of war and recession. Tommy and Brendan are too proud for self-pity which makes the evident pain of their circumstances all the more affecting." undermined or taken away.

The mock-gladiatorial theatrics of mixed martial arts may look tawdry and overblown but the sport perhaps even more than boxing expresses a deep and authentic impulse to find meaning through the infliction and acceptance of pain.

�۝ Steven Soderbergh�۪s smart spooky thriller about a thicket of contemporary plagues ��� a killer virus rampaging fear an unscrupulous blogger ��� is as ruthlessly effective as the malady at its cool cool center. Set in the world-is-flat now the movie tracks a mystery pathogen after it catches a ride on a flight from Hong Kong to Chicago an early hop for a globe-sprinting pandemic that cuts across borders and through bodies as effortlessly as Mr. Soderbergh moves among genres styles and eras this time by updating 1970s paranoia freakouts like ���All the President�۪s Men�۝ for the anti-government Tea Party age." Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) who shortly after returning home from Hong Kong is twitching on her Minneapolis kitchen floor mouth foaming and eyes glassing over. Was it the moo goo gai pan? Not exactly her husband Mitch (Matt Damon in a small crucial sympathetic performance) soon learns. And that�۪s something you learn quickly in turn: Nothing moves slowly here especially the disease which within days cuts down seemingly everyone who�۪s been within touching kissing handshaking dice-blowing distance of a carrier. Like the ladies in the old shampoo ads (���I told two friends about it and they told two friends and so on�۝) Beth just keeps on giving." the composer Cliff Martinez and the editor Stephen Mirrione Mr. Soderbergh invests the story with visceral urgency opening it with a screen steeped in black ��� an intimation perhaps of the looming abyss ��� and the sounds of a few hard rasping coughs. This almost deviously funny overture is followed by a close-up of Beth wearing a sheen of sweat and no visible makeup the image stamped ���Day 2.�۝ Listing forward as if she was about to throw up on the camera tilted up at her she looks about as bad as Ms. Paltrow probably can given the ugly situation and the queasy-beautiful yellowish light that Mr. Soderbergh expressionistically employs throughout." but your own gorge may rise when the camera shifts from Beth ��� who takes a flirty call from her unseen lover her wedding ring gleaming in the shot ��� to linger briefly on a jar of shelled peanuts set on the airport bar in front of her. Beth may be (relatively) bad but those peanuts are murder as is the credit card she hands to the waitress. The story subsequently hopscotches to several other people ��� a young man stumbling through a Hong Kong market a Japanese salaryman grimacing on a plane and a model staggering in London ��� who flash in and out of the movie . Like Beth whose young son Clark (Griffin Kane) welcomes her home with open vulnerable arms each proves to be part of the lethal puzzle." a deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and another doctor Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) whom he sends into a chaotic field that before long is littered with the dead and populated by a mounting military presence. Rounding out a medical SWAT team which is almost as self-consciously sexy and quirky as the thieves in Mr. Soderbergh�۪s ���Ocean�۪s�۝ movies are a pair of C.D.C. doctors Ally Hextall (a wonderful Jennifer Ehle) and David Eisenberg (Demetri Martin) who hoist test tubes and send rhesus monkeys to their deaths as well as a sleuthing doctor for the World Health Organization Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard). Elliott Gould one of Mr. Soderbergh�۪s favorites and a keystone ���Ocean�۪s�۝ player adds to the casting pleasures." notably a San Francisco blogger (Jude Law snaggletoothed and embracing the designated creep role) with the unfortunate name of Alan Krumwiede as in crumb-weedy. (Mr. Soderbergh also took aim at bloggers in ���The Girlfriend Experience.�۝) A self-proclaimed outsider ��� ���print media is dying �۝ he yells at a skeptical (and pregnant) newspaper editor ��� Krumwiede latches onto the pandemic early and before long is profiting from it on his blog (Truth Serum Now) where he pushes a holistic cure forsythia a yellow flowering plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. Mr. Soderbergh may like to play outside the cinematic mainstream now and then (as in ���Bubble�۝) but there�۪s no place for alternatives like blogging and complementary medicine in ���Contagion �۝ where the stakes are too catastrophically high." but the most obvious peril is the virus in and out of the laboratory. To that race-against-time end there are weirdly beautiful near-surreal images of Ally and David wafting about in their violently red protective suits like space travelers heading off to science-fiction battle. Except that they ��� like the other good doctors including Erin seen wrangling one regional official who testily asks who�۪s paying for the triage services provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other big-government groups ��� are terra-firma rationalists. They�۪re fighting a disease along with natural fear and unnatural fear mongers like Krumwiede who from his bloggy pulpit dismisses science in the name of independence even as he sells out his readers." paranoia self-interest and the denial of science this movie is certainly of the moment even if it also evokes the past. At several points Krumwiede meets up with a speculator who�۪s looking to turn a profit on the crisis in scenes that suggest Robert Redford as Bob Woodward hovering in the dark with Deep Throat in ���All the President�۪s Men.�۝ The meetings in the two movies are conspicuously different in look and intent yet the characters seem to be gasping the same unclean air as they shed light on a shadow world of power greed and dirty tricks. One crucial difference being that in the 1970s it was the government that played the villain while this time it�۪s on the side of right." �۝ if Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath had not already set the stage. Mr. Soderbergh doesn�۪t milk your tears as things fall apart but a passion that can feel like cold rage is inscribed in his images of men and women isolated in the frame in the blurred point of view of the dying and in the insistent stillness of a visual style that seems like an exhortation to look. The virus seriously rattles your nerves and you may want to start stockpiling antibacterial soap now. Yet what�۪s really scary in ���Contagion�۝ is how fast once-humming airports and offices homes and cities empty out when push comes to shove comes to panic in the streets." multiple on-screen if nongory deaths and a graphic autopsy during which a human head is peeled like a banana."

it has an unhappy ending at least for him and his wife Elena who were executed on Christmas Day 1989. Yet in many respects Ceausescu turns out to be as much the author of this brilliant documentary as the director Andrei Ujica who waded through more than 1 000 hours of filmed state propaganda official news reports and home movies to create a cinematic tour de force that tracks the rise reign and grim fall of its subject." Mr. Ujica has made several movies about the 1989 Romanian revolution and the collapse of Soviet-era Communism (���Videograms of a Revolution�۝ and ���Out of the Present�۝). The title of his latest was inspired by ���The Autobiography of Fidel Castro �۝ a novel that in turn took its name from Gertrude Stein�۪s ���Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.�۝ Like the Stein book a mock memoir that mixes fiction and nonfiction and was written by Stein from Toklas�۪s point of view ���Nicolae Ceausescu�۝ is something of a rarefied ventriloquist act. It uses one body ��� here the public and private Ceausescu ��� as a way to reveal the truth about another life in this case that of a country under the totalitarian heel." the documentary opens with smeary jerky color images of the Ceausescus during their hastily convened and administrated trial shortly before their execution. Seated side by side their backs to the wall they look frail shrunken. Accusations are announced denials too. It�۪s all very fast and for the uninitiated perhaps confusing especially given the lack of a voice-over or other explanations. Whether or not you�۪re schooled in Romanian history though it�۪s hard to reconcile these crude visuals with the pomp and parades that follow which is the point. For decades beginning in 1965 these two Lilliputians ��� Ceausescu hovered in the vicinity of 5 foot 5 ��� ruled a country that they turned into a projection of their self-mythologizing a Potemkin village for two." the movie shifts back in time and to extreme overhead images filmed in sumptuous black and white of hundreds upon hundreds of people running toward some unknown destiny. From this lofty perch you can�۪t see the faces of these men women and children who take the beautifully abstracted metaphorically potent shape of an undifferentiated surging mass. Those faces come into clearer view in a later sequence with a state official that the historically minded (and Google researchers) will recognize as Ceausescu�۪s predecessor Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej a revolutionary who rose to power after World War II and held on until his death in 1965. And the small man helping carry out the Gheorghiu-Dej coffin? Why that�۪s the young Ceausescu doing his best to look downcast." Ceausescu rarely seems to have done anything without a camera whirring nearby. Here he is in black and white and there in color; here with sound and there without. Here and there he kisses gaga swooning women; dances with villagers; claps old-timers on the back. Always there are the people massing and waiting and waving. Sometimes those masses gathered in Romania and at times in China and North Korea ��� both countries put on jaw-dropping shows ��� and also farther afield in Western countries like Britain that were willing to roll out the red carpet for Romania�۪s peripatetic first couple." what Mr. Ujica working with his terrific editor and sound designer Dana Bunescu makes us see and understand? It�۪s unlikely though it�۪s hard not to notice the difference in Ceausescu�۪s posture during an early visit filmed in black and white to a food market its stocked shelves groaning with proletariat bread and Party promises and a later grimmer visit to a market shot in color. He�۪s older of course and grayer though the hair still towers longingly upward. But by then even the Romanian propaganda machine couldn�۪t obscure the despair hanging over the increasingly desolate cities and a people whose early smiles had long disappeared along with the promises." 144 West 65th Street Lincoln Center.

�۝ among other things an extraordinary feat of editing and archival research takes up a familiar period in American history from a fresh and fascinating angle. In the late 1960s and early �۪70s Swedish television journalists traveled to the United States with the intention of ���showing the country as it really is.�۝ Some of the images and interviews they collected have been assembled by Goran Hugo Olsson into a roughly chronological collage that restores a complex human dimension to the racial history of the era." a veteran of the freedom rides early in the decade who like many young black activists had grown frustrated with the Gandhian nonviolent philosophy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Carmichael who later moved to Guinea and took the name Kwame Ture is remembered for the militancy of his views and his confrontational often slashingly witty speeches but the Swedish cameras captured another side of him. In the most touching and arresting scene in ���Mixtape �۝ he interviews his mother Mable gently prodding her to talk about the effects of poverty and discrimination on her family." with its talk of revolution national liberation and armed struggle had its roots in bitter experience. And while ���The Black Power Mixtape�۝ tells a story of defiance and pride it is also a tale of defeat frustration and terrible destruction. The assassination of Dr. King the grinding toll of the Vietnam War the Attica prison uprising the spread of heroin in the ghettoes of northern cities: these are not chapters in a tale of triumph." which had published an article accusing the European news media ��� and Sweden�۪s in particular ��� of presenting an overly negative view of American society. Mr. Olsson�۪s film does not entirely refute that charge but the impression it leaves is of a compassionate curiosity a willingness to listen that Americans have not always then or now afforded one another. The voices of contentious well-known figures like Angela Davis and Louis Farrakhan are heard as are those of ordinary residents of Harlem Brooklyn and Oakland Calif." ���The Black Power Mixtape�۝ is not a comprehensive history. Its impressionistic visual record of recent history is accompanied by the present-day reflections of participants in that history and younger people who have been influenced by it. Ms. Davis the poet Sonia Sanchez and Abiodun Oyewole of the Last Poets muse on the meaning and legacy of black power as do the musicians Erykah Badu Questlove John Fort̩ and others." though at other times the nuances and contradictions of the past outstrip the didacticism of the commentary. But the fact that the speakers�۪ faces are never seen produces a feeling of estrangement that is crucial to the film�۪s effectiveness. You become acutely aware of gaps and discontinuities: between slogans and realities between political ideals and stubborn social problems between then and now." wondering how much has changed and how the change took place. How did we get from the America of Stokely Carmichael to the America of Barack Obama who represents a very different kind of black power? To what extent is it the same America? Perhaps there are some visitors from Sweden out there who can help us make sense of it all."

The matches he played against Boris Spassky in Iceland in 1972 were a global media event. A world championship was at stake and so were cold war bragging rights as Fischer a prickly individualist from Brooklyn took on Mr. Spassky a product of the great totalitarian Soviet chess machine. Fischer�۪s tactical brilliance and nerdy charisma inspired an explosion of interest in the game. Chess clubs popped up in schools all over America and Fischer was added to the roster of sports heroes that children dreamed of emulating." sadder side that has over the years overshadowed Fischer�۪s remarkable achievements as a player. His behavior before and during the tournament in Iceland was bizarre. He almost did not show up taking refuge at the New York home of Anthony Saidy a fellow American grandmaster and a crucial voice in Ms. Garbus�۪s film. In Reykjavik he arrived late to matches and complained continually about the conditions of play actions that were seen by some at the time as a form of psychological warfare intended to throw his opponent off guard." rivals and colleagues it seems more likely that the turmoil of Fischer�۪s inner life was spilling out into the quiet and orderly arena of chess. Almost as soon as the duel with Mr. Spassky was over Fischer disappeared from public view only to return two decades later as a decidedly unheroic figure. After playing a tournament in Belgrade in the middle of the Balkan war and in defiance of a United States travel ban he lived in exile in Japan and Iceland giving increasingly strident voice to a paranoid worldview rife with conspiracy theories and riddled with anti-Semitism. (Fischer himself was of Jewish background.)" a poignant and repellent shadow of his brash and brilliant younger self. What happened? ���Bobby Fischer Against the World�۝ does not traffic in easy explanations or medical diagnoses but it leaves the strong impression of a continuity between the oddness Fischer displayed in early interviews and the mania so jarringly evident toward the end. And it also tactfully but strongly posits a connection between the genius he brought to an infinitely complex game and the madness that defined his relationship to just about everything else." so the question of Fischer�۪s possible mental illness is left to hover at the margins of the film.

an attitude that the humorless mystically fortified golfing movie ���Seven Days in Utopia�۝ embraces unashamedly." the movie directed by Matthew Dean Russell is based on David L. Cook�۪s 2009 inspirational novel ���Golf�۪s Sacred Journey: Seven Days at the Links of Utopia �۝ a kind of Southern-fried Christian ���Tuesdays With Morrie.�۝ Utopia is the name of the idyllic little Texas town population 373 (according to the screenplay credited to four writers including Mr. Cook) where Luke Chisholm (Lucas Black) an ambitious young professional golfer lands after an embarrassing public meltdown." Luke runs his car through a fence on the property of Johnny Crawford (Robert Duvall) a weather-beaten rancher and former golf pro who arrives in his pickup truck and gently takes Luke in hand. Johnny volunteers to coach Luke if he will spend the next week in Utopia where the rancher houses the young golfer in his trophy-filled office and treats him like an honored guest." Sarah Hawkins (Deborah Ann Woll) a pretty waitress and aspiring horse whisperer with a flowing strawberry-blond mane." God�۪s golf lessons channeled through Johnny help Luke regain his confidence and in the climactic scenes he faces off with an unflappable champion T. K. Oh (K. J. Choi) at the Texas Open." Luke finds a new and better grip and learns patience during a fly-fishing trip with his mentor. A sort of born-again Zen master Johnny teaches Luke to paint his shots (literally on a canvas) before making them. He takes Luke aloft in a small airplane then cuts the engine leaving it to Luke to make a smooth landing." most notably a love of the bottle which cost him his marriage to a woman whose loss he still mourns. No one plays wise old coots more convincingly than Mr. Duvall now 80. He imparts as much gravity and heart as any actor could to Mr. Cook�۪s folksy homilies of which the most insistent is embodied in the motto ���see it feel it trust it�۝ that Luke scrawls on his golf balls as ���s.f.t.�۝" at which point ���Seven Days in Utopia�۝ swoons into its own solemn sanctimony."

���Love Crime�۝ ��� the last film directed by Alain Corneau who died in 2010 ��� looks like a corporate ���All About Eve�۝ in reverse. An innocent eager young woman named Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier) is manipulated and preyed upon by her mentor Christine (Kristin Scott Thomas) a high-ranking executive whose affection seems to be an especially insidious form of sadism." gifts and kisses that land in a gray area between collegial affection and something riskier. Isabelle for her part accepts plum work assignments and tries at once to please her boss and to imitate her. Dispatched to Cairo at the last minute along with Philippe (Patrick Mille) a business associate who is also Christine�۪s lover Isabelle negotiates an important deal. She also sleeps with Philippe which may have been part of Christine�۪s plan." and tries with the help of a loyal co-worker named Daniel (Guillaume Marquet) to get some revenge. She and Christine wage a stealthy war each trying to undermine the other while maintaining at least a minimum of professional decorum. But things quickly escalate and icy looks and poisonous whispers give way to forged memos brutal humiliations and finally outright violence." Mr. Corneau makes witty use of the contrasting faces and temperaments of the two main actresses. Ms. Thomas her manner as impeccable and dry as her French is all angles and edges most terrifying when she seems most at ease. Ms. Sagnier soft and skittish and visibly struggling to maintain her composure turns out to be even scarier." though ��� to say exactly when would ruin a fairly stunning surprise ��� the cat-and-mouse psychology is jettisoned in favor of something more procedural. The two halves of ���Love Crime�۝ divide according to the words of the title: the first explores the knotty feverish ambiguous bond between Christine and Isabelle while the second is all about guilt innocence evidence and motive. It is interesting and ingenious even if some of the kinky queasy fascination that had been so intoxicating in the earlier scenes ebbs away." and their moneyed world is sleek attractive and also absurd. It becomes hilariously so whenever the American bosses show up either for quick on-scene meetings or video conferences. Then the dialogue switches to English and to an idiom of upbeat management boilerplate captured with devastating accuracy." ���Fear and Trembling �۝ Sylvie Testud played a young Belgian woman living in Tokyo squirming under the stiletto heel of her supervisor. And in that film as in ���Love Crime �۝ sympathy for the underdog was balanced or perhaps undermined by detached amused prurience. You can�۪t help rooting for Isabelle but at the same time you are hoping for things to get really nasty."

special-effects-laden action blockbuster though you will not find it in wide release. In a utopian borderless world without subtitles the arrival of ���Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame�۝ would be a global multiplex event and the work of its director Tsui Hark would be at least as well known among American seekers of cinematic thrills as that of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay. But make no mistake while its footprint here may be small there is nothing modest about this spectacle." an auteur of Hong Kong cinema is a household name and ���Detective Dee�۝ demonstrates the nature of his appeal. Witty but not campy grand without being unduly somber it is a crazy almost-coherent riot of intrigue color and kineticism anchored by the charisma of its cast." a seventh-century sleuth summoned to the imperial palace to investigate a series of spontaneous combustions. On the eve of the coronation of a controversial empress (Carina Lau) as workers scramble to finish a gigantic Buddha important officials start bursting into flames. Dee who had been out of political favor and in prison for several years sets out to unravel an elaborate conspiracy involving all manner of treachery hidden agendas shadowy assassins and an occasional talking animal." the empress�۪s favorite; Pei (Chao Deng) a sullen blond-haired constable; and Zhong (Tony Leung Ka-fai) who knows a lot about pyrotechnics and Buddha design. The plot does not so much twist as lurch from one revelation to another. Expository dialogue alternates with and is sometimes interrupted by a hail of arrows a dazzling flight of combat choreography computer-assisted explosions or some combination of them all." a specialist in the quasi-historical sword-and-fantasy martial-arts genre known as wuxia is both a traditionalist and an innovator eager to blend classic Hong Kong athleticism with the newest techniques of digital filmmaking. In this he joins other directors in Hong Kong and on the Chinese mainland who are inventing a hybrid cinematic vocabulary that is rooted in local traditions and yet is in evident conversation with similar experiments. A new kind of moviemaking is taking shape around the world that reconfigures traditional distinctions between animation and live action. To look at ���Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame�۝ alongside ���Rise of the Planet of the Apes�۝ and ���Transformers: Dark of the Moon�۝ is to attend a long noisy seminar in the state of the art." though. There is enough emotion and suspense to hold your attention and an intimation of political allegory to give you something to think about.

�۝ and ���orgy-porgy�۝ is a cheerful rallying cry for hedonists stimulated by an Ecstasy-like drug called soma to pile onto one another and party down. In ���A Good Old Fashioned Orgy �۝ it�۪s not as easy as that and instead of soma there is endless booze." �۝ but this movie about a group of 30ish friends inhibited by the threat of AIDS from sexually running wild suggests that we are lurching and bumbling in that direction. The catalyst is Eric (Jason Sudeikis) an old hand at party giving who proposes a Labor Day weekend blowout at which he and his circle of friends can play catch-up with the 1970s by stripping for action and getting it on." though its title might suggest otherwise. There are no Apatow-style zingers that leave your mouth hanging open in grossed-out amazement." �۝ Paul Mazursky�۪s grimly anxious middle-class wife-swapping movie which was groundbreaking in 1969." �۝ you must accept the notion that friends who have known one another forever would want to have sex together after all that time. More often than not the psychological baggage that comes with friendship is a libidinal inhibitor. These semi-likable people mostly upwardly mobile New York professionals are at an age when ���the heyday in the blood �۝ to quote Shakespeare has begun its retreat. Instead of getting naked to let off steam they would rather get wasted." to which they have repaired on summer weekends for drunken theme parties is being put up for sale. The movie opens at one such party a ���White Trash Bash�۝ where revelers in mullet wigs and hair curlers scoop up bean dip from a toilet and slip and slide in beer." Eric proposes a full-scale orgy. Most of the men warily agree; the women who are much more attractive are a tougher sell. As everyone slowly warms to the idea the movie lightly touches on the expected issues of anxiety about body image and desirability." Eric decides research must be conducted. The movie�۪s funniest scene takes place at a mattress store that doubles as a swingers�۪ club where a gallery of grotesques revels in kinky sex acts. Here Eric discovers the prim real estate agent for his father�۪s house Dody (Lin Shaye) outfitted as a dominatrix. His blossoming flirtation with Dody�۪s beautiful assistant Kelly (Leslie Bibb) who makes a date with him that coincides with the orgy complicates things to no end." a suave party boy is something of a babe magnet but not obnoxiously so. His Falstaffian sidekick Mike (Tyler Labine) who strips down to a leopard-print thong is the closest thing to John Belushi or Jack Black. This softhearted movie invests Mike with some pathos when one character accurately calls him a loser and Eric�۪s pet." who has always pined for Eric the orgy holds out romantic possibility. Laura (Lindsay Sloane) is shy and sexually inhibited and Adam (Nick Kroll) is a nerd so attached to his BlackBerry that it is a virtual umbilical cord. Alison (Lake Bell) a gabby annoyingly judgmental psychologist vengefully signs on after a nasty clash with her boyfriend over personal grooming. Duquez (Martin Starr) an uptight would-be hipster musician bows out of the festivities to complete a CD. Will Forte and Lucy Punch play Glenn and Kate newlyweds and the group�۪s only married friends who decide at the last minute to crash the party." the orgy is tame even by soft-core standards. The players experience blips of liberation from a lesbian kiss to a first orgasm to the stirrings of true love. It�۪s all very sweet and lightly comedic. After it�۪s over you half expect a statement to appear on the screen promising ���No humans were traumatized during the making of this film.�۝" flashes of nudity and explicit sex talk."
