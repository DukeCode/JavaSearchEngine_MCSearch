conditioned to view Iraq through the lens of contemporary wartime journalism as a primitive fractious land of Shiites Sunnis and other sects in continual conflict the documentary will be a revelation. Not so long ago Iraq was much more westernized than it is today and scenes of Iraqis in Western garb living comfortable middle-class lives in happier times puts a lump in your throat." �� a two-and-a-half-hour personal history written and directed by the Swiss filmmaker Samir (full name Samir Jamal Aldin) is the kind of documentary whose length and complexity make you approach it with some apprehension. Watching it is like slowly leafing through a giant scrapbook whose contents include the individual stories of a large extended family." �� and throughout the movie there are flashes of scenes from ���Ulysses �� a 1955 movie starring Kirk Douglas. If ���Iraqi Odyssey�� is a Homeric parable he suggests Iraq is the equivalent of Penelope patiently waiting for Odysseus to return. But in this version Penelope loses patience and marries one of her suitors. There isn��t a triumphant homecoming and it is doubtful whether given all that has happened such a homecoming is possible but one can still dream. There is a joyful family reunion; it is not on Iraqi soil but in Switzerland." articulate intelligent attractive and cosmopolitan. They make the best of a bad situation. What is remarkable is the clan��s cohesion despite being separated by thousands of miles. They sadly acknowledge that the homeland they were forced to flee barely exists anymore. The country one family member says has ���gone back 500 years.��" things go mostly downhill. Hussein��s rise led to Iraq��s pointless eight-year war with Iran and the worsening horrors of his dictatorship followed by the American invasion of the country. For all the politics described in the film ���Iraqi Odyssey�� never becomes bogged down in strident rhetoric and analysis although the family members who chose to settle in the Soviet Union instead of Britain regret their decision." members of the clan flirted with Communism but they weren��t infatuated with Marxist ideology so much as encouraged by the Communists�� determination to improve the lives of the working class. At a crucial turning point one family member recalls the Baath Party which was solidifying its power out of which emerged Saddam Hussein waited in vain for help from the Soviet Union. He theorizes that the outcome of the Cuban missile crisis prevented the Soviets from intervening; they didn��t want another confrontation with the United States." Samir��s relatives who are seen at different ages and in different places belong to the Jamal Aldin clan a well-educated line of professionals who trace their ancestry to the Prophet Muhammad. They became secularists during the period beginning in the 1920s of British rule. Today they belong to a diaspora of Iraqi �migr�s scattered across the globe. Family members have landed in places as far-flung as Auckland New Zealand; Buffalo; London; and Zurich where Samir settled with his Swiss wife. Late in the movie Samir remarks with some bitterness that since settling there he hasn��t made a single friend."

In the hands of a determined business a violent invention can be a game-changer that gives rise to tragic losses." the movie becomes a dense stew of words and death. The company��s boosterism of the benefits of ���neuromuscular incapacitation�� for law enforcement and its highly constrained sense of responsibility together suggest something out of ���RoboCop.�� (Company motto: ���Protecting Life. Protecting Truth.��)" but the footage of the massive animals crumpling effectively illustrates a macho fantasy of violent control fulfilled by the weapon. The heavily researched documentary features surveillance and dashboard video of people killed by Tasers and demonstrates the results of the device��s widespread adoption by the police often without sufficient training. Taser International also has its say through an empty-eyed publicity representative and the Smiths who argue that the weapon saves lives as an alternative to a gun." use and abuse of the Taser form the discomfiting subject of Nick Berardini��s ���Killing Them Safely �� but an equally formidable weapon also goes on display: words. In the 1990s the brothers Rick and Tom Smith amped up a decades-old invention to create their electricity-zapping ���home run product.�� Since then their company Taser International has defended the Taser��s virtues with on-message verbiage in the face of deaths associated with the weapon."

Mr. Lanzmann (whose footage Mr. Grunberg often borrows from) devoted a documentary ���The Karski Report �� to the man who ultimately taught for years at Georgetown University. ���Karski & the Lords of Humanity�� is fascinating but Mr. Lanzmann��s efforts tower over it." �� Claude Lanzmann��s definitive nine-and-a-half-hour 1985 documentary about the Holocaust was Jan Karski a Pole whose undercover missions in World War II gave early information to the Allies about the extermination of Polish Jews. Slawomir Grunberg��s stately documentary ���Karski & the Lords of Humanity�� focuses exclusively on Karski��s courageous adventures in intrigue and espionage." dapper erudite and multilingual Karski (1914-2000) who was blessed with a photographic memory and educated as a diplomat before serving in the military was an ideal candidate for the Resistance. Often working for the Polish government in exile in London he conducted many missions among them a trip incognito to the Warsaw Ghetto illustrated here with utterly harrowing photographs. Karski presented his eyewitness account in person to officials in Britain and eventually President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His exploits ��� surviving brutal torture by the Gestapo; a daring hospital escape; smuggling microfilm; using medical mean to disguise his accent ��� are fleshed out with vivid animated sequences while experts offer testimony."

Scientists and other experts help him out expressing their concerns ��� like the weaknesses in our legislation and the impotence of the Environmental Protection Agency ��� with alarming clarity." Jon Whelan did smell something ��� a strange stench from his daughters�� new pajamas ��� and began a three-year journey to track down its source. What he learned was that the seller of the nightwear a store called Justice (owned by Tween Brands) was not the only company that closely guards the identity of the synthetic substances lurking in its products. He also discovered that any manufacturer could cram as many of these as it wanted including known carcinogens under the umbrella term ���fragrance �� without being required to name a single one." ���If you smell something say something �� he wasn��t speaking literally. Yet he would probably approve of ���Stink! �� a heartfelt documentary about the chemical industry��s aggressive efforts to conceal the thousands of potentially toxic ingredients contained in everyday products." ���Stink!�� is likely to incite at the least a purging of Axe body spray from adolescent boys�� bedrooms ��� even though contrary to the suspicions of some of us who have smelled it it is in no way linked to a mysterious shot of a container in a scent warehouse labeled ���Monkey Farts.��"

Arlo (now voiced by Raymond Ochoa) is in full possession of his fear which inspires some comedy and leads to some tender father-and-son moments. These include a nocturnal walk with Poppa who with his long agile tail and the help of swarms of fireflies draws phosphorescent swirls in the grass a preview of the more visually entrancing passages to come. Arlo��s fear soon sends him like a really big Bambi off on a lovely daft gently surreal and perilous journey. And somewhat like Bambi he initially sets off on that odyssey alone after a storm first sweeps away Poppa ��� a catastrophe that��s blunt and subtle delivered with panicked shouts and sealed with a merciful cut to black ��� and then sweeps away Arlo too leaving him stranded frightened and far from home." a violent churn that suggests the threatening turbulence of the dinosaurs�� climate and ours. Clouds don��t merely gather they also boil creating whirlpools that bring monsoonal rains and swollen waters that defeat leviathans in an instant as casually as a flick of Mother Nature��s wrist. If ���Inside Out �� the last Pixar movie asked what makes us human (laughter for one salted with tears) ���The Good Dinosaur�� suggests that there��s a great deal more to the story than we Homo sapiens. Here nature isn��t a backdrop or an afterthought but the main event ��� a buzzing blooming wonder from the soft pink of a sun-kissed sky to the crystal waters that Arlo runs alongside and the huge pines that vault over him like a cathedral." a large spread that��s nestled next to a jagged mountain range and dominated by plowed fields and a house the size of an airplane hangar. The farm has its modest amusements visual and verbal including a pen crammed with ferocious prehistoric hens that alive look halfway plucked. (You don��t see a kitchen or a waiting ax so presumably the family gobbles the eggs not the birds.) The director Peter Sohn working from a story he concocted with a small posse (Erik Benson Kelsey Mann Bob Peterson and the screenwriter Meg LeFauve) lights a teasingly long fuse." you may miss that nod to human nature. ���The Good Dinosaur�� has a few things on its mind but its tone is overwhelmingly playful not hectoring. Like most children��s movies it offers a lesson or two mostly about being true to yourself (and the equally helpful message to always follow the river) but what lingers is the beautiful animation that��s by turns painterly and borderline photorealist and in itself an ode to the natural world. It��s only when Arlo and Spot meet other talking dinosaurs that things become tricky as when they encounter a troika of friendly Tyrannosaurs led by Butch (Sam Elliott with his customary mellifluous cowboy drawl) in a meeting that ever so briefly and transportingly turns this recast fantasia into PG Cormac McCarthy." more or less that science hypothesizes the dinosaurs bit the dust the wizards at Pixar have forged another creation story. Instead of crashing the space rock zips past the big blue marble. Fast forward a few million years to what looks like the American Northwest where two apatosaurs are farming the land tilling the soil with honest sweat and giant noses." with ductile physicality and emerald eyes Spot injects a lot of anarchic physical comedy into the proceedings and more than a little violence. (He also introduces the concept of shame: Unlike all the other creatures talking and otherwise he wears a leafy loincloth.) A hunter and scavenger Spot has a bite that turn out to be more fearsome than his bark and soon he��s tearing off the head of a bright glittering beetle he brings Arlo. (Arlo an herbivore is understandably repulsed by this beastly offering.) It��s no wonder that another dinosaur a delicately designed mournful Styracosaurus called Pet Collector (Mr. Sohn working a lachrymose bleat) who melts in and out of the woods with an army of silent critters wants to name Spot ���Killer.��" whose extinction is this anyway? Not anyone��s as far as this quietly hopeful movie is concerned. In its outlines ���The Good Dinosaur�� spins a familiar tale in a boy��s own story that��s shaped by the usual highs and lows frowns and smiles with heart-swelling triumphs and even some Boy Scout-style bivouacking when Arlo builds a shelter out of trees. Except that here the boy is a talking agrarian dinosaur who after his calamitous separation encounters a howling snarling scrambling barking nontalking human wild child who quickly becomes Arlo��s faithful companion whom he names Spot (Jack Bright a squalling a cappella orchestra of one). And just like that in the beginning there was a dinosaur ��� followed by a kid scampering after him on all fours." sometimes furry worlds making it easy to go with the unfamiliar flow. As the flyover asteroid suggests ���The Good Dinosaur�� is charmingly different but its oddness sneaks up on you only after the filmmakers lay out some storybook bona fides. Here the once-upon-a-time begins with Momma (soothingly voiced by Frances McDormand) and Poppa (Jeffrey Wright) having three babies who hatch within seconds of one another. The runt turns into a scene-stealer Arlo (Jack McGraw) a pea-green pipsqueak who after cautiously tumbling out of his shell grows into a wee gentle giant."

�� to put it kindly have had their ups and downs. From humble beginnings (and an improbable best picture Oscar beating out ���All the President��s Men �� ���Network�� and ���Taxi Driver��) the series rose in the 1980s to heights of grandiosity and preposterousness before stumbling into irrelevance. But don��t call ���Creed�� a comeback. After the folly of ���Rocky Balboa �� the former champ is out of the ring for good. He��s taken up the role essential to the genre of the gruff grizzled trainer. And Sylvester Stallone while happy to steal a scene every now and then cedes the limelight to Michael B. Jordan." he is turned away from his father��s former gym. No one in Los Angeles will go against Mary Anne��s wishes and allow her adopted son to participate in the sport that killed her husband. What else can Adonis do? He travels to Philadelphia where Rocky (Mr. Stallone as if that needed saying) is running a restaurant and keeping a low profile. He��s all done with boxing but Adonis persuades him to give it one more try. They start training and before long a shot at the title materializes a classic mismatch with a British brawler named Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew).  Like Rocky himself almost 40 years earlier Adonis is a designated tomato can  for a superior fighter." �� as the familiar fanfare of Bill Conti��s beloved ���Rocky�� score signaled the start of the final round of the big fight the audience burst into spontaneous applause. This was no sneak-preview crowd primed with free admission and popcorn but a room full of critics and journalists armored in professional skepticism. A cynic might say that the cheering was a Pavlovian reflex set off by a piece of commercial entertainment in the hands of a skilled manipulative director. This cynic however was too busy choking up and clapping to form the thought." Rocky��s erstwhile nemesis and eventual best friend the young man is unsure whether to embrace or spurn the legacy of a father he never knew. He calls himself Adonis (or sometimes Donnie) Johnson and his background is a complicated tangle of deprivation and privilege. He grew up in foster homes and juvenile detention centers before being adopted by Apollo��s widow Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad) who raised him in Los Angeles opulence and kept him away from the boxing ring." whether by coincidence or by the mysterious movements of the dialectic a bunch of semi-dormant franchises have come roaring back to pop-cultural life enrolling legions of new fans and managing both to transcend and to exploit the nostalgia of Gen-X old-timers. There was ���Mad Max: Fury Road�� and then ���Jurassic World.�� The next ���Star Wars�� arrives in a few weeks. In the meantime we have ���Creed �� which writes another chapter in the saga of Rocky Balboa and which is something that Italian Stallion��s devotees have not seen in a long time perhaps since the original ���Rocky�� way back in 1976: a terrific boxing movie." too. The older fighter is a mentor and a father figure to be sure but he also needs someone to take care of him especially when illness adds a melodramatic twist to the plot. Rocky has reconciled himself to loss. The people he loved ��� Paulie Mickey Creed and Adrian ��� are all gone." notwithstanding the effective brutality of the fight scenes. It is a pleasure to watch Mr. Stallone amble through a movie with nothing much to prove. He is at his best when he works comfortably within his limitations as an actor. Mr. Jordan��s limitations in contrast have yet to be discovered. With every role he seems to delight in the unfolding of his talent and to pass his excitement along to the audience." (metaphorical) guts and (discreet) sex. Running time: 2 hours 13 minutes." �� directed by Ryan Coogler from a script he wrote with Aaron Covington is self-aware without being cute about it. In the movie as in the world beyond it Rocky is part of the cultural tapestry. Everyone in Philadelphia knows him. There��s even a statue! But Mr. Coogler a 29-year-old filmmaker whose debut was ���Fruitvale Station�� (also starring Mr. Jordan) looks at the Rocky story and the tradition of Hollywood pugilism through a fresh prism." soothingly old-fashioned and bracingly up-to-date. The punches fly the music soars (hip-hop along with Ludwig Goransson��s variations on the old Bill Conti brass) and the ground is prepared for ���Creed II.�� We��ll see how that goes. But for now it is sweet to have this lesson in the importance of fast footwork brute power and brotherly love." �� like ���Fruitvale Station �� embeds its drama in the perils and pleasures of black life in America. Adonis is a complex character with a complex fate. He is at once a rich kid and a street kid the proud carrier of an illustrious heritage and an invisible man." and also a fable for an era of racial backlash. Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers was the heavy in that movie and Rocky was the noble underdog. Later they set aside their differences and faced a common Soviet enemy as the series turned its attention to Cold War geopolitics. By then Apollo was the sidekick and the sacrificial friend an injustice that ���Creed �� by its very title seeks to redress." Adonis falls for a lovely Philadelphian a musician named Bianca (Tessa Thompson) who schools him in the local cuisine and the local slang. (���What��s a jawn?�� he asks her over cheese steaks.) She teases him for having a white uncle (Adonis��s nickname for Rocky is Unk) and gets mad when she finds out that Adonis has been hiding the truth about his pedigree."

in turn is played with a lot of physical dash and a crazed smile by James McAvoy who all but hurls himself into the fray. He and Mr. Radcliffe make a fine pair of scoundrel-heroes particularly after Victor rescues Igor from the circus and performs an amusingly revolting operation featuring a siphon and bucket of pus before shooing him off for a shower and a shave. Igor cleans up nicely and then with a back brace straightens out agreeably becoming Victor��s well-coiffed match." ���Victor Frankenstein�� has nothing to offer on science and the mysteries of creation but it does reaffirm the grip that Shelley��s story retains on the imagination no matter how far afield it��s taken. (This version was written by Max Landis and directed by Paul McGuigan who also directed episodes of the BBC show ���Sherlock.��) ���Victor Frankenstein�� promises new directions and other movies mostly by recasting a story about gods and monsters into a buddy movie. It��s vaguely cute even if despite the floating eyes and other attractions (notably Jessica Brown Findlay as a trapeze artist) the detective (Andrew Scott best known as Moriarty in ���Sherlock��) who tries to ruin Victor��s party can��t help turning your thoughts from Shelley to Doyle." though plenty of filmmakers have. In ���Son of Frankenstein�� (1939) the assistant is called Ygor and somewhat confusingly in terms of monster genealogy played by Bela Lugosi of Dracula immortality. He��s Igor here in this new movie and played by Daniel Radcliffe who continues to take on roles that seem calculated to stick a fork in Harry Potter as deeply as possible. Hunched and filthy Mr. Radcliffe��s Igor enters head down and cowering more beast than man. A whipped dog Igor works as the lowest-level circus performer a job that mostly entails his serving as the center attraction in a brutal round of kick the can." Igor also turns out to be a genius of a kind an expert draftsman and amateur sawbones who��s eager to help Victor with some of his dodgier scientific experiments." especially when there��s franchise money to be made. This doubtless explains ���Victor Frankenstein �� a pop romp that exhumes Mary Shelley��s famous monster-maker for a jaunty bromance with his bestie Igor. It��s a hyperventilated resurrection that owes less to Shelley (or most Frankenstein flicks) than to Guy Ritchie��s Sherlock Holmes diversions which turned Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) into 19th-century action heroes complete with cheerfully deployed violence and self-regarding smiles."

though that New Yorker cartoons are meant to induce knowing chortles rather than guffaws. And this conventional wisdom is only slightly upended in this breezy and informative documentary directed by Leah Wolchok which opens in New York this week for an Oscar-nomination-qualifying run before airing on HBO on Dec. 7." however are abundant and scintillating moments abound: Mr. Mankoff��s body language in a cartoon-selection meeting with the editor in chief David Remnick is intriguing to say the least. And while a few interview subjects determinedly comment on the magazine��s push toward diversity in the cartoon department the scene in which a new wunderkind is revealed as a wispy pale wide-eyed British man who speaks so softly with Mr. Mankoff that subtitles are needed is almost too perfect." Bob Mankoff and profiles of prominent cartoonists (Roz Chast is the first woman to show up 20 minutes in) the movie covers a lot. If you��ve ever been curious as to how a cartoonist gets into The New Yorker and what happens then ���Very Semi-Serious�� offers very satisfactory info. (For instance no most cartoonists don��t make a living solely from their work for the magazine.) The alacrity of the film though proves a small but potent liability when a personal tragedy in Mr. Mankoff��s life comes up and is practically shuffled off screen."

in its bottom-line fashion a rejoinder to another intolerant regime that of a movie industry that continues to treat women on and off the screen as a distraction an afterthought and a problem. A few months into its run the second installment ���Catching Fire �� became the first movie with a lone female lead to top the annual domestic box office in four decades. That��s astonishing because it reveals the historical depths of the industry��s inequities even while it speaks to the audience��s embrace of this series. There are all sorts of reasons that viewers have flocked to these movies including the studio hard sell but I like to think the numbers prove that in rallying to Katniss��s side they��re also backing the other liberation struggle she has come to represent." the you-go-and-fight girl who has led the empowerment charge at the box office and in the public imagination often while slinging a bow and arrow borrowed from Diana the Roman goddess of the hunt. It wasn��t long before Katniss was making more like a latter-day Athena the Greek goddess of war even as this very human girl-woman was also suggesting a vibrant new take on the American Adam. You may not know the name but you know the type: He��s the hero whom the critic R. W. B. Lewis in his 1955 study of 19th-century literature (and an ���American mythology��) described as being ���emancipated from history happily bereft from ancestry untouched and undefiled by the usual inheritances of family and race.��" their casting ensured that in the movies just as in the books Katniss was never going to be upstaged by a love interest. ���The Hunger Games�� may have shocked readers and viewers with its child-on-child violence but even more startling and certainly far more pleasurable has been the girl-woman at its center who can lead troops like a reborn Joan of Arc yet find time to nuzzle the downy lips of her male comrades before returning to battle. Her desire is as fluid as her gender whether she��s slipping into froufrou shooting down enemy aircraft kissing a boy or taking a punch. Unlike a lot of screen heroines she has never settled into stereotype which despite the whole dystopian thing makes her a lot like the contemporary girls and women watching her." self-reliant ���fundamentally innocent�� ��� the illusion of freedom he enjoys is meaningful Lewis argues because it makes for fiction capable of ���profound tragic understanding�� rather than hopelessness. Even inadequately this Adam struggles because as with his biblical namesake ���the world and history lay all before�� him; by contrast these lay all behind Katniss who has endured history violence and death. Yet she goes forth into her world because she too has an illusion of freedom one which has spared us the nihilism polluting too many movies and has meant that she is neither Adam nor Eve but something else. And it is only by being this something else (not the Girl not the Virgin or the Whore) that she has been able both to love and to fight including against the big bad patriarch." yes of course Katniss is back just as promised by the clumsy title of her last movie ���The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1.�� In ���Part 2 �� she has returned as destined to finish the fight defeat the enemy and send off a big-screen series that has had an astonishing run both in cold-cash terms and in its meaningful symbolism. She��s ready. Since 2012 when the first movie landed Katniss has grown into her role as a savior an evolution that parallels that of Ms. Lawrence who entered the series as a Sundance starlet and leaves it as one of the biggest stars in the world. Both have grown exponentially rising to the demands of their loving audience." including her family friends and other Hunger Games combatants. Some of this can be chalked up to casting and together with Ms. Lawrence Ms. Malone Natalie Dormer Patina Miller and Michelle Forbes make one of the toughest groups of women to band together on screen since Quentin Tarantino��s ���Death Proof �� his ode to exploitation cinema and its chicks. This series has had its share of robust male assistance (notably from Mr. Sutherland and Woody Harrelson) but it��s been distracting and at times more than a little amusing that Katniss��s love interests are played by the blindingly bland brotherhood of Mr. Hutcherson and Mr. Hemsworth." ���Part 2�� was directed by Francis Lawrence who like most franchise filmmakers was not hired for the quality of his mise-en-sc��ne but for one job: to not screw up an extremely valuable property. (The first was shepherded by Gary Ross whose cinematographer Tom Stern alas also departed the series.) And so mission accomplished largely with a lot of conversational face-offs and regular bursts of showy violence that sometimes turn panoramic allowing you to admire the scale of the apocalyptically dressed sets. To that instrumental end the actors hit their marks while running and gunning amid the gray rubble and black ooze although Mr. Lawrence does raise some nice shivers in a tunnel sequence making the horrific most out of the dark." the warrior who has led the charge against oppression in ���The Hunger Games�� movies can ever return to her current incarnation. Even if she and her world are rebooted back into franchise existence by a ravenous studio her moment was now. Katniss as played by Jennifer Lawrence over three years and four blockbusters has evolved from a backwoods scrapper in the first movie into a battle-scarred champion and an exemplar of female power on screen and off ��� and the battles she��s fought have extended far beyond the fictional nation of Panem." love and bullets pegged to a girl-woman who fights for her family her friends and the future. It��s aspirational and inspirational personal and communal familiar and strange and it speaks to the past as well as the present sometimes unnervingly so. Suzanne Collins who wrote the books took her cues from reality television the Iraq war Roman gladiator games and the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur and then filtered her influences through a heroine who embodies the adage that it��s better to die on your feet than live on your knees. The result was a great character on the page and a transcendent one on the screen where women tend to be sidelined or trapped in the virgin-whore divide." with Katniss and the rest of the rebel forces closing in on the government and Panem��s leader President Snow (the invaluable Donald Sutherland leading with an insouciant self-amused smile). There are no real surprises though many familiar faces some of whom (Jeffrey Wright and more movingly Philip Seymour Hoffman) flash by so quickly that they feel like guests who have popped in only to say goodbye. As with a lot of contemporary franchises this one stocked the supporting roles with veterans who have given ballast to a largely unmemorable young cast including the insipid twosome ��� Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale ��� who have wanly bookended Katniss from the start." and because the movies have stayed true to that original conception. At once a hunter and a nurturer Katniss is tough and teary stoic and sentimental which give her layers that reflect her changeable inner states as well as her public and private identities as daughter sister lover and leader. It��s instructive that she��s worn her most overtly glamour-girl outfits as part of the farcical role forced on her by the totalitarian government that rules Panem having been dolled up with makeup and smiles for the televised sideshows that accompany the murderous games of the series title. She��s since graduated to basic battle black or unisex clothing that��s suggestive of a Dystopian Gap." one that��s by turns similar enough to ours to be reassuring and different enough to be diverting. What makes the material still feel personal ��� other than the yearslong investment and love that transform entertainments into fan communities ��� is the combination of Katniss and Ms. Lawrence who have become a perfect fit. Ms. Lawrence now inhabits the role as effortlessly as breathing partly because like all great stars she seems to be playing a version of her ���real�� self. It��s the kind of realness that can give you and the movie a jolt as in a scene with Ms. Lawrence and a sensationally raw Jena Malone that thrusts it into that place where heroes and villains give way to something like life."

Running time: 1 hour 37 minutes." ���Mustang�� is a stunning debut feature by Deniz Gamze Erg�_ven about five sisters in rural Turkey. Confined to their grandmother��s house the girls bridle against losing their freedoms in a story grounded in both laughter and tears and above all in the resilient strength of these girls against soul-deadening strictures." though Ms. Erg�_ven also shows how marriage can be happy when some choice is involved. People outside the family also emerge as oases of modern attitudes along with an escape plan. But the girls�� heroism lies in being themselves and making noise against their immediate society��s wishes." who was born in Turkey brings deft timing and an unapologetic appreciation of beauty to the story qualities missing from other schematic portrayals of clashes with traditional mores Turkish or otherwise. Feather-light camerawork by David Chizallet and Ersin Gok is matched by a nimble screenplay written by Ms. Erg�_ven with Alice Winocour. The ensemble of young actresses is a constantly restless and real presence the perspective filtered mostly through the cheeky Lale but also through the group as a loving crew." the narrator and her four sisters ��� ages extending into the teenage years ��� was to romp with boys at the beach on the last day of school.

but it is a curiously rare occurrence in art which tends to split desire into subject and object. Poetry traces a vector from lover to beloved. (���Shall I compare thee to a summer��s day?��) In painting and sculpture the eye of the beholder lingers on the face and body of the beheld. Students of film are schooled in the erotic power of the gaze and readers of romance fiction know the seductions of the first-person narrative and the free indirect style which concentrate lust and longing within a single consciousness. (���Reader I married him.��)" though and more than a touch of film noir. ���Carol�� filters a relatively happy romance through layers of anxiety dread and psychological suspense. Mr. Haynes a scholar of mid- and late-20th-century cinematic styles and sexual attitudes is both a connoisseur and a theorist of female suffering. In early shorts like ���Superstar�� and ���Dottie Gets Spanked�� as well as in mature features like ���Safe �� ���Far From Heaven�� and ���Mildred Pierce �� his attention has often gravitated toward women in danger and in distress." full-grown matron but Ms. Mara refuses to be the ing�nue in the arrangement. She is vulnerable and hungry timid and ferocious predator and prey. And the movie with its gauzy grainy images (shot by the incomparable Edward Lachman) ultimately depends on the clarity of Therese��s vision on her ability to discover who she is and to choose a course of action that expresses that identity." her dazzling and mysterious allure. But Therese has mysteries of her own. Carol (in a line taken directly from the book) likens her to an alien a creature ���flung from space �� and Ms. Mara��s face has a spooky otherworldly quality. Dressed in mismatched plaids including a dumpy yellow tam-o��-shanter ��� a notable contrast to Carol��s compact and deep-hued pillbox hats ��� Therese can look elfin and childlike. It��s hard to tell whether her quiet manner bespeaks timidity or terrifying self-possession." what do they see? In the opening scene ��� which establishes most of what follows as a flashback ��� we accompany an anonymous hat-and-coated fellow into a hotel bar where he spots the two women (played by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara) at a nearby table. The meaning of their togetherness is invisible to this guy (he��s an acquaintance of Therese��s) and for the moment opaque to us. Later when the scene is repeated with the camera in a different position the current of feeling passing between Carol and Therese as they chat over their teacups is so strong that the air around them seems to vibrate." �� like virtually every other movie Mr. Haynes has directed is a period film almost fetishistically precise in its recreation of the look and sound of the past. Like other historical fiction it measures the distance between then and now. In 1952 the candid and sympathetic depiction of gay life was shocking; now it is commonplace. ���Carol�� might have been content to be an archaeology of the closet or a pitying backward glance at the mores of a less enlightened time." and also more weighed down by compromises and responsibilities. Carol in the middle of divorcing her bewildered husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) has a young daughter and what used to be called a past. A sexual relationship with an old friend named Abby (Sarah Paulson) contributed to the breakup of her marriage and Carol��s romance with Therese adds further complication at a tricky time in her life." we are in on their secret and accustomed to seeing them in public places hidden in plain sight cloaked in unspoken assumptions that are at once painful and protective. We also know the extent of their intimacy since we��ve watched it blossom from a chance encounter and a series of cautious conversations into a headlong heedless affair. In this film��s version of the 1950s nobody necessarily suspects that two women out for coffee or cocktails or a drive in the country might in fact be lovers." the consequences can be unfathomably cruel. Shame exposure and ostracism lurk in every stranger��s glance. A rumor can ruin a life. Terror hovers in the air along with yearning but Mr. Haynes honors Highsmith��s decision to tell a tale of same-sex love stripped of pathology or tragedy." who calls her Terry wants to marry her or at least take her to Europe. Another nice guy Dannie (John Magaro) also has his eye on her. She is patient with them as Carol tries to be with Harge and they are puzzled by her lack of interest." the distraught diva in this picture can only be Carol who is played with almost metaphysical movie-star blondness by Ms. Blanchett. Arrayed in full-cut coats and accessorized in bright saturated colors ��� an early shot lingers over the pulsating orange hues of her fingernails her scarf and her hat ��� Carol is postwar glamour incarnate." of the unspoken and invisible traces of the libido. In one scene Carol helps Therese apply perfume instructing her to spray it only on her pulse points where the heat and movement of her blood will activate the scent. The images in ���Carol�� are cool and elusive but they also pulsate with life." ���The Price of Salt �� published under the pseudonym Claire Morgan uses these conventional methods to tell the story of what was at the time a scandalously unconventional love. That story which begins in Manhattan just before Christmas is related from the perspective of Therese Belivet a young theatrical set designer in New York who falls for an older suburban housewife named Carol Aird. Therese��s infatuation with Carol is immediate and total. Carol��s feelings while equally intense are more elusive partly because the reader experiences them at second hand from Therese��s point of view." �� Todd Haynes has as filmmakers will changed a few details characters and plot points. (Therese is now an aspiring photographer though still temporarily employed at the doll counter of a department store.) But Mr. Haynes and the screenwriter Phyllis Nagy have also done something more radical. In Highsmith��s prose desire is a one-way street. For Mr. Haynes it��s a two-way mirror. At once ardent and analytical cerebral and swooning ���Carol�� is a study in human magnetism in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama the film is a symphony of angles and glances of colors and shadows. It gives emotional and philosophical weight to what might be a perfectly banal question: What do these women see each in each other?"

When it��s over you��ll suspect that transcendent sex ��� preferably at sunset beneath oodles of gauze ��� is more critical to realizing your dreams than a high school diploma." but it��s also painfully superficial. A hint of the tension between Sangaile and her mother (the lovely Jurate Sodyte) a regretful former ballerina remains unplumbed as do the lovers�� clear class differences. Choosing height over depth Dominique Colin��s stunning cinematography slides over treetops and adolescent skin giving buttery daylight and fuzzy twilight a fairy tale magic.

The screenplay struggles to parallel Jess��s bottomless grief and bitterness with Ray��s still-simmering passion for Claire.

she pulls the movie in one direction (bad Krays bad) even as they and the mighty Mr. Hardy effortlessly yank it back.

That at least is how Mr. Helgeland plays it dropping in lightly funny exchanges ��� as when Ronnie bluntly announces his homosexuality to a startled American gangster ��� with the Krays�� dirtier dealings. Yet while those get filthy and sometimes sanguineous it��s notable that the scariest Kray is their mother (a terrific Jane Wood sliding in and out of the movie like a shiv)." the Krays�� most lasting contribution may have been cinematic. Duncan Campbell writing in The Guardian has zeroed in on a 1965 David Bailey photo of the Krays as a defining moment for the twins and their cultural impact. ���The portrait became gangland��s Mona Lisa ��� copied pirated and imitated it was central to their image and their brand �� he writes. Soon afterward Mr. Bailey released a photo collection  that featured the Krays as well as a third brother Charlie alongside boldface names like Mick Jagger and Jean Shrimpton. The Krays were cool only by proxy but they became celebrities of a kind and their look filtered into the gangster film iconography inspiring the likes of Guy Ritchie. Every time you see another stupid thug playing the peacock blame them." but Mr. Helgeland has gone for broad not profound. That shifts the burden to Mr. Hardy who lightly hoists it with grimaces body language an apparent prosthetic and lots of swirling cigar and cigarette smoke. Mr. Hardy is one of those actors who periodically like to pull a Lon Chaney (silent cinema��s man of a thousand faces) by hiding in plain sight. He��s done bald and bulky blond and sleek; more perversely he has masked his face with beard fuzz and appliances. Here he plays a long game of performance peekaboo parading his good looks around as Reggie and hiding them as Ronnie. As a character study it proves about as deep as Goofus and Gallant in the British underworld but it��s also consistently fun to watch." �� a gangster flick in which he does double duty as Ronnie and Reggie Kray the British gangster twins who had a moment in the 1960s. Outside Britain the Krays are probably now known less for their actual exploits than for their representations either as vaguely obscured supporting attractions (in Mike Hodges��s dazzling 1971 genre-defining ���Get Carter �� starring Michael Caine) or as the main event (notably the 1990 biopic ���The Krays �� with Gary and Martin Kemp of Spandau Ballet fame). The Krays weren��t especially memorable as criminals but they knew how to strut and swing through 1960s London." �� that milieu with its flirty skirts and tight suits swoony rides and tuneful hits appears to have been the main impetus driving the writer and director Brian Helgeland. Along with his team he has kitted out the movie handsomely from the sea-foam green Lincoln that glides through the East End like a pampered shark to the floral-choked wallpaper that lines the brothers�� ancestral home like pressed funeral flowers. (The director of photography is Dick Pope who paints the scene with warm dark colors while the eye-soothing and -poking production design is by Tom Conroy.)

�� a new movie directed by Patricia Riggen from a screenplay by Mikko Alanne Craig Borten and Michael Thomas revisits the episode effectively stirring up those emotions all over again and adding some new ones inspired by the lives of the miners and the challenge of bringing them out alive. In some ways it��s foolproof material ��� moving and suspenseful even if you know the outcome. But Ms. Riggen a Mexican-born filmmaker whose earlier features include ���La Misma Luna�� and ���Girl in Progress �� has grappled with some formidable challenges including the familiarity of the story. She also faced something of a numbers problem: 33 potential protagonists ��� as well as wives sisters children government officials and engineers ��� is an awful lot to keep track of. To make matters trickier most of those characters spend an awful lot of time confined in a small stubbornly uncinematic space not doing anything very dramatic." a moralized version of reality. ���The 33�� sends out feelers in a lot of different directions. The circus outside the mine ��� the souvenir stands and cameras the grandstanding politicians and opportunistic show business types ��� hints at a satire of modern media excess a variation on the themes of Billy Wilder��s ���Ace in the Hole.�� The plot sometimes wobbles between the personal and procedural sides of the miners�� plight but both the science and the sentiment feel a little thin." the captain of the shift but the actual leader is Mario (Antonio Banderas) a charismatic and persuasive guy who rations food rallies morale and refuses to give up hope when things look grim. The other miners supply comic relief and dramatic interest. Dar�_o (Juan Pablo Raba) is an alcoholic comforted in his worst moments by Jos� (Marco Trevi�o) a devout Christian. One man is about to become a father for the first time. Another is a few weeks from retirement. The Elvis impersonator (Jacob Vargas) teases the only Bolivian (Tenoch Huerta) in the group. Everyone teases Yonni (Oscar Nu�ez) because of his complicated love life." though they can sometimes be shamed into acting in your interest. Better to put your trust in the Almighty and in the solidarity of your fellow workers." throat-constricting score (one of the last he composed before his death in June) ���The 33�� holds your attention and pushes the required buttons. It starts above ground at an outdoor party where miners eat drink dance impersonate Elvis Presley and engage in some necessary preliminary exposition. By the time they pile into the bus for work the next morning we are acquainted with the most important figures. Once the earth shifts and a giant rock seals them into a refuge hundreds of feet down we know the function each one will play." and delivers a strong and timely moral. ���God was with us�� the miners write on the wall of their refuge as they prepare to return to the sunlight and at several points the movie emphasizes the importance of religion in their lives. This seems like a faith-inflected movie for the age of a Latin American populist pope a parable of spiritual endurance with an eye on social and economic iniquities. Before the credits roll we learn that the miners were never compensated for their suffering and that the mining company was cleared of any negligence a judgment the film emphatically challenges. We also learn that the 33 whose real-life faces fill the screen at the very end ���remain brothers to this day.��" who include Dar�_o��s sister (Juliette Binoche) and Mario��s wife (Kate del Castillo). Their presence puts pressure on the Chilean government represented by a handsome young minister of mining (Rodrigo Santoro) and the portly silver-haired president (Bob Gunton). The government minister and an engineer (Gabriel Byrne) argue about practicalities and about how long to keep drilling to find the missing men." viewers across the world followed the progress of the rescue efforts thanks to round-the-clock news media attention. We breathed sighs of relief and wept tears of joy when the men finally emerged after more than two months in subterranean heat and darkness.

It is too busy preparing for its repellent money shots." �� Paul Bettany��s overwrought cri de coeur about homelessness in New York City show its characters desperately navigating the city��s overstressed shelter system. These grim scenes filmed in shades of brown and gray suggest the combination of fear exhaustion and uncertainty in people at the mercy of an impersonal bureaucracy that shuffles them from place to place. But the movie never bothers to show you life inside a shelter dormitory or tries to convey a broader vision of the city��s street culture. It is too busy showcasing its star Jennifer Connelly (Mr. Bettany��s wife) in degrading situations." Hannah shoots heroin into her crotch. Another finds her trying to go cold turkey with very messy results. In the film��s most miscalculated maneuver she trades sexual favors with a building superintendent in return for cramped space in a boiler room during a blizzard. ���This is New York �� the superintendent smugly declares. ���It��s not a something-for-nothing town.�� It recalls the actress��s nightmarish turn in Darren Aronofsky��s ���Requiem for a Dream �� in which she and another woman are paid to perform together at a party." Hannah is a heroin addict whose family has given up on her. Mr. Bettany��s sketchy unconvincing screenplay is more interested in Ms. Connelly��s execution of exploitative stunts than in seriously examining the social crisis it purports to lament.

�� which starts lightly enough with Vanessa and Roland��s moving into a French hotel nestled in a Mediterranean cove seemingly used only by a single diligent fisherman and a few desultory extras. (Malta plays the South of France if not especially convincingly.) There they set up house with piles of Louis Vuitton luggage and bottles of booze and pills as well as a red manual typewriter. A novelist Roland has come to the hotel to work but ends up spending most of his time at the local bar his pen impotently hovering over white pages while Vanessa lounges in and out of bed her ruined eye makeup streaking her wet face like black tears. These salty pearls are the foundation for the story that she will write one monumental tear at a time." she has no problem making you wait. But she��s also clearly working within the idiom of the classic art film including through her deployment of narrative and character ambiguity. (The catchy soundtrack includes a song from Chantal Goya the y�-y� pop star of Jean-Luc Godard��s ���Masculin F�minin.��) Vanessa��s tears may be personal (and explained in one of the least persuasive scenes) but they flow from the same wellspring that has given us the female tears and snot that have streamed through art cinema since at least Carl Theodor Dreyer��s ���The Passion of Joan of Arc.��" at times destabilizing act when a woman both directs and puts herself on camera simply because it upends (still!) the historical balance in which men paint and shoot the pictures. The persistence of that inequity (and the world��s comfort with that imbalance) is one reason that it��s a creative choice when male directors and critically sanctioned artists like Miranda July turn the camera on themselves but mere vulgar vanity when the popular likes of Barbra Streisand does. For her part Ms. Jolie Pitt a woman of well-publicized extremes isn��t content to merely parade around on screen; from shot to shot she makes herself a full-scale cinematic spectacle all but forcing her image on you. And then she does what you least expect: She surprises you by shifting Vanessa��s gaze ��� and yours ��� to the hot couple next door." man does she know how to make an entrance. Supremely self-aware Ms. Jolie Pitt introduces her marrieds ��� Vanessa and Roland ��� like the international movie stars they��re played by with the two roaring into the picture in a silver Citro�n convertible with Mr. Pitt behind the wheel. They look as glamorous as a Vanity Fair spread he in his sporty mustache and porkpie hat and she in an animal-print hat the size of a beach umbrella. It��s the kind of statement accessory that you can imagine Elizabeth Taylor upstaging when she went tootling around with her husband Richard Burton back when they were co-starring on screen and off as the world��s most famous couple." �� including with the audience��s patience and its laughter and it proves far more adventurous than her previous feature as a director ���Unbroken �� a dully hagiographic biopic about the Olympian Louis Zamperini. Despite some early flashes of levity ���By the Sea�� seems as if it��s terminally (and unconsciously) headed into self-parody or climes as grim as her earlier films when it takes an abrupt unexpectedly witty and notionally perverse turn. (Her feature directing debut was the war movie ���In the Land of Blood and Honey.��) One day Vanessa notices a sizable hole in the hotel room leans into it like a distaff Norman Bates and begins spying on the young newlyweds next door (M�lanie Laurent and Melvil Poupaud as Lea and Fran�_ois) an interest that evolves into a passion that she later shares with Roland." ���By the Sea�� stars Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt as itinerant married artists who are suffering beautifully through a rough patch. Any resemblance to real life is strictly coincidental and completely intentional. At first luxurious blush it��s a jet-setting marital melodrama one of those he-said she-said (and wept) encounter sessions decked with designer shades to-die-for digs and millionaire tears. More interestingly the movie which Ms. Jolie Pitt wrote and directed is a knowing or at least a ticklishly amusing demonstration of celebrity and its relay of gazes from one of the most looked-at women in the world. Take watch she seems to say this is my body." the story such as it is switches over to Roland who does most of his drinking eating and not-writing in the company of the amiable barman Michel (the great French actor Niels Arestrup) and the less voluble hotel owner Patrice (Richard Bohringer another welcome French face). Ms. Jolie Pitt may be married to one of the world��s most famous men but despite an occasional beauty shot of Mr. Pitt she doesn��t showcase him as an object of desire. For a long initial stretch he instead plays the cozy intimate role of the seemingly weary inattentive husband sometimes with stubble and boxer shorts at other times with a perfunctory goodbye or a slammed door. Given Vanessa��s waterworks it��s hard not to feel for the guy." she turns Lea and Fran�_ois into the movie��s other Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt: the sexy teasingly elusive and insistently watched couple who are often seen through a peephole that hides as much as it reveals. It��s a surprisingly funny spiky development partly because it transforms Vanessa into a voyeur and a ravenous one at that. Lea and Fran�_ois evolve into a marital aid for Vanessa and Roland but with complications as the peephole becomes a narrative rabbit hole leading to old hurts. That Vanessa is however also an audience member a moviegoer of a type becomes even clearer when the (unsurprising) tragic root of her tears is revealed a disclosure that can be read as an acid commentary on those who watch desire and live through others. Ms. Jolie Pitt may not mind if you look ��� but watch out!" sometimes while framed in a window of the hotel and generally while dressed in one of her black or white negligees. Working with the excellent cinematographer Christian Berger Ms. Jolie Pitt seems to be giving her audience exactly what it demands on screen and off: herself. In medium shots and close-ups in daytime and night she turns her face and body (or rather Vanessa��s) into a landscape of classic feminine suffering becoming our latest cinematic lady of perpetual misery. In one shot Vanessa stands at a window smoking her eyes hidden behind her oversize Yves Saint Laurent glasses; in another she sits on a bed eyes shiny and unfocused; in another she stretches out catlike on a chair until her body fills the frame from coifed head to perfect toe." just around the time Liz and Dick were starring in ���Divorce His Divorce Hers �� a marital made-for-TV drama that like some of the big-screen films they made together played on the similarities between the actors and their characters. (Their lives imitated fiction again when they announced their separation after the movie��s broadcast.) It��s impossible to imagine Ms. Jolie Pitt rip-roaring it up in public like Taylor who lived her life out loud as she perfected playing Elizabeth Taylor the role of a lifetime. Ms. Jolie Pitt by contrast like others in her elite Madonna-schooled sorority (Beyonc� et al.) has been engaged in an exceptionally skilled version of celebrity peekaboo for some time ��� now you see the ���real�� her now you don��t."

Toward the end of her life when her daughter Isabella Rossellini asked why she had kept so many letters diaries photos and other mementos Bergman responded with consummate movie-star sang-froid: ���I always knew I was going to be famous.�� (She died in 1982 at 67.)

To that upbeat end it tends to soften and even elide some of the thornier passages in Bergman��s life including her painful public break with her first husband Mr. Lindstrom with whom she had a child Pia Lindstrom.

He rubs shoulders with an unctuous church P.R. guy (Paul Guilfoyle) and plays golf with a well-connected lawyer (Jamey Sheridan) who handled some of the archdiocese��s unsavory business. The reporters working for Robby ��� Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) and Matt Carroll (Brian d��Arcy James) ��� come from Catholic backgrounds and have their own mixed feelings about what they��re doing." confusion and compromise as anyone else. Before 2001 ��� with some exceptions notably in the work of the columnist Eileen McNamara (played here in a few cursory scenes by Maureen Keiller) ��� the paper overlooked both the extent of the criminality in the local church and the evidence that the hierarchy knew what was going on. The Spotlight reporters and editors are pursuing a big potentially career-making scoop.

But the image of two prominent men talking quietly behind closed doors ��� Law is played with orotund charm by Len Cariou Baron with sphinxlike self-containment by Liev Schreiber ��� haunts this somber thrilling movie and crystallizes its major concern which is the way power operates in the absence of accountability. When institutions convinced of their own greatness work together what usually happens is that the truth is buried and the innocent suffer. Breaking that pattern of collaboration is not easy. Challenging deeply entrenched widely respected authority can be very scary." who played a rotten reporter on the last season of ���The Wire �� views journalists primarily through the lens of their work. He follows Pfeiffer as she interviews survivors Rezendes as he wrangles a zealous lawyer (Stanley Tucci) and Carroll as he digs into long-hidden records including articles buried in the newspaper��s archives. Though the film like the Spotlight articles avoids euphemism in discussing the facts of child rape it also avoids exploitative flashbacks balancing attention to individual cases with a sense of pervasive invisible corruption. Baron urges the reporters to focus on the systemic dimensions of the story and ���Spotlight�� does the same. As the number of victims and predators increases and as it becomes clear that Law and others knew what was happening and protected the guilty shock and indignation are replaced by a deeper sense of moral horror."

Bond��s creator Ian Fleming once said that he wanted 007 to be as he put it ���an extremely dull uninteresting man to whom things happened.�� (Fleming borrowed the name from an ornithologist.) He also wanted Bond to be a ���blunt instrument.�� The spy proved as blunt as an anvil on Wile E. Coyote��s head but the casting of Mr. Connery obliterated any notion that Bond could be wholly dull. The Bond movies needed sex to sell their violence especially to a wide audience and Mr. Connery was the ideal salesman." there��s the usual narrative busywork that plays as if it were written by committee which it was (John Logan Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth). If you have watched one Bond movie you know the score. The band ��� M (Ralph Fiennes) Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) ��� gets back together with Bond singing lead. There��s an opening lollapalooza blowout that Mr. Mendes largely delivers in one long silky take having clearly studied trends in contemporary art cinema. Mr. Craig and the camera move together beautifully in this sequence whether Bond��s sauntering across a roof (and in what has become a signature adjusting a shirt cuff) or riding down a collapsing building as easily as you would a slide at a water park." although given the anemic seductresses Bond is often now paired with the actor can scarcely take the blame. A few sashay through ���Spectre �� most agreeably Monica Bellucci cinema��s current go-to Italian bombshell. She shows up in widow��s weeds which Bond promptly removes while she babbles intel about her dead husband. The husband is a nail that leads to the shoe the horse the rider and finally the kingdom little of which has anything to do with the world as it exists with its environmental disasters and political uncertainties religious wars and ordinary terrors. But then it��s hard to imagine Bond taking on say the Islamic State." �� the 24th ���official�� title in the series which is presumably as planned. Much as the perfect is the enemy of good originality is often the enemy of the global box office. And so for the fourth time Mr. Craig has suited up to play the British spy who��s saving the world one kill at a time with Sam Mendes occupying the director��s chair for a second turn. They��re a reasonable fit although their joint seriousness has started to feel more reflexive than honest especially because every Bond movie inevitably shakes off ambition to get down to the blockbuster business of hurling everything ��� bodies bullets fireballs debris money ��� at the screen." of course including car chases nominally exotic locales and a pulpy visceral slugfest on a passenger train with a Bluto-size hurting machine (Dave Bautista) who��s evocative of that old Bond enemy Jaws. The train as well as the purr of an Aston Martin suggests that the filmmakers are working the nostalgia angle though the series has always been driven by longing for other men and worlds for the British Empire for a hyper-masculine savior for sex kittens (friends or foes) and for a reassuring vision of the world in which the greatest threat is an orderly criminal organization run by a single supervillain. The superbaddie in ���Spectre�� is alas a bore enlivened only by our series sentimentality and Christoph Waltz working his accented villainy with a smile." Kingsley Amis attributed the success of the Bond stories partly to what he called the ���Fleming effect �� noting how Bond��s fantastic world ���as well as the temporary local fantastic elements �� are ��� ���bolted down�� to some sort of reality.�� The Bond movies have always managed to tap into reality by switching on a camera a connection to the material world that lingered no matter how far out the villains their wild lairs and intrigues. The current Bond team is trying to keep the audience entertained with new tricks and gizmos while keeping it kind of real which perhaps explains why this Bond sweats buckets tears up and even bares his feelings. Mr. Craig is very good at selling Bond��s humanity though in truth what has always really turned us on isn��t 007��s humanity but the reverse."

though this documentary passes on any deep exploration of the race��s history or cultural significance. Instead Ms. Spender immerses us in its sights and sounds while focusing on the timeless story she finds in the summer of 2013. In a generational confrontation the jockey Gigi Bruschelli winner of 13 Palios and intent on surpassing the record of 14 faces a challenge from his onetime apprentice Giovanni Atzeni. Will the old order give way?" the film ��� shot and scored beautifully ��� is an enthusiastic introduction to this delirious event and its peposo of passion style and intrigue. As the Sienese like to say the Palio is life." but the Italian city of Siena still holds a competition from the Middle Ages that evokes a gladiatorial spirit. The Palio a horse race first recorded in 1238 is a Tuscan feast of civic pride medieval pageantry and Machiavellian strategies." the race run twice every summer in the city��s Piazza del Campo in front of about 70 000 screaming fans is nominally a contest of neighbors: 10 of the city��s contrade or districts sponsor horses and hope to secure bragging rights with a victory.

guts or heart to do this story justice. The blacklist remains vital and lamentably topical and it��s clear why someone thought it was a good time to pull Trumbo back into the limelight. But the man who helped give us ���Gun Crazy �� an American masterpiece among many other titles deserves a smarter portrait. The movie doesn��t just dumb down history it also elides and slides over critical milestones both personal and public as well as the complex ideological divides that turned friends into enemies. Its Trumbo is a charmer who wears his contradictions so lightly you might not notice them despite the occasional ribbing from his friends. You have to wonder if the real Trumbo would recognize him." with its wall-to-wall caricatures its bellowing and mugging (including from Mr. Cranston) and historical reductivism ���Trumbo�� sometimes evokes an old Looney Tunes sendup of Tinsel Town though without the beauty wit visual style or economy. Some of the bellowers offer welcome relief notably John Goodman as Frank King one of the B-movie independents who with his brother Hymie (Stephen Root) gives Trumbo work when the establishment refuses to. Mr. Goodman gooses the movie to life as does Helen Mirren as Hedda Hopper the gossip queen who here ridiculously becomes the embodiment of everything that stinks in Hollywood never mind the titans who ran it." which routinely casts an eye at the big political picture but prefers to narrow in on the more personal story of Trumbo��s struggles at home and at work. To that end there��s the domestic soap involving his loyal loving blandly conceived wife Cleo (Diane Lane) and their three children. Oddly the eldest Niki (Madison Wolfe plays her until Elle Fanning steps in) ends up having more narrative and emotional weight than Cleo. Niki��s prominence smacks of a screenwriting contrivance mostly as a way to paint Trumbo as someone who remained a loving family man despite his ordeals but too often when he explains stuff to his daughter (Dad are you a Communist?) the filmmakers are obviously explaining stuff to the audience." �� an ill-conceived take on one of the most famous targets of the Hollywood blacklist the writer Dalton Trumbo clenches a cigarette holder that juts in the air like a sword. Given that he��s played by Bryan Cranston (���Breaking Bad��) you have hopes that Trumbo will soon be making like Errol Flynn and dashing and slashing through the movie giving it verve excitement. The real Trumbo (1905-1976) was a pistol. A baker-intellectual turned industry insider he was funny barbed and wildly prolific with screen credits that range from ���Kitty Foyle�� to ���Spartacus.�� He was also a Communist which for many made him a traitor the Devil no more than a terrorist." part historical gloss ���Trumbo�� tells a great-man story with a patchwork of fact and fiction mixing in the odd bit of newsreel with a great many dull visually flat and poorly lighted dramatic scenes. Written by John McNamara and directed by Jay Roach it opens in 1947 in Los Angeles where in between shouts of ���Action!�� and ���Cut!�� and the usual wheeling and dealing Hollywood is coming under siege. That was the year that the House Un-American Activities Committee held hearings in both Los Angeles and Washington to look into Communist doings.

The bistros�� patrons may or may not be aware that they��re extras in a Jacques Rivette film. The frequent Rivette star Juliet Berto also swaggers about in the role of a semi-street person working an even more pugnacious grift albeit one whose front she has difficulty maintaining." Jacques Rivette��s 1971 film ���Out 1: Noli Me Tangere�� (the subtitle is Latin for ���touch me not��) is considered as more than one writer has put it a kind of filmic holy grail. The nearly 13-hour work a cinematic soak both sprawling and intimate has been almost impossible to view in the more than 40 years since its production. The movie was screened in New York in 2006 by the Museum of the Moving Image but the two-week engagement at the Brooklyn Academy of Music beginning on Wednesday is its New York theatrical premiere." Mr. Rivette has shown remarkable erudition and to some marked eccentricity. He famously detected moral bankruptcy in a particular camera movement in Gillo Pontecorvo��s 1960 film ���Kap�_ �� and his praise of the much-maligned 1995 Hollywood film ���Showgirls�� spearheaded a critical reappraisal of it at least within the aforementioned circle of cinephiles." in some ways the later work of the director David Lynch. A bit role by Mr. Rivette��s fellow director �ric Rohmer sporting a meticulous Van Dyke beard to better portray a skeptical Balzac scholar is a comic highlight. (���Your poor grasp of reality is matched only by your poor spelling �� Mr. Rohmer��s character tells Colin who has been submitting questions to him in written form.)

Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) ��� the Irish lass whose coming-of-age is the film��s principal interest and reason for being ��� takes an excursion with Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen) her Brooklyn beau. Standing on a windswept patch of grass out on Long Island Tony spins a vision of a nice house and a thriving family plumbing business: a quiet prosperous life beyond the cramped confines of the city. Sitting in the theater the 21st-century viewer can fill in the blanks conjuring a time-lapse picture of the growth of the suburbs and the unfolding of a long marriage. Tony and Eilis grow old before our eyes and the world changes around them. The Dodgers go to Los Angeles. The kids go to college. Some of them eventually move back to Brooklyn." �� a lovely film based on the even lovelier novel by Colm Toibin feels like an answer to that question. Set in its titular borough and in a small Irish town in the early 1950s it is both sharply observed and gently nostalgic." an implied flashback. Nothing in the film takes place in the present but everything in it is carried on an invisible current of imaginative retrospection. Like its literary source the movie directed by John Crowley (���Boy A��) and written by Nick Hornby feels like the result of a child or grandchild��s inquiry into the lives of a previous generation. How did Mom and Dad meet? What were they like? Why did they get married? Where did we come from? It��s quite a tale and also a perfectly ordinary series of events strung together by chance choice and perhaps a touch of grace." but there is a room in a brownstone and a position as a sales clerk waiting for Eilis when she arrives. She is counseled by a benevolent priest (Jim Broadbent) looked after by a sharp-tongued landlady (Julie Walters) and instructed in the ways of American femininity by her supervisor at work (Jessica Par�) and by the other residents of the boardinghouse. After a while Eilis��s loneliness starts to abate. She takes night classes in accounting and does very well. She meets Tony and his Italian-American family who are about one meatball away from being complete ethnic stereotypes but hard to resist for just that reason." really. And it��s also much simpler. ���Brooklyn�� endows its characters with desires and aspirations but not with foresight and it examines the past with open-minded curiosity rather than with sentimentality or easy judgment. Its New York and Irish landscapes are both romantic and constricting. There are streetcars rooming houses and department stores on one side of the ocean tidy shops and dark-paneled pubs on the other. There are also a lot of rules and expectations for young people women in particular. Eilis does not experience these norms as unduly oppressive. They are what she��s used to and also as such the condition of her freedom." places that help supply both a sense of identity and a story of progress ��� complementary answers to the question ���Where do we come from?��" who has grown from an uncannily intelligent child actor into a screen performer of remarkable force and sensitivity. On the page Eilis comes alive through the fineness of Mr. Toibin��s prose. A devotee of Henry James he registers the fluctuations of the character��s inner weather with meteorological precision. Inwardness is a great challenge for filmmakers. The human face is a wall as well as a window. Words lose their power. Everything depends on the ability of actors to communicate nuances of feeling and fluctuations of consciousness." ���Brooklyn�� discovers its plot and reveals the stakes of its heroine��s story. And heroic she is even though her drama is firmly anchored in the mundane. At home she finds familiar comforts and also a new suitor a local boy grown into handsome Domhnall Gleeson. Eilis��s romantic predicament is agonizing for her and also for the viewer. I can��t remember the last time I cared so much about the marital prospects of a fictional character and I don��t think that��s just because it��s in my nature to root for a guy named Tony against a skinny redhead." her eyebrows her breath her teeth her pores ��� to convey a process of change that is both seismic and subtle.

He bookends ���In Jackson Heights�� with parallel extreme long shots of the urban landscape opening with an overhead shot of a daytime street tableau and closing at night with a jewel-like city aglow with bursts of fireworks. In between these paired images he writes an epic of a city its people and the democratic process in tentative and kinetic action." but Mr. Wiseman suggests that that title more rightly belongs to Jackson Heights. The neighborhood a blocky parcel formerly known as Trains Meadows and about 30 minutes by subway from Midtown Manhattan was created in the early 20th century as a suburblike development. The area��s modern history is inscribed in the elevated train (the line opened in 1917) that runs along Roosevelt Avenue its southernmost border and which is glimpsed and heard throughout the movie. Other chapters of that history can be seen in the garden apartment houses that were built in the 1910s and ��20s in the garden homes built after 1924 and in the gaudy storefront signs that today ornament the main commercial strips." famously institutions or as he put it in another 1970s interview ���a series of activities that take place in a limited geographical area with a more or less consistent group of people being involved.�� Those institutions can seem as direct and familiar as the halls and teachers in ���High School�� (1968); other times as in ���Central Park�� (1989) the idea of the institution emerges in the nexus of children��s playgrounds city policies and the public commons. Similarly while ���In Jackson Heights�� is an exploration of a particular neighborhood Mr. Wiseman advances the idea that what makes a city ��� and makes it great ��� are the people in its streets and stores its barbershops and laundromats who together are weaving its cultural social and political fabric." �� Whitman wrote that the genius of America is found in its ���common people�� rather than in its executives or ambassadors colleges or churches. He found an ���unrhymed poetry�� in ���their manners speech dress friendship ��� the freshness and candor of their physiognomy ��� the picturesque looseness of their carriage ��_ their deathless attachment to freedom ��� their aversion to anything indecorous or soft or mean ��� the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states.�� Whitman��s words are a glorious rhapsodic catalog of everyday Americans as well as a poem in their own right one that for the last half-century Mr. Wiseman in documentary after documentary and in his own generous fashion has been expanding on beautifully." dropping you into the ��hood and immersing you in sights and sounds with a succession of harmoniously framed shots of people corners flags (a Brazilian banner ornaments one shot while the Stars and Stripes waves in another) stores and bins of brightly colored vegetables. Working with his longtime cinematographer John Davey Mr. Wiseman also pops into a Muslim school a Jewish center a meeting of gay and transgender people a City Council office and the local headquarters of Make the Road New York an activist organization dedicated to Latino and working-class people. Every so often he pauses a while as someone delivers a song an argument a speech a complaint or a tribute ��� what great talkers he finds!" but Mr. Wiseman isn��t a pedagogue and doesn��t wield a hammer much less a wagging finger. Like anthropologists (or some poets) he studies other people and their behaviors finding meanings in the visible world. Put another way he immerses himself in a world ��� call it his fieldwork ��� observes it closely and brings back the evidence. Crucially to expand on this ethnographic comparison he also edits his documentaries in addition to doing the sound work. ���Cutting a documentary �� he said in the 1970s ���is like putting together a reality dream because the events in it are all true except really they have no meaning except insofar as you impose a form on them and that form is imposed in large measure of course in the editing.��" �� a thrilling transporting love letter from Frederick Wiseman to New York and its multi-everything glory. Set in the Queens neighborhood of its title ��� where people from across the globe are staking a claim on America while speaking Spanish Tibetan and Punjabi ��� Mr. Wiseman��s latest documentary is a movingly principled political look at a dynamic neighborhood in which older waves of pioneers make room for new amid creeping gentrification. It��s an immigration story so it goes without saying that it is also about New York and the United States ��� that ���teeming nation of nations �� to steal a phrase from Walt Whitman." as the movie returns to specific spaces touching on human rights and gentrification along the way it develops into a deeply stirring ode to the immigrant experience and American identity. Each person and storefront sign carries a story opens another world from ���Articulos Cat�_licos�� to ���Himalayan Driving School�� and ���Whole Baby Goat.�� (Animal lovers should be aware that a bird is slaughtered in one scene.) Mostly these stories mingle peacefully despite worried brows and references to past violence as with a shot of the street sign for Edgar Garzon Corner named for a gay man who was beaten to death in 2001 ��� an image that Mr. Wiseman answers with images from a pride march.

It��s mutual loathing at first sight though really it��s foreplay." for the planning and scheming the pulse-quickening pawn-sacrificing brinkmanship. She doesn��t seem especially interested in what Castillo stands for (the movie is only marginally more curious) and her party persuasion remains fuzzy despite nods to her past. Like most American movies about politics ���Our Brand Is Crisis�� plays it straight down the noncommittal middle. In place of an obvious party line it has good intentions and personalities along with a faith in both American democracy and the kind of happy endings that made Mr. Smith��s trip to Washington such a success. It casts a skeptical eye at the gospel of globalization that��s preached by Jane��s team but its outrage is more directed at cynicism than at any specific system." Sandra Bullock doesn��t need to do much to win you over.

With his fat cigars gilded lifestyle and assorted dead civilians cluttering his past Castillo seems to be a very bad man so what��s a nice girl like Jane doing in this campaign? What for that matter is Ms. Bullock?" partly because the filmmakers have a morality lesson to finish selling. That kills the movie but the filmmakers don��t approve of Jane the cynic and don��t want you on her side. The problem is that they and Ms. Bullock do such a good job selling this Jane that they do exactly what they��re supposed to do: They make you curious about her. You want to know how the Janes of the world happen. Is it money? Power? Ideology? You never find out. Instead Jane starts palling around with a young Bolivian idealist with leaky eyes Eddie (Reynaldo Pacheco) which leads to smiles camaraderie and a visit to a slum for some rueful laughs about Adam Smith and the invisible hand. Soon her eyes are shining too and this character study is selling out that character as fast as it can." Pat comes across as a wildly romanticized version of Mr. Carville with Jane suggesting some kind of attenuated version of Mary Matalin the Republican strategist married to Mr. Carville. (Mr. Thornton played a Carville-type figure in ���Primary Colors.��) Ms. Matalin didn��t play a public role in the 2002 Bolivian election and she��s not in the documentary but the filmmakers and their stars have fun with the idea that politics is sex for those who want to keep their clothes on. It��s cute for a while. The stars are pros and their scenes often staged so that the characters are within breathing distance of each other have snap. In moments Mr. Green seems to be trying to turn this into a Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy romance." also titled ���Our Brand Is Crisis.�� Directed by Rachel Boynton it focused on the efforts of a consulting group Greenberg Carville Shrum (whose founders include James Carville) that was hired to help Gonzalo S��nchez de Lozada win the 2002 Bolivian presidential election. Granted remarkable back-room access Ms. Boynton provided an intimate look at how politicians are packaged and sold in elections though instructively the strategists were also true believers. ���We are in this because we not only believe in democracy �� one of the consultants Jeremy D.

The director Mr. Brocka (1939-91) makes the house a patchwork of metal wood and cardboard an early focal point turning it into a microcosm of the sprawl and misery that surround it. Here Insiang lives with her harsh bullying mother Tonya (an excellent Mona Lisa) and a gaggle of relatives that includes a fistful of young children. As Mr. Brocka plays with his framing going from tight to wide putting the scene��s combustibility into stark visual terms he transforms this one family into a pungent city." their bodies creating a confusion of crying and yelling and jagged motion (a cacophony accompanied by Tonya��s continuing tirade) they are all but swallowed up by a neighborhood contingent gathered outside. It��s a raucous seemingly chaotic scene that takes on an abrupt narrative clarity when Tonya insists that two of the children return the clothes that she bought for them a demand that leaves them literally naked. And just like that two more children have joined the ranks of those who are seen wandering and playing amid the garbage. Mr. Brocka likes to go big and blunt but in ���Insiang �� he does his strongest work when he delivers his politics quietly as when Insiang in another scene hangs wet laundry on barbed wire strung outside her house." written by Mario O��Hara and Lamberto Antonio from a novel by Mr. O��Hara is the least of it. The melodramatic machinery kicks in after Mr. Brocka oils it with some grim scene-setting starting with the ghastly image of a pig being gutted in a slaughterhouse filled with screaming dying animals that leads to a documentary portfolio of human squalor ��� all this turns out to be a warm-up for the brutalization of Insiang including by Tonya.

Insiang picks up a little money doing laundry but it��s never enough and one day in a fury Tonya evicts her husband��s relatives." though largely becomes lost among the escalating convolutions and traumas including those connected with a cruel male interloper.

brownstone-lined street Mr. Silva transports us to a much deeper darker place. The word ���gentrification�� is not uttered on screen but the economic and literal violence that lurks within its bland euphemistic syllables turns out to be the movie��s hidden theme. As misunderstandings spiral from awkward to horrifying the gentle tickle of comedy is replaced by the barb of satire and the audience��s smile of recognition is replaced by a grimace of complicity. Mr. Silva starts out with his tongue in his cheek; you may wind up with a fishhook in yours." Polly (Kristen Wiig) is white and Freddy is an immigrant. He��s played by Sebasti��n Silva the 36-year-old Chilean filmmaker who wrote and directed ���Nasty Baby �� a sly comedy that shares its title with Freddy��s art project. Not that anyone makes a big deal about race or sexuality or national background except occasionally to make a knowing careful joke." a moment that turns out to be a turning point in the film��s devilishly clever plot Freddy and his gallerist argue over his version of ���Nasty Baby.�� The gallerist (Neal Huff) had been expecting ���honesty and embarrassment�� and is disappointed to encounter what he perceives as cuteness instead. Mr. Silva��s ���Nasty Baby�� fools you into thinking that it exists on a similar aesthetic boundary line and that its bustling energy is an expression of Mr. Silva��s struggle to stay true to his characters and their environment without making something too stale small or safe." Freddy and Polly ��� and others in their social circle including Freddy��s brother (Agust�_n Silva the director��s brother) Freddy��s assistant (Alia Shawkat a co-producer of the film) and a kindly older neighbor (Mark Margolis) ��� live a specifically Brooklyn version of the good life in which gratifying work nice friends fulfilling leisure and good food are not aspirations but entitlements. Anything that��s missing (like a baby) can be acquired without too much trouble. Or if there is trouble it��s likely to be more amusing than agonizing." and too appealing to be subjected to overt mockery. As a result the humor in ���Nasty Baby�� seems low key and small scale. The movie operates mainly as a comedy of postmodern manners poking at the unexamined sensitivities and tiny contradictions that are part of the daily rhythms of the character��s lives. If bigger issues sometimes intrude ��� racism homophobia money ��� they can be dissolved in irony or smothered in political correctness. City living has its rough spots like the possibly unstable neighbor known as Bishop (Reg E. Cathey) who insists on running his leaf blower at the crack of dawn outside Freddy and Mo��s window. But surely he��s just a harmless local character." right? If Mr. Silva had simply made the movie I��ve tried to describe so far it would be a mild and enjoyable addition to the library of contemporary comedy that includes films like ���Obvious Child�� and ���The Skeleton Twins�� and television like ���Transparent.�� It��s well observed welcoming and affectionate occasionally sharp but never mean. Let me finish though." hand-held style ��� it��s a flurry of ragged scenes shot in shallow-focus digital video with plenty of off-center close-ups and nervous cuts ��� ���Nasty Baby�� presents itself as something familiar. As you might say the kind of movie the people in it might go to see and enjoy with a few of the usual self-conscious reservations. The characters are gratifyingly individual but they are also recognizable 21st-century urban types inhabiting a milieu that is hardly exotic to casual browsers in the meadows of independent cinema and off-network television comedy." anecdotal story turns out to be a carefully constructed narrative machine one that dispenses a brilliantly nasty series of surprises. Mr. Silva��s accomplishment is not just in pulling off a jarring plot twist but in handling a change of tone that turns the movie ��� and the audience��s assumptions about it ��� upside down. If you��ve seen his earlier films like ���The Maid �� ���Old Cats�� or ���Crystal Fairy �� you��re aware that he possesses this skill and also a keen eye for the cruelty that underlies even the most apparently harmonious social arrangements." and the most reliable source of laughter for about an hour is the awkwardness that arises when unspoken boundaries are transgressed. And the work of the diverse good-natured group of people who inhabit this movie is precisely to figure out the rules for living now that the old norms and taboos have gone away. When this happens their world will become an achieved Utopia of tolerance love creativity and coolness. With a crazy real estate market and Byzantine parking rules of course." and Freddy lives with his boyfriend Mo (and also with a skinny scene-stealing cat) in a light-flooded walk-up on a generally quiet Brooklyn block.

Their mission seems beyond futile but don��t count them out too soon: Their leader is Kurt Russell." a witty fusion of western horror and comedy that gallops to its own beat. That rhythm is dictated entirely by the writer and director S. Craig Zahler a novelist and musician who flips genre conventions upside-down and cares more about character than body count. As a result he has given us a horror movie whose monsters are withheld until the tail end of its 132 minutes and an action movie whose longest section involves mostly walking and talking." you can see why actors with the heft of Patrick Wilson and Richard Jenkins were moved to join Mr. Russell in his trek. (���It��s like a tree fell on you �� a bartender remarks to a less-than-coherent patron. ���A redwood.��) Even Matthew Fox whom I have always found underwhelming is terrific as the worldly gunslinger with a creamy wardrobe and an itchy trigger finger. Rising to the bait of the movie��s meandering asides and pithy one-liners the actors never oversell instead using their bodies to convey the weight of responsibility (Mr. Russell��s sheriff) the vanity of the professional killer (Mr. Fox) and the bone weariness of a deputy who��s too old for this posse nonsense (Mr. Jenkins)." though Mr. Wilson bests them all as O��Dwyer a cowboy whose wife has been kidnapped by the deviants and whose broken leg threatens to stall the rescue mission. The kidnappers ��� helpfully described as inbred cave dwellers or ���troglodytes �� lest we think that Native Americans are being depicted as people eaters ��� lurk a three-day ride from the little town of Bright Hope where the abductions occurred. For some this interlude will be a richly rewarding highlight as veteran performers gnaw on their roles and Benji Bakshi��s arid photography adds gravity and grandeur; for others it will be a longueur to be endured before the splatter commences." Mr. Zahler doesn��t disappoint with scenes that are swift sure and shockingly brutal. Right to the end the movie��s idiosyncratic sensibility doesn��t flag with villains who sew animal bones into their throats to facilitate their bloodcurdling battle cries and a victim who meets his end in the manner of a wishbone at Thanksgiving dinner. Even the song that plays over the end credits ��� a frontier-ditty parody by Mr. Zahler and Jeff Herriott ��� is worth staying seated for. Grisly and offbeat ���Bone Tomahawk�� may boast abysmal racial politics but they��re also true to the terrors of the time.

one that ends on a bittersweet equivocal note. It takes place in 1912 at an important moment in the British suffragist movement and very much in the middle of the long journey toward equality. Agitation for the vote had been going on for decades and the franchise would not be extended fully to women until 1928. In ���Suffragette �� demonstrators fill the streets of London and militants carry out acts of vandalism smashing windows and blowing up mailboxes. The chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George holds hearings on a parliamentary amendment. The cause of voting rights is embodied by Emmeline Pankhurst who is seen in newspaper photographs and briefly seen in the person of Meryl Streep." with a Special Branch detective (Brendan Gleeson) chasing after the militants as they plot their actions. It also has a strain of melodrama as Maud is forced to make terrible sacrifices for the cause. What joins these narrative strands is the feminist insight that the subjugation of women extends from the highest reaches of government through the workplace and into the domestic sphere. They have no voice in Parliament on the factory floor or at home and while nobody ��� least of all Maud ��� supposes that the vote will solve everything it will at least be a start." �� directed by Sarah Gavron from a screenplay by Abi Morgan could easily have fallen into this kind of trap. The specific battle it chronicles ��� for the right of women to vote ��� was won in Britain and the United States a long time ago. Britain elected its first female prime minister in 1979; we might have a woman president before too long. A more conventional film about the fight for suffrage could easily have riled us up with a portrait of bygone oppression and then congratulated us on the progress we��ve made. But this one has an argument to make or rather a series of arguments about the workings of patriarchal power the complexities of political resistance and the economic implications of the right to vote. You might come for the feminism stay for the class consciousness and arrive at the conclusion that they��re not so distinct after all." �� and the script has a few too many glowingly emotive speeches. The final turns of the tale are suspenseful but also a bit frantic. But it is also stirring and cleareyed ��� the best kind of history lesson." though Maud��s supervisor (Geoff Bell) is a fine portrait of male depravity. But ���Suffragette�� also avoids the all-too-common tactics of placing a sympathetic member of the oppressor class at the center of the drama or making it all about the awakening of a man��s conscience. Instead it shows the limits of solidarity even when the sympathetic ties of family or class are involved. It also underlines the viciousness with which power reacts when it is challenged." on an ordinary woman whose life is changed by political engagement. Her name is Maud Watts and she��s played by Carey Mulligan with somber determination and inspiring pluck. Maud works in an industrial laundry alongside her husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw) and scores of women for whom dangerous labor low pay and sexual harassment are matters of daily routine. Maud accepts her lot finding happiness with Sonny and their young son George. She is caught up in suffragist activities almost by accident out of curiosity and loyalty to a co-worker (Anne-Marie Duff). Before long she is attending clandestine meetings in the back room of a pharmacy run by Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter)." domestic and public.

Like many filmmakers she offers you a kind of interpretive key to the movie in its opening moments starting with close-ups that move across an artwork washed in sepia and embellished with dark squiggles and words.

Milgram turns out to be somewhat of a downer understandably so given his interests and the later harsh career-damaging criticisms of his most famous work.

This hourlong feature the filmmaker��s debut depicts dozens of faces and bodies black white and brown most of them gathered at the intersection of 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in East Harlem during the summer of 2014. None of these faces and bodies belong to actors but it won��t do to call this powerful film a documentary." his film is so beautifully constructed that nothing in it ever seems obvious. In his poetic way and his eventual approach to the metaphysical he makes his case. While the movie��s multiple images are never less than numinous and its rhythms sometimes skirt the strangely seductive this astonishing movie is the opposite of hypnotic." there is an evident affinity with the Portuguese director Pedro Costa who structured a trilogy of dramas around the lives of residents in Fontainhas a poor section of Lisbon. In Mr. Allah��s film one image of a young African-American woman front-lit with what could be taken as an almost heavenly radiance calls to mind Mr. Costa��s strategy of mining beauty from subjects and objects merely by depicting them with pinpoint clarity. Mr. Allah toys with focus quite a bit throughout his parade of close-ups but when he comes in sharp the details of skin textures the whites and pupils of the eyes and more are always startling. But unlike Mr. Costa��s films Mr. Allah��s cinema is on the fast side; this hourlong movie is a kind of montage with some shots lasting only a second or two; the longest rarely go beyond 30 or 40."

Crucially he doesn��t live in a room or the room but in Room which he refers to as if it were another living being. (In the novel Ms. Donoghue capitalizes Jack��s significant nouns.) This anthropomorphizing is a charming humanizing quirk. Heard again and again onscreen though it might have also registered as overly calculated if Mr. Tremblay��s electrically alive performance carried a trace of artifice. But his presence in the movie has a crystalline purity and while Jack makes life bearable for Ma Mr. Tremblay makes the movie bearable for you. His essential child being his fragility and buoyancy his shrieks of happiness and complaint air the room out." largely because of Jack it devolves into a dreary platitudinous therapy movie in its second largely because of Ma. This part of the story which takes place outside their prison is filled with violently disgorged emotions that give Ms. Larson plenty to do and ornamented with a handful of bustling guest stars ��� a crisp Joan Allen a poorly served William H.

Ms. Donoghue also wrote the movie which commences with Jack opening his eyes and lifts off with his fifth birthday a milestone that has profoundly different significance for him and for Ma. As that day dawns you may not initially grasp just how cramped their living quarters are. The director Lenny Abrahamson and his crew have created a space that opens and close like an accordion one that expands into a virtual suite depending on the camera angles and lenses the editing and especially the close-ups that obscure its dimensions until a jolting wide shot cuts it back down to size." Jack��s vision and Mr. Tremblay��s presence create a curious paradox because they help make ���Room�� an oddly comfortable viewing experience especially in its first hour. Mr. Abrahamson by following the book��s lead and embracing Jack��s point of view so strongly specifically in his Expressionistic translation of the novelistic first-person to the screen has managed the difficult task of externalizing the inner life of another person. In the process however he leaves Ma behind. Ms. Larson her bright face dimmed and eyes ringed works hard to bring Ma to persuasive life digging into grief in her corner of the room between hopeless smiles but Mr. Abrahamson��s lack of attention turns her into an overly muted supporting player." ���Room�� is about two people who have yet to cut the cord.

Mr. Letterman uses his movie as a toy chest of characters more than as a medium the muggy Mr. Black included.

Maybe the makers of the new feature film based on the books by R. L.

Zack (Dylan Minnette) is the one unlucky enough to discover Stine��s secret after befriending the writer��s daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush).

Seeing it for the first time on a big screen I was caught up in the chaos of combat and the feverish pace of the story.

That Mr. Elba can be scary and charismatic at the same time will not be news to anyone who saw him in ���The Wire �� but the Commandant lacks the ambition and the entrepreneurial savvy of Stringer Bell. He is to Agu and the others a larger-than-life figure half monster and half wizard.

(It��s also strange that the war-ravaged nation remains unnamed. Imagine a fiercely realistic film about genocidal violence in the 1940s set in a place identified only as ���Europe.��) Mr. Fukunaga compensates by offering a complex inquiry into the psychology of power and the emotional logic of total war. When the Commandant finds him Agu has lost his friends his family his home and any feeling of security he might have had. Militia life offers a ready-made set of substitutes. He befriends another very young fighter called Strika (Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye) who never speaks. Teenage soldiers like 2nd I-C (Kurt Egyiawan) become his surrogate older brothers." ���Beasts of No Nation�� is based on Uzodinma Iweala��s harrowing linguistically dazzling novel of a child soldier��s life. Mr. Iweala��s distinctive prose style is sometimes echoed in Agu��s voice-over narration but the boy��s point of view is more immediately conveyed in the watchful eyes and sensitive features of Abraham Attah the nimble young actor who plays him. Agu is numbed by horror and hardened by the brutality he has witnessed and perpetrated. The Commandant (Idris Elba) trains him and his comrades to be ���warriors �� which is to say war criminals. While the film like the book does not turn away from the atrocities they commit it also doesn��t allow you to forget that they��re children." who describes himself as ���a good boy from a good family �� seems perfectly harmless ��� a skinny preadolescent whose capacity for malice doesn��t extend beyond pranks directed at his vain girl-crazy older brother.

He��s talking about Agu a newly captured prisoner and also potentially a fresh recruit who has fled into the forest hoping to escape the violence that has consumed his hometown." but it also can feel a little familiar with ambushes late-night firefights and urban skirmishes drawn from a tried-and-true genre playbook.

He is referred to as ���the Unspeakable.��" a wonderful natural singer to audition for an ���American Idol��-like television show that he is sure Ody can win singing a Patty Pravo hit and to find and confront their biological father." especially the early ones exalt a similar spirit of heedless abandon and liberation from restraint a similar go-for-broke enthusiasm. That spirit is contagious. You come away from ���Xenia�� feeling a bit more alive and ready to throw caution to the wind." ���Xenia �� the director��s fourth feature may be unwieldy. It has an unnecessary romantic subplot involving Ody��s relationship with a Ukrainian girl. ���Xenia�� has been called a farce. But it is much more than that. Both the story and the performances are packed with raw emotion. Dany��s behavior may be outlandish and irritating but you applaud his courage." there is an undercurrent subtext of sexual attraction mostly on Dany��s part. Ody has a hairy chest a fetish of Dany��s and when Ody is undressed Dany surreptitiously gawks at him. In one scene they get drunk and wildly dance together. The movie knows just when to stop before their affectionate horseplay turns into incest." who is straight can lose patience with Dany��s defiant flamboyance which more than once lands him in serious danger. Dany invites verbal abuse because it allows him to unleash stinging verbal counterattacks that drive bullies into rages. To his brother��s horror Dany before leaving Crete found a gun which more than once he brandishes in a fit of hysteria. As much as you fear for Dany you admire the crazy recklessness of a boy who insists on being himself." the saucy 15-year-old boy who lights up Panos H. Koutras��s exuberant road movie ���Xenia �� is a flouncy gay provocateur. First seen being serviced by a much older man he wears his bleached blond hair swept over one eye has a pierced septum and is addicted to sweets. For much of the film he is shown sucking on a lollipop like a pouty 5-year-old. Dany keeps a pet rabbit named Dido and is obsessed with the Italian pop diva Patty Pravo."

They return to the club in a state of euphoria that morphs into panic when they learn from a television report of a critical oversight. As they run for their lives the roller coaster makes its final precipitous dip into chaos." driven by pounding electronica this German heist thriller directed by Sebastian Schipper conveys the queasy excitement of being dropped onto a roller coaster midride.

Since his death in 2011 the Jobs cult of personality has spawned among other products a prior biopic (starring Ashton Kutcher) a documentary (directed by the prolific Alex Gibney) and two prominent biographies. The first of these authorized by Jobs himself and written by Walter Isaacson is the credited source of Mr. Sorkin��s screenplay and the film though it takes the usual liberties with facts and characters basically upholds the book��s account ��� disputed by some members of Jobs��s family and by some executives at Apple ��� of Jobs��s temperament his foibles and his talent." the co-founder of Apple in the course of his rise has betrayed his friends alienated his allies and mistreated his loved ones challenges some deeply cherished myths about the correlation between virtue and success. Jobs��s behavior also confirms equally deep assumptions about the ultimate virtue of ruthlessness in the capitalist economy. He��s heroic and despicable. He inspires loyalty and resentment often from the same people. A cold rationalist who is certain he knows what the public wants Jobs remains a mystery to those who know him best and a brilliant steely-eyed enigma at the center of the new movie that bears his name." and beautifully by Makenzie Moss Ripley Sobo and Perla Haney-Jardine) he tries at first to deny his paternity altogether. Lisa��s mother Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) is portrayed as needy and unstable while Lisa herself is so to speak an apple that fell close to the paternal tree. She is not in the movie to humanize him ��� Jobs��s wife and other children are not in the movie at all ��� but rather to help us measure by means of a dramatically necessary shorthand just how complicated he is." secular equivalents of medieval lives of the saints; cautionary tales and beacons of aspiration. ���Steve Jobs�� is a rich and potent document of the times an expression of both the awe that attends sophisticated new consumer goods and the unease that trails in the wake of their arrival. The movie burnishes the image of this visionary C.E.O. even as it tries to peek behind the curtain at the gimcrack machinery of omnipotence. Mostly though it is a formally audacious intellectually energized entertainment a powerful challenge to the lazy conventions of Hollywood storytelling and a feast for connoisseurs of contemporary screen acting. Michael Fassbender is in it. Kate Winslet and Jeff Daniels too. Also Seth Rogen and Michael Stuhlbarg. They are all as you might expect really good. That should be enough." rather than a dramatic principal. Jobs��s foils are Wozniak (Mr. Rogen) ��� the Fozzie Bear to his Kermit ��� and John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) who came from Pepsi to Apple and serves as Jobs��s link to the corporate world. Woz is a beloved rivalrous sibling and Sculley a surrogate father but Jobs continually denies the psychological complexities of the relationships insisting that it��s all about business." �� David Fincher��s brooding fantasia about Mark Zuckerberg and the founding of Facebook Mr. Sorkin simplified the protagonist locating the supposed source of Zuckerberg��s inspiration in romantic frustration and status anxiety. ���Steve Jobs �� a less perfect movie is nonetheless a more credible character study and it leaves behind a fascinating residue of ambivalence." of consumers as well as co-workers was both empathetic and chillingly instrumental. ���Steve Jobs�� is a creation myth written by a skeptic. Whether or not we worship Steve Jobs the world most of us live in is the one he made." a marketing executive who describes herself at one point as Jobs��s ���work wife.�� A scant presence in Mr. Isaacson��s book Hoffman is the film��s most obviously Sorkinesque figure a cousin to Allison Janney��s C.

Her ambition is tethered to his her intelligence the polished mirror of his incandescent brilliance." �� the thing that makes it work as both tribute and critique is how messy it is. It sprawls it sags it grinds its gears and at times almost crashes from frantic multitasking. And yet the result is not chaos but coherence. Rejecting both linear chronology and the frame-and-flashback template of most movie biographies Mr. Sorkin concentrates on three crucial moments in Jobs��s career. Though there are a few glances into the past most of the action unfolds in the anxious minutes leading up to a product launch. The products are not the newest the most successful or the best known. And the man presenting them is sometimes a clean-shaven yuppie in a bow tie and a double-breasted blazer rather than the bestubbled mock-turtlenecked guru we think we remember." put to Steve Jobs by his erstwhile partner Steve Wozniak in the middle of a heated argument are both practical and rhetorical. Jobs is not a designer an engineer or a coder ��� he relies on other people to do all of that among them his ���little buddy�� Woz ��� but he has somehow risen to the top of the computer business. That doesn��t quite seem fair." almost absurd suspense. (Daniel Pemberton��s score contributes a lot to this feeling). You hold your breath waiting to see what��s going to happen even though you know exactly what is in store. A guy is going to come out onstage and show you a new gadget. Maybe one you bought when you were younger and got rid of a long time ago." a proponent of closed systems streamlined construction and conceptual simplicity. Mr. Boyle and Mr. Sorkin in contrast are fervent maximalists prone respectively to busy breakneck visual effects and roiling torrents of verbiage. The collision of their styles is fascinating and sometimes disorienting to watch. The usual Sorkinian rhythms ��� walk and talk; stand and shout; quip and parry ��� are sped up and syncopated by Mr. Boyle��s tireless kineticism."

And though we might wish for more depth and detail especially from the women in Mr. Smith��s orbit the directors ��� who have collaborated successfully before most notably on the 2010 documentary ���Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work�� ��� recognize that a more universal tale is taking shape.

Accordingly she interweaves her candid straight-to-camera musings and medical updates with scenes of her directing actors in a fictional film based on events as they unfold." starring a perfect Lili Taylor as a more lighthearted version of Ms. Sichel (who died in 2014) injects a welcome airiness that counteracts the increasingly discouraging test results that punctuate the narrative. Humor also leavens the melancholy ��� the aforementioned death scene being a comic highlight ��� as do the warmth and pragmatism of Ms. Sichel��s extended family." uncertain tone engendered by Ms. Sichel��s striving to align her Buddhist beliefs with the harsh realities of terminal illness also weakens her story��s gravitational pull. So does the sidelining of her husband Erich Hahn whose frustrations poke through in jagged snippets that we wish were more fully explored. When in a dinner scene he tries to set a place for the camera operator and his irritated wife removes it his questioning of whether she recognizes the line between documenting reality and creating her own version of it is the movie��s most resonant moment."

justice fights an awkward battle against corruption incompetence and viral gossip in the Hindi movie ���Talvar.�� Directed by Meghna Gulzar from a script by Vishal Bhardwaj the film is based on a true-life murder case involving the deaths of a middle-class 14-year-old girl and an older male servant. Ms. Gulzar investigates the crime��s multiple investigations and using a docudrama style shows different versions of the killings." their behavior escalating from obnoxious to bullying to irrevocably violent. (Here and throughout Pankaj Kumar��s excellent cinematography with its bleached-out palette lends a sickly pallor to the quotidian.)" the first responders provide some base-level incompetence: They fail to notice evidence or contaminate it and pursue sensationalist theories that the news media massed outside the crime scene take up and amplify: The girl was having an affair with the servant!

The log keeps the words flowing in what could have been a fairly quiet movie creating an animated lively babble that approaches the chummy feel of a video face chat. Watney makes for affably pleasant if worrisome company and if there isn��t much mystery to him it��s because the purity of his struggle doesn��t leave him at least time for deep dives into questions of existence." ���The Martian�� stars Matt Damon as an American astronaut who like a latter-day Robinson Crusoe learns to survive on his own island of despair. At once epic and intimate it involves a dual journey into outer and inner space a trip that takes you into that immensity called the universe and deep into the equally vast landscape of a single consciousness. For this accidental castaway space is the place where he��s physically marooned but also where his mind is set free ��� a dynamic that of course invokes moviegoing itself." with no means of communicating with Earth the parallel narrative means that he��s never truly alone unlike say Crusoe (before Friday) or Tom Hanks��s character in ���Cast Away�� (before Wilson) whose profound isolation is critical to how you experience them and their stories. Like these other marooned souls (including the 1964 ���Robinson Crusoe on Mars��) Watney is physically and psychologically apart but even before he pings Earth with his big news you know people are mourning him. The Earth scenes interrupt these solitary interludes with other faces and voices keeping the narrative jumping but they also assert that no matter how lost and seemingly forgotten no one is alone because to be human fundamentally is to exist with other people. We are social therefore we are." the two stories become one as Watney and everyone else gets to work. At NASA various brainiacs take hammers and tongs to physics at both the Johnson Space Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where supernerds take on the logistics of a rescue mission. The movie gently thumps several issues: It��s unambiguously on the side of science and rationalism with glints of manifest destiny American can-do-ism and a little flag-waving folded in. It is also about willing yourself out of the lonely room ��� call it Mars or your head ��� and into the world however inhospitable so you can breathe the air and drink the water (Watney learns to make both) and yearn for others. It��s a moving testament from the 77-year-old Mr. Scott whose art comes in all shades of dark." loosest and most optimistic of the group at once an ode to far-out adventuring and to terra-firma home a sweeping old-fashioned entertainment and a plaintive portrait of solitude as both a creative necessity and a danger. It also serves as a nice plug for NASA which has returned the favor by pushing the movie on its website. (On Monday scientists announced that signs of liquid water could be seen in photographs taken on Mars by a camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter timing that suggests NASA certainly has the whole cross-promotion thing down.)" by contrast he seems almost giddily attuned to the buzz of human endeavor. The NASA scenes with their friendly familiar faces ��� Chiwetel Ejiofor Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels ��� unfold with charming predictability with corrugated brows hushed and raised voices acres of glowing screens and warehouses of space stuff. The vibe is of serious smart people doing serious smart work for the good of the rest of us. Mr. Ejiofor��s enormous pleading eyes signal how grave the situation is while Ms. Wiig��s prickly warmth and Mr. Daniels��s Daffy Duck mouth-flapping keep the whole thing from getting too heavy. Mr. Scott is a brilliant assembler of casts and he knows how to organize groups so they seem to naturally fit and can bob and weave in unison with his roving cameras." streamlined script the movie focuses on Mark Watney (Mr. Damon) who during a windstorm on Mars is accidentally left behind by his team. Mr. Scott likes the action to hit hard and fast: One minute Watney is joking with his space buddies ��� Jessica Chastain leads a crew that includes Kate Mara and Michael Pe�a ��� and minutes later he��s been hooked like a fish by some flying metal that knocks him out. Believing him dead the crew takes off as does the movie which soon becomes a tale of two planets with initially competing narratives one involving Watney��s efforts simply to stay alive and the second centered on NASA��s postdisaster strategizing." he has always been a good director of actors though it��s instructive that he uses performers who are either forceful enough screen presences or strikingly beautiful enough (usually both) to stand up to his lush visual style who can meet the challenge of his meaningfully complex sets and natural vistas. When the film works the bold drama of his visuals and the dramatic boldness of his stories flow together becoming all of a narrative piece. Some of these pieces resonate with other meanings like the red-rock buttes in ���Thelma & Louise�� and the similarly rust-colored formations in ���The Martian�� that are suggestive of John Ford��s Monument Valley films. Sometimes here Mr. Scott seems to be returning to his own work which may be why you can see Susan Sarandon (Louise) with her protuberant gaze and thin-skinned tremulousness in Mr. Ejiofor. And of course Mr. Scott loves tough women so it��s no surprise that Ms. Chastain and Ms. Mara are on board." turning them into bloated vehicles for directorial self-aggrandizement. Mr. Damon��s Everyman quality (he��s our Jimmy Stewart) helps scale the story down but what makes this epic personal is Mr. Scott��s filmmaking in which every soaring aerial shot of the red planet is answered by the intimate landscape of a face. There��s a touch of Cecil B. DeMille in his cinematic DNA (for better and occasionally for worse) though like many who saw ���2001: A Space Odyssey�� during their esthetically formative years there��s even more Stanley Kubrick. But Mr. Scott is very much his own artist one whose reputation as a visual stylist has at times obscured that his great persistent theme is what it means to be human." death and science."

Though it is gentle and meditative rather than confrontational the film nonetheless bristles with topical concerns.

Like Mr. Panahi��s cab his film is equipped with both windows and mirrors. It��s reflective and revealing intimate and wide-ranging compact and moving." his bleeding head cradled in the lap of his anguished wife asks Mr. Panahi to make a cellphone video of his last testament.

The film is primarily interested in spreading her message and seems pitched to a young audience. Nothing wrong with that. But it only occasionally delivers the kind of unguarded moment that makes you feel as if you��re getting beneath the media image and it is not at all interested in discussing broader issues raised by Ms. Yousafzai��s fame." the Pakistani teenager who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 but has continued to speak out on behalf of education for girls is a familiar face in the West by now thanks to a best-selling book television appearances speaking engagements and of course the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize (which she shared with Kailash Satyarthi). But you may wonder about the real person behind the media phenomenon." the film doesn��t particularly examine the price of Western superstardom. Ms. Yousafzai now 18 doesn��t say much about demands and intrusions on her personal life that must rival those experienced by young rock stars. And just how her fame is affecting things back home in the Swat Valley of Pakistan if at all remains unexplored as does the uneasy question of how much heritage you have to give up to become a Western media darling." who steal the show every time they��re on camera. They seem largely indifferent to her fame and make wiseacre remarks about her just the way any brothers would.

when the prevailing attitude toward the Nazi past was a state of willful amnesia. Ordinary Germans who had joined the Nazi Party and committed atrocities returned to civilian life. A statute of limitations prevented prosecutions for war crimes excepting murder." ���Labyrinth of Lies�� has the dogged tone of an honorable well-made television movie from the late 1950s or early ��60s. Its most admirable trait is a refusal to sensationalize its subject. There are no flashbacks to grisly acts of torture and killing no scenes of skeletal inmates huddled behind barbed wire." a gifted young dressmaker. This is freighted with symbolism; Marlene��s business flourishes when the wives of former Nazis become her principal clientele." like Radmann knew little if anything about Auschwitz even though many older family members belonged to the Nazi Party and some even worked at the camp. Those confronted with committing atrocities in the past smugly trot out the familiar defense that they had no choice and were just following orders." Radmann finds his worst fears substantiated. He is encouraged in his investigations by Fritz Bauer a real-life prosecutor wonderfully played by Gert Voss who died in 2014 and to whom the film is dedicated. Bauer wears an expression of wide-eyed infinitely sad knowledge of evil." disquieting study of a society in a state of denial until the truth is bared." evidence of what might be called a national conspiracy of silence accumulates. There comes a point when he is sidetracked by his obsession with capturing the notorious Nazi doctor Josef Mengele  and bringing him to justice. In one of the creepiest scenes Radmann learns that Mengele who fled to South America has secretly returned to Germany under a pseudonym for the funeral of a family member in G�_nzburg. The prosecutor crashes a family banquet; Mengele as we now know was never apprehended and the film portrays the guests at that dinner as tacit conspirators in helping him evade capture." �� the much-decorated 1961 Stanley Kramer film about the Nuremberg trials of the 1940s in which top-ranking Nazis were tried for crimes against humanity. The trials are still imprinted in many people��s minds as the ultimate moment of reckoning after which a horrific chapter of history was more or less closed and the world moved on. Of course it wasn��t as simple as that." witnesses are shown testifying but their verbal accounts of what they endured are excerpted and made into a montage their words camouflaged by Niki Reiser and Sebastian Pille��s soundtrack which although mournful is never mawkish. There are no emotional meltdowns no grandiose speeches." �� which opens in 1958 resurrects a later chapter in the aftermath of the Holocaust that has largely faded from view at least for many Americans: the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials of the 1960s in which 22 former mid- and lower-level functionaries at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp were tried for murder." Johann Radmann (Alexander Fehling) a fictitious composite of three lawyers is an idealistic new employee in the public prosecutor��s office in Frankfurt frustrated by his banal work in a traffic court. Through Thomas Gnielka (Andr� Szymanski) a journalistic acquaintance he learns of Simon Kirsch (Johannes Krisch) an Auschwitz survivor who has accidentally crossed paths with one of his wartime persecutors who is now a schoolteacher. Radmann has never heard of Auschwitz which the screenplay (by Mr. Ricciarelli and Elisabeth Bartel) pointedly reminds us was not in Germany but in Poland." Radmann faces stern resistance.

arrogant interlopers on a cherished skyline. His coup recounted in his book ���To Reach the Clouds�� and in James Marsh��s excellent documentary ���Man on Wire �� is a cherished and bittersweet part of local history and Mr. Zemeckis astonishingly brings it back into the present tense. Even though the outcome is never in doubt ��� this may be the most spoiler-proof movie ever made ��� you can��t help holding your breath and clutching the armrests when Philippe steps out into the sky. The reality of the moment is so vivid that you may reflexively recoil as if you risked plunging onto the sidewalk below. And the moment lasts. I had forgotten just how long Mr. Petit stayed up there stretching a daredevil act into an astonishing and durable work of art." �� an anonymous New Yorker remarks marveling at the spectacle unfolding more than a hundred stories above street level. It��s the morning of Aug. 7 1974 and Philippe Petit is walking across a steel cable strung between the towers of the World Trade Center. Amid the gasps and murmurs that line stands out and invites a bit of pondering. It��s an expression of wonder for sure but it also carries an implication of jadedness especially for moviegoers. All the surround-sound bells and whistles and digitally enhanced fireworks in the world can��t quite shake us out of the feeling that we��ve seen it all before." the coup plotters head to New York where they acquire a few more accomplices (including James Badge Dale Ben Schwartz and the scene-stealing Steve Valentine) and begin their infiltration of the as-yet-unfinished Trade Center. Almost magically ���The Walk�� transforms itself into a beguiling caper movie full of comic energy and nimble ingenuity. Whereas the earlier sections suffered from an absence of dramatic conflict ��� Philippe is immune to doubt averse to introspection and impossible to argue with ��� the Manhattan chapters hum with practical tactical excitement. There are so many problems to solve: security guards to evade equipment to test disguises to wear." with darker implications falling across the story like early morning shadows on a sunny day. There are tensions among Philippe and his comrades including Annie. There is the danger of the coup itself. And of course for the audience there is the inevitable premonition of grief. But Mr. Zemeckis who wrote the script with Christopher Browne spares us heavy-handed portents of destruction. Instead he acknowledges the loss of the towers by lovingly and meticulously resurrecting them at the moment of their birth. The film becomes a poem of metal and concrete a symphony composed in glass and rebar light and air and brought alive by an antic crazy inspiration." in addition to being an aspiring wire walker is a juggler a mime and a unicyclist. He is as I��ve mentioned played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. This makes him objectively speaking the most annoying person on earth. And ���The Walk �� before ascending into the New York sky tries to seduce you with forced amazement and sleeve-tugging displays of whimsy. Instead of wowing you the movie gets in your face and yells ���Wow!�� It��s not quite the same feeling." Mr. Zemeckis has also matched it. He has used all his brazenness and skill to make something that once it leaves the ground defies not only gravity but time as well." �� Robert Zemeckis��s painstaking and dazzling cinematic re-creation of Mr. Petit��s feat stands in passionate opposition to that kind of thinking. There will always be fresh unimagined wonders in store. And fresh horrors too as the sight of the twin towers can��t help reminding us." as you may have read on a poster somewhere can take awhile. ���The Walk�� does not hit its stride right away. I might go a little further: The first half of the movie treads the boundary between mildly irritating and completely unbearable. Mr. Petit an elfin Frenchman with a terrible haircut is played by the manic-pixie song-and-dance man Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an irrepressible imp greeting the audience in accented English from a perch on the Statue of Liberty��s torch. The Manhattan skyline ��� digitally rendered to include the towers and to omit more recent construction ��� stretches out in the background and the lady in the harbor stoically tolerates the presence of her voluble compatriot." as is the mildly diverting tale of the period in Philippe��s life leading up to what he calls ���the coup.�� Glimpsing a pretty busker on a Paris street (she��s singing a Leonard Cohen song in French) he steals her audience and then bien s��r her heart. Her name is Annie she��s played by Charlotte Le Bon and she becomes the first of Philippe��s accomplices. Joining them are a photographer named Jean-Louis (Cl�ment Sibony) and a math whiz named Jean-Fran�_ois (C�sar Domboy) who is afraid of heights. Philippe��s mentor is an irascible Czech funambulist played as an irascible Czech funambulist in a movie of this kind must be played by Ben Kingsley." disregard for authority and neglect of personal safety. Your kids will love it." as its stubborn persistence. ���Forrest Gump �� ���Cast Away�� and the ���Back to the Future�� movies are stories of optimists battling the cruelty of history and the indifference of the universe. They are also each in its own way testaments to the ingenuity of their maker. Though he may see himself as more of a tinkerer than a visionary Mr. Zemeckis frequently uses the novelty of special effects in the service of an aesthetic idea that is also a moral ideal. Like Mr. Petit he��s interested in tackling the impossible which is to say in discovering new possibilities for delight and awe and celebrating the transformative power of human creativity."

The sampling of the magazine��s most famous work includes its cover of a revolver pointed at a dog��s head with the words ���If you don��t buy this magazine we��ll kill this dog.�� Another infamous moment was a fake ad ���If Ted Kennedy drove a Volkswagen he��d be president today �� which alluded to a deadly car accident involving Kennedy and prompted a lawsuit by the carmaker." The National Lampoon was founded in 1969 and first published in 1970 and it quickly established itself as a kind of Mad magazine with a post-countercultural readership for whom nothing was sacred and everything ripe for satire.

At the stroke of a pen their world has come undone and Mr. Bahrani captures the scene of his dispossession with almost unbearable precision plunging the viewer into a storm of agonized feeling as Dennis struggles with rage grief and shame at having been pulled in front of his neighbors into the ranks of society��s losers." �� an overplotted overacted movie with Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron as a father and son trying to save their family farm. With ���99 Homes �� which he wrote with Amir Naderi Mr. Bahrani has recovered his balance and sharpened his already formidable knack for concise emotionally potent storytelling. True to its neorealist pedigree the film works partly as a fable an illustration of how impersonal forces shape individual human destinies. Its palette of feeling includes a bright streak of anger at the way banks judges and politicians conspire to bully and bamboozle hard-working people like Dennis and also at the way the pursuit of wealth has eclipsed all other sources of value in our lives." who was an annoyingly needy Spider-Man is entirely credible as a man risking his decency to protect himself and his loved ones. When Dennis starts carrying out evictions for Rick his natural empathy proves to be an asset. He can give predatory capitalism a friendly human face. Mr. Shannon though is the film��s center of gravity ��� its supernova its black hole its avatar of cosmic disorder. Like Michael Douglas in ���Wall Street�� or Alec Baldwin in ���Glengarry Glen Ross �� he is the seductive embodiment of capitalist amorality a handsome devil offering a small amount of cash for your house keys and slightly better terms for your immortal soul." �� Ramin Bahrani��s stunningly effective melodrama of flipped houses and mortgaged souls. While the film hardly endorses Rick��s coldblooded dog-eat-dog view of the world it is too cleareyed to oppose his ruthlessness with soft easy appeals to sentiment. The foreclosed properties Rick acquires and resells may be repositories of hopes dreams and family memories but they��re also economic units ���boxes�� to be emptied out refilled and written down on a balance sheet. That��s a fact of life and also a tragic contradiction." you may start to become aware of the traps ���99 Homes�� has set for itself and to anticipate endings that seem too bleak too soothing or too sensational to fulfill the film��s promise. But the ending if I may say so without giving anything away is just right absolutely consistent with Mr. Bahrani��s acute impassioned understanding of contemporary American reality. The final shot is at once perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous a reminder that some contradictions are more easily understood than resolved." Rick (played with tiger-shark ferocity by Michael Shannon) could conduct a self-help seminar on how to think act and dress like a winner. With an e-cigarette clenched between his teeth a pistol strapped to his ankle and a cellphone glued to his ear Rick may be heartless but he certainly isn��t dumb. His assessment of the brutalities of the housing market in Central Florida ��� and of the Darwinian logic that underlies them ��� is hard to dispute. The bubble has burst and as homeowners like Dennis find themselves underwater trapped in treacherous and complicated loans Rick is on hand to clean up the mess or at least to profit from it. Compassion is for suckers and one man��s misery is another��s opportunity." �� ���Chop Shop�� and ���Goodbye Solo�� ��� were exemplary works of American neo-neorealism using mostly nonprofessional casts and a stripped-down shooting style to tell stories of economic striving and spiritual struggle. Like the original Italian neorealists (and like the Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne their most prominent present-day heirs) Mr. Bahrani is especially interested in how the material circumstances of his characters affect their moral decisions. The need for money and for the security dignity and status it brings can force terrible choices on people but hard times and systemic injustice don��t absolve anyone of ethical responsibility." it is also a minor masterpiece of suspense as tightly wound as ���Sicario �� Denis Villeneuve��s white-knuckle drug-war thriller and almost as brutal. Not that there��s much in the way of physical violence: fists are raised now and then and weapons are sometimes brandished. But the threat of destruction is pervasive and everything ��� the hand-held camerawork the swift editing the anxious music by Antony Partos and Matteo Zingales ��� contributes to an overpowering sense of danger." backed up by sheriff��s deputies and bank documents to tell families that they are now trespassing on property they thought was theirs. The furniture goes out on the sidewalk and the residents enter a spiral of downward mobility. Some plead for more time others wave papers and invoke lawyers and a few threaten violence but the result is always the same. Dennis Connor and Lynn wind up sharing a room in a motel overflowing with families in similar circumstances. Maybe the game is rigged or maybe the laws of nature just work that way. It hardly matters to Rick ��� or to Dennis whose passage from Rick��s victim to his prot�g� forms the main axis of the film��s narrative."

Structurally the messy table is a means for Ben the ultimate can-do type whom Jules doesn��t want to engage to at last catch her attention. And he does just that when he clears it inaugurating a work relationship that soon turns into a friendship." she makes the kind of lifestyle fantasies you sink into like eiderdown. Her movies are frothy playful homogeneous routinely maddening and generally pretty irresistible even when they��re not all that good. Her most notable visual signature is the immaculate luxuriously appointed interiors she��s known to fuss over personally ��� they inevitably feature throw pillows that look as if they��ve been arranged with a measuring tape. These interiors are fetishized by moviegoers and Architectural Digest alike ready-made for Pinterest and comment threads peppered with questions like ���Where do I get that hat?��" who��s regularly forced to take Jules��s inner girl out for a sniffle and a sob does her best but it��s hopeless. Jules is less of a character and more of a fast-walking speed-talking collection of gender grievances some of which originate with a squirmy house husband Matt (Anders Holm). One look at that guy��s smile and you want Mr. De Niro to wipe it off. He doesn��t but there��s no need to because Mr. De Niro owns the movie from the moment he opens his mouth and is staring into the camera and right at you. (Oh yes he��s lookin�� at you.) You can��t look away and soon you don��t want to. Certainly Ms. Meyers doesn��t want anyone to because though she loves the idea of the successful independent woman she also ardently wants to make room for daddy." lazy screenwriting contrivance and it says more about Ms. Meyers��s conflicted ideas about powerful women than it conveys anything interesting about Jules. A successful Hollywood director like Ms. Meyers for starters would never have gotten this far and with a number of hits to her name if she had been afraid of telling other people what to do. But Ms. Meyers has some distinct ideas about women work and power and so she piles on the issues: Jules is chronically late to meetings among other sins although that seems to be because she likes riding slowly through the office on her bicycle. The bike suggests that she��s a nonconformist although the neat rows of her pretty young overwhelmingly white employees doing something in front of their computers suggest otherwise." Robert De Niro plays Ben Whittaker a 70-year-old widower who shakes up his life when he becomes an intern at a web start-up where he soon becomes an office mascot and geezer Tinker Bell. Mostly though Ben is the benign face of patriarchy a gentler kinder father figure who comes equipped with a laundered handkerchief and the wisdom of the elders. He shares both with his new boss Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway) the founder of an online clothing site that has rocketed from zero to zillions in record time. She runs her company with a steely grip and a forced smile in a refurbished Brooklyn warehouse the size of Grand Central Terminal. She��s a success and possibly an obsessive-compulsive (she all but showers in hand sanitizer) but she��s also floundering one crisis at a time." �� but he proves more than up to the task. Ms. Meyers��s script makes sure that��s the case as does the smartest choice she makes in ���The Intern��: Mr. De Niro her loosest most valuable player. Long celebrated for his vein-popping intensity Mr. De Niro has been yukking it up in comedy since the 1960s. Part of what distinguishes his later laugh-ins is that they��re inextricably haunted by the ghost of Travis Bickle and sometimes ��� as when Mr. De Niro breaks out his terrifying ear-to-ear Soupy Sales grin ��� Rupert Pupkin his nut job from ���The King of Comedy.�� However straight his character he can��t help but be a destabilizing force which is crucial when a movie is as hermetically sealed as ���The Intern.��" who with quiet confidence paternal competence and a driver��s license helps Jules get on track at work and home in the way that none of the man-children in her life can. Ms. Meyers has clearly been binging on Judd Apatow comedies and she stacks her movie with assorted bromantic schlumps (including a troika that functions like a farm team version of Seth Rogen Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) whose sloppy clothes and facial hair emblematize not only their arrested development but also a crisis in masculinity. That guys like these help run the world (and the entertainment business) without hauling around a leather briefcase is immaterial to Ms. Meyers presumably because it would get in the way of her new take on the rescue narrative."

It��s not for nothing that the first scene in ���Misunderstood�� takes place at the dinner table that familiar stage for dramatics.

This may be because she once shared the name of the 9-year-old girl Aria who observes this turbulent world as if it were a drama she might one day stage." �� a film that despite its allusions to her own life she has characterized as personal rather than autobiographical. An actress turned director (���Scarlet Diva��) she is the daughter of Dario Argento the Italian cult filmmaker and Daria Nicolodi an actress and screenwriter. Ms. Argento wrote ���Misunderstood�� with Barbara Alberti and they have come up with a story that wavers between realism and surrealism and sometimes feels like a faraway dream and at times a nightmare. One reason for this instability is that the film ��� from its initial images of a small hand writing in a book ornamented with scrawls and hearts ��� has been filtered through Aria an intensely sympathetic presence who may also be somewhat of an unreliable narrator." pluckily forlornly ��� between the competing needs of the monstrous narcissists she calls Mother and Father. At once cartoonish and all too viscerally real Father (Gabriel Garko) is a dandyish actor with blond hair big white teeth and ravenous ambitions. On the brink of a career breakthrough he shows little interest in anyone other than himself with the exception of his daughter Lucrezia (Carolina Poccioni) from an earlier relationship. For her part Aria��s mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg excellent) a pianist and sadist has eyes only for Donatina (Anna Lou Castoldi) yet another daughter from another coupling. This leaves Aria the only product of HER mother and father��s unhappy union very much the odd girl out." probably because she��s seen it before. She��s an astonishingly resilient child at least until she isn��t and she escapes partly through her imagination (that��s her scribbling in the opening credits) and partly through her friendships with another schoolgirl and especially the cat she calls Dac. Ms. Argento makes the most of her young star��s blue eyes which only seem to grow larger after Aria cuts her hair and uses the girl��s small stature to occasionally devastating effect.

We all wear them as protection; modern life forces us to.�� Ms. Chang and Mr. To play with some of the same ideas in ���Office �� which focuses on a group whose masks are rapidly slipping off loosened by modern life and love as well as the collision between private lives and public lies. Ho and Chang��s affair is one lie but there are other untruths including that of capitalism��s equally rising boats which is why when Lee sings ���I want everyone to see me doing great �� there��s a stooped man in the background pushing a load of trash." ���Office�� registers as up to the minute because of China��s economic turmoil. Its smashing look gives visible form to the idea of China as an enormous machine even as Mr. To nods to other reference points from the pinwheeling Busby Berkeley-like formations to the huge office clock that seems transported from ���Metropolis �� to Lee��s popping eyes and swooping bangs which invoke Robert Morse in the 1967 movie musical ���How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.�� The songs in ���Office�� aren��t especially memorable. But it��s hard to care too much when you have a director who knows how to create tension by moving the camera and characters even while he��s delivering a nimble political softshoe with filmmaking dazzle." ���Office�� takes place largely in a Chinese company the amusingly named Jones & Sunn that jumps to the rhythms of the stock market its vertiginous ups and downs its soaring promises and crushing defeats. The company is on the verge of going public and with billions in the balance there are complications among them the hush-hush affair that the married chairman Mr. Ho (Chow Yun Fat) has been having with the single-gal chief executive officer Ms. Chang (Sylvia Chang). After years of tag-team Machiavellianism Ho and Chang have drifted apart their bonds frayed by the corporate and family intrigues that ��� with a lot of singing and a little dancing ��� put a human face on China��s authoritarian capitalism." a striver with eyes the size of hubcaps who starts working as an intern at Jones & Sunn the same day as another newbie Kat (Lang Yueting). A willowy wisp with a peekaboo curtain of hair Kat catches Lee��s attention when she��s ushered alone into an express elevator while the rest of the building��s workers serenely line up to ride steerage. Dressed in their regulation business uniforms (shades of blue black gray and white) these other men and women wait in aligned rows that echo the set��s floor-to-ceiling patterning turning them into points on an all-encompassing grid. Only Lee��s exuberance and a few close-ups of strappy polka-dotted shoes suggest the yelp of the individual amid the herd." where a pleasurably different entertainment has been slipped in among the familiar offerings. ���Office�� is the latest from the Hong Kong auteur Johnnie To who at 60 has directed more than 50 features. If you��ve heard of him it may be because of thrillers like ���PTU�� and ���Triad Election �� in which his peerless technique eye for beauty and grasp of darkness flow as fluidly as his prowling cameras. If Mr. To were an American his name would fall from lips as easily as Martin Scorsese��s another artist alive to cinema��s past as well as its present." �� which opens on a man tending a comatose woman in a hospital bed you know that you��ve entered a place a little to the left of the usual realism. The hospital like most of the locations the homes the after-hour joints and the office is made of see-through geometric forms instead of solid walls. It��s a world of grid patterns and transparency one that looks as if it had been made out of framing materials like a house under construction or one that��s soon to be razed. For a brief moment the design evokes the empty stage in ���Our Town�� and the deconstructed sets in Lars von Trier experiments like ���Dogville.�� But then a multitude of computer-generated people begins trooping through the credits suggesting a new kind of army on the march."

���Songs From the North�� is mostly nonnarrative drawing on North Korean film and TV clips to sketch a sensibility that ��� however stoked by propaganda ��� prizes family above all and melds that with a zealous commitment to the fatherland. Song and music invoke shared ideals of sacrifice honor and patriotism; one televised event that features a young boy crying as he sings of his love of country ��� as an audience of dignitaries also sobs ��� is moving and disturbing." North Korea is unknowable a nation reduced to caricature by its own isolation and by cartoonish satires like last year��s James Franco-Seth Rogen comedy ���The Interview.�� The director Soon-Mi Yoo hopes to penetrate such presumptions in ���Songs From the North �� an essay built on three trips she took to the country and fortified by extensive use of archival material." born in South Korea and now on the faculty of the Massachusetts College of Arts and Design was escorted by state-supplied guides unable to travel or photograph freely.

yet the film stays mostly in shallow action-thriller waters. Ms. Blunt is impressively glum and intense but Kate is a bit of a blank on hand as a filter through which the audience can scrutinize Matt and Alejandro who are far more intriguing characters." an F.B.I. agent who is brought into the plan for reasons she doesn��t quite understand. Nor is she given much information about what��s going on once she��s on board." aided by Taylor Sheridan��s lean script Roger Deakins��s parched cinematography and Johann Johannsson��s slow-moving heart attack of a score respects the imperatives of genre while trying to avoid the usual clich�s. It��s not easy and he doesn��t entirely succeed. But he��s also trying to scramble some of the usual codes and to paint a morally complicated picture instead of restaging a morality play." threatened and enacted." the rule of law or basic human decency. As Alejandro suggests late in the film there are no good guys and bad guys in this world only packs of wolves competing for territory and dominance. ���Sicario�� suggests that United States government authorities are one such pack acting not in the name of justice or security but rather of expediency and order. The idea that the war on drugs might be won is not something anyone takes seriously. The only question is how the forces are aligned and who is enforcing the rules of engagement." menacing scenery surveyed in ���Sicario�� is real of course as are some of the aspects of its harrowing story. But the desert and the drug war ��� a landscape evoking old westerns populated with a new cast of outlaws and would-be sheriffs ��� has also become fertile pop-cultural ground. We know the territory thematic and geographic from ���No Country for Old Men�� and ���Breaking Bad �� from ���The Counselor�� and ���Traffic�� and even ���Weeds.��" ���Polytechnique �� was the almost unbearably meticulous reconstruction of an actual mass shooting at a Montreal university. He followed it with ���Incendies �� a grim family chronicle set mainly in a thinly fictionalized Lebanon during that country��s long civil war. ���Sicario �� his new movie visits a different war zone: the United States-Mexico border where the murderous business practices of the Mexican drug cartels threaten to bleed across the Rio Grande." though. Her boss (Victor Garber) hands her over to a jaunty supervisor Matt (Josh Brolin) whose organizational affiliations are unclear. (D.O.D.? C.I.A.? Something else? Are flip-flops part of the uniform?) Matt is all smiles treating possibly extralegal combat missions like pickup basketball games and answering Kate��s earnest inquiries with mock-sheepish good humor. His closest colleague ��� minion? supervisor? consultant? evil twin? ��� is a more somber fellow known as Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) haloed in sorrow and capable of extreme acts of brutality." which is not quite the same thing. A Canadian filmmaker equally comfortable in French and English he is especially interested in preludes and aftermaths in the tense moments before the eruption of violence and in the shock and confusion that follow. His framing cutting and sound design evoke the feelings that motivate and arise from the shedding of blood: rage grief steely resolve and wild panic." Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) are SWAT-team specialists who in the movie��s first scene raid a house whose walls are filled with corpses anonymous victims of the cartel who died horrible deaths before being sealed between layers of drywall. Two agents died in the raid and payback is among Kate��s motives. She wants to get the guys responsible for killing her co-workers she tells the guys responsible for the new task force." but after a while ���Sicario�� starts to feel too easy less an exploration than an exploitation of the moral ambiguities of the drug war. We glimpse mutilated bodies hanging from bridges hear stabbings and shootings just out of sight and study the face of a man whose family is being killed in front of him. But after a while these sounds and images start to feel like expressions of technique and they become at once numbing and sensational and instead of a movie about violence we��re watching another violent movie after all."

or so it would seem from the brief entry on the website of the Arizona Office of Tourism isn��t Colorado City but the ���nearby scenic attractions�� that include the Vermilion and Shinarump Cliffs. Set at the base of ravishing red cliff mountains the city and its twin Hildale Utah look straight out of Canaan. To watch ���Prophet��s Prey �� Amy Berg��s tough and disturbing documentary about a secretive polygamous Mormon fundamentalist sect with unsettling roots in the region is to grasp perhaps the unspoken reason the Arizona tourism office seems to be suggesting that visitors drive right on by." �� Ms. Berg has found an eerie counterpart to Mr. O��Grady in the person of Warren Jeffs a Mormon fundamentalist serving a life sentence for the sexual assault of two followers including a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old he impregnated. By the time he was on trial Mr. Jeffs was thought to have 78 wives including 12 who were 15 or younger when they wed." landscape beauty shots and testimonials including from former F.L.D.S. members Ms. Berg has created an unnerving sometimes infuriating documentary. She makes smart choices throughout as she weaves together this chronicle of faith and abuse but her decision to include an audio recording that was used at Mr. Jeffs��s trial of him allegedly molesting a 12-year-old girl was wrong. This decision contrasts sharply with the scene in the documentary ���Grizzly Man �� when an on-camera Werner Herzog listens to ��� but doesn��t share ��� an audio recording of the mauling death of two people. Mr. Herzog ratcheted up the drama by withholding the recording but his decision was also a de facto ethical statement about documentary and the uses of the suffering of others." �� his interest in these particular fundamentalists was sparked when in 1999 he stopped at a gas station close to Colorado City and Hildale. There he saw a group of women dressed in the sort of long prairie dresses that Laura Ingalls Wilder might have worn if she had liked frocks stitched out of pastel polyester. This curious sight led him on a journalistic investigation into Mormonism and its extremes including the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (F.L.D.S.) a breakaway sect with thousands of polygamous true believers in the United States Canada and Mexico. His book ���Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith �� hit in 2003 but Mr. Krakauer a guiding voice in the documentary is still on the case." whose earlier documentaries include ���Deliver Us From Evil �� a contemporary horror story about Oliver O��Grady a Roman Catholic priest and admitted pedophile who evaded punishment as he was moved from parish to parish for decades. He was finally defrocked and deported to Ireland after doing time in prison." though Ms. Berg gets it right burying Mr. Jeffs with persuasive witness testimony and documentation. Along the way she gestures at larger underexplored issues including the rise of homegrown religious fundamentalism in the light of rights movements for women and children. Fundamentalist Mormons are having some kind of moment including in cable shows like ���Sister Wives�� and documentaries like this one which is based on Mr. Brower��s 2011 best seller of the same title. More movies are still to come including an adaptation of ���Under the Banner of Heaven�� that is being developed by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard two of the executive producers of ���Prophet��s Prey �� and written by a third executive producer Dustin Lance Black who wrote for ���Big Love.�� The story continues." who in 2002 assumed leadership of the church after the death of his father Rulon Jeffs. With the on-camera assistance of Mr. Krakauer and Sam Brower another dogged investigator Ms. Berg fills in a harrowing portrait of Warren Jeffs as a deluded prophet and serial abuser especially of girls and women who seem locked in another century. Their old-timey look will be familiar to fans of the HBO drama ���Big Love �� about a polygamous family trying to find a middle way between faith and the modern world. In ���Prophet��s Prey�� there��s little evidence of love in what emerges as a tale of madness and abuse wealth and criminality mixed in with anti-government rhetoric ��� all in in the name of God."

From time to time we peek in on Hall��s wife Jan Arnold (Keira Knightley) who is pregnant with their first child and on Peach Weathers (Robin Wright) who shares her husband��s bluff confidence until it��s time to start worrying." the stakes should be high and the drama intense as human beings battle the brute forces of nature in a life-or-death struggle. But though it assembles a first-rate cast in a story taken from reality ���Everest�� feels icebound and strangely abstract lacking the gravity of genuine tragedy or the swagger of first-rate adventure." an Icelandic director whose films include ���Jar City�� and ���2 Guns �� hits his stride once the preliminary conversations and expository scenes give way to practical decisions and perilous mishaps. As his camera swoops down on the climbers from above ��� and on a few vertiginous occasions from below ��� you feel some of the grandeur and terror of their undertaking. They are small slow-moving creatures their bright-colored gear vivid and incongruous amid the sparkling whites and swirling grays of snow cloud and wind.

The individual climbers who receive most of our attention are treated with empathy and respect ��� the Westerners that is; the Nepalese Sherpas who guide and assist them barely figure at all ��� but Everest itself is a mob scene.

Professional tour leaders are expected to ensure the safety of clients who insist on pushing toward the summit despite potentially fatal risks." a stoic disciplined New Zealander played by the ever-solid Jason Clarke; and Scott Fischer a gonzo American played with marvelous mischief by Jake Gyllenhaal. Their ascent in the spring of 1996 during which eight people died and many others suffered severe frostbite was the subject of Jon Krakauer��s best-selling book ���Into Thin Air.��" written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy tells a somewhat different version of the story with Mr. Krakauer (Michael Kelly) as a marginal and not entirely sympathetic character. His participation in the climb as a writer working on an article for Outside magazine is part of the competition between Hall and Fischer. Both climbers crave the publicity a magazine feature would bring even though Hall is also aware that such attention is contributing to dangerous and unpleasant conditions on the mountain." Krakauer asks members of Hall��s expedition why they are there and though their answers are potted or evasive ���Everest�� fills in some of the blanks. Beck Weathers a gung-ho Texan played by Josh Brolin eventually lets his bravado slip and admits that the malaise that plagues him in daily life dissipates in challenging conditions at high altitudes. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) a quiet postal worker who has tried and failed to reach the top of Everest before is seeking a fulfillment that eludes him elsewhere. Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) the only woman in Hall��s group has already climbed six of the seven highest mountains in the world and needs Everest to complete the set." ���Everest�� gets stuck between celebrating the indomitability of the human spirit and reckoning with the awful consequences of hubris and bad luck. It aspires to something large and lofty but in the end it��s a big pile of rocks ice and vain and valiant human effort." at any rate ��� but maybe not a good enough reason to see a movie.

Technically of course a film isn��t really ���there�� until someone makes it and ���Everest �� a breathless large-scale 3-D action spectacle (directed by Baltasar Kormakur) about an ill-starred attempt to scale the planet��s highest peak was called into being with impressive star power and technical bravura.

He sips ginger ale from a bottle while his colleagues down shots and pints of beer and speaks in a fierce whisper. He is nice to old ladies on the street devoted to his mother and brother and shows himself to be a doting (and then a grieving) father.

James J. Bulger was in the 1970s and ��80s Boston��s most notorious criminal. While his younger brother William served as president of the Massachusetts State Senate James (referred to as Whitey though he disliked the nickname) ran the Winter Hill Gang an especially vicious enterprise in a business not known for delicacy. He also enjoyed a cozy relationship with the local office of the F.B.I. which turned a blind eye to his crimes in exchange for information about the activities of his rivals." as usual by colorful thugs with rougher faces and thicker accents. (Hey guys can we give Boston a rest as a crime-movie backdrop and maybe try Chicago for a while? I say this as a former resident of both cities and a longtime fan of the letter R.) The episodic narrative is framed by testimony from some of Jimmy��s former underlings who turned on him when a new prosecutor (Corey Stoll) came to town. Jesse Plemons as Kevin Weeks Rory Cochrane as Steve Flemmi and W. Earl Brown as the slow-moving hit man John Martorano are all credibly gamy and mean and the matter-of-factness of their testimony is the best most honest part of the movie." at the margins of the story of Julianne Nicholson (as Connolly��s wife Marianne) Dakota Johnson (as Lindsey Cyr the mother of Jimmy��s son) and Juno Temple (as Deborah Hussey a young victim of Whitey��s paranoia) exposes the limitations of the film��s angle of vision on the world its characters occupy. We��re in historically masculine genre territory of course but this movie��s collection of mothers wives and mistresses is especially threadbare. More boilerplate." and his story all but begs for a movie. Some elements of it have already made it to the screen. ���The Departed �� Martin Scorsese��s remake of a classic Hong Kong crime film incorporates aspects of the Whitey Bulger legend. ���Whitey �� Joe Berlinger��s solid documentary looks squarely in the faces of his victims and their families dispelling some of the aura of gangster romance that always seems to surround white ethnic practitioners of organized crime." and I��m as susceptible as any other deskbound conflict-averse fantasist to the visceral appeal of a good gangster movie. But ���Black Mass�� isn��t one. Mr. Cooper��s direction is skillful if overly reliant on borrowed Scorseseisms (especially when it comes to music) and the cast is first-rate but the film is a muddle of secondhand attitudes and half-baked ideas. It feels more like a costume party than a costume drama." though to think of the shortcomings of ���Black Mass�� as fitting comeuppance for Mr. Bulger. He may have thought he was a big deal but in the end all he merits is a minor gangster movie." where Jimmy��s boyhood pal John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) has set himself up as the scourge of the Italian mob while also serving as Whitey��s inside man. Mr. Edgerton��s hot-blooded strutting and shouting contrasts intriguingly with Mr. Depp��s chilly reserve but Connolly remains a one-dimensional character a garish bad apple in a barrel full of mostly honest but fatefully credulous lawmen. (His office mates and superiors are played by Kevin Bacon Adam Scott and David Harbour as John Morris who follows Connolly down Whitey��s rabbit hole.)" �� Scott Cooper��s new film puts some of that luster back. It��s not that Mr. Cooper necessarily set out to portray Mr. Bulger as a charismatic antihero whose actions are both appalling and exciting. (The screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth is based on the book by the reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O��Neill of The Boston Globe.) His protagonist played by Johnny Depp and called Jimmy by most of his friends and associates does terrible unforgivable things nearly all of which the real Mr. Bulger actually did. But the conventions of popular culture conventions to which Mr. Cooper hews with slavish or perhaps unthinking devotion treat those things with a certain reverence.

While ���Peace Officer�� could offer more information what is here is disturbing and sometimes eye-opening." ���Peace Officer�� does little to examine the impact of race on the deployment of force and by emphasizing drug enforcement it skirts the role of the Sept. 11 attacks in augmenting police militarization.

In 1975 Mr. Lawrence started the first SWAT unit in Davis County. Decades later he got a new perspective on the results: In September 2008 his son-in-law Brian Wood was killed by a member of that unit in a standoff after a fight with Mr. Lawrence��s daughter. Mr. Lawrence saw the killing as a wildly overzealous reaction that flew in the face of expectations of police professionalism and training and he resolved to determine exactly what happened." �� a documentary about the militarization of law enforcement is nothing if not timely though its focus is mostly confined to one state."

They provide some national context through interviews with experts on that issue like Kara Dansky a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union and Radley Balko who writes a blog for The Washington Post.

Too bad.

The movie��s impressiveness though lies less in its ingenuity with superglue and cockroaches than its patient mastery of tone and particularly its visual richness.

When it��s over even those who have guessed its final twist (because we have seen it before) will immediately want to watch again if only to check the logic of its shifting points of view." ���Goodnight Mommy�� gains significant traction from small moments: an eerily depopulated village; a glimpse of exposed tissue; a single malevolently bloodshot eye." but that doesn��t mean anyone here has the slightest chance of sleeping." the story (by the directors Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala) centers on twin boys Lukas and Elias (Lukas and Elias Schwarz). Preteen and preternaturally beautiful the boys lead a paradisiacal existence frolicking in golden cornfields beneath unblemished skies. They are oddly unsupervised playing alone until their mother (Susanne Wuest) returns from a hospital head wreathed in bandages like another kind of mummy.

As the movie��s title suggests he has lost track of the chronology that connects that past and his uprooted present. While ���Time Out of Mind�� traces a few months in his life from winter to spring you can��t always tell how much time has passed from one scene to the next. A few minutes? A week?

When the shot changes it can be hard at first to find George in the frame. He��s huddled in a corner or hunkered down in a crowd or half-hidden on the far side of a window or a street. The soundtrack hums with New York sounds and half-heard partial New York conversations ��� arguments negotiations bull sessions ��� few of which concern George.

But those moments are fleeting and the longed-for epiphany never arrives. Usually George��s features are slack his sentences mumbled and incomplete his eyes cloudy under heavy brows. His vague personality seems to reflect drifting circumstances; he is a creature of negative space." partly because he refuses to solicit sympathy or even attention. ���Time Out of Mind�� is an intimate portrait of a man caught between the desire to be left alone and a need for human connection. George retreats from people. It can seem as if he��s trying to escape from the movie itself and that Mr. Moverman��s camera is tracking him from a careful tactful distance unwilling to let him disappear entirely even if that may be what he wants most. The meaning of George��s existence escapes him and us too.

Shortly after his plans were revealed by the Southern Poverty Law Center a white supremacist family moved to Leith to fix up the properties." the residents pass laws denying them occupancy of the properties because they lack running water and sewage systems.

Instead it stuffs an entire encyclopedia of dicey ideas (visual narrative political) into a blender to create a wacky eyeball-popping and -glazing extravaganza that suggests a Cecil B.

And while it can be tough to find the human pulse amid the spectacle noise Jackie Chan John Cusack Adrien Brody and a trillion horse-riding extras are also part of the very big picture." too though none as jaw-slackening as the performances from Mr. Cusack and Mr. Brody. Mr. Cusack plays General Lucius who has ended up on the Silk Road in an effort to protect Publius (Jozef Liu Waite) the warbling babe from his older brother General Tiberius (Mr. Brody). Mr. Brody either took his role seriously or can keep a straight face better than Mr. Cusack whose contortionist expressions tend to suggest someone desperate not to let loose either laughter or bowels. Mr. Brody by contrast takes to his villainous role with old-fashioned Basil Rathbone hauteur swaggering and twirling while leading with his profile. At one point Mr. Brody even runs his tongue over his bloody hand as if to acknowledge just how finger-licking good his role is." it is also about putting on a really big show with your pals who here include both the fantastically outfitted constituencies of 36 nations who swirl around the Silk Road and a legion of Roman soldiers who materialize on it one day having apparently taken a wrong turn on the Appian Way. The clotted story involves how these different groups are juggled with a broad smile and some fancy footwork by Huo An (Mr. Chan) the leader of the Silk Road guard.

For starters it is a Jackie Chan vehicle a period story a Chinese production and a huge 2015 box-office hit in the People��s Republic. (It opened in China in February.) Written and directed by the genre-smashing Daniel Lee who has epic DeMille-level ambitions the movie takes place in the first part of the Han dynasty when the court supported by its elites ruled its far-flung empire with military muscle and bureaucratic administration. So the movie which involves a government squad protecting the Silk Road may be a resonant topical metaphor ��� or not." even if he still dodges and darts with elastic grace. His character is on the dull side and is mostly a hub for all the swirling parts that Mr. Lee puts into motion. There are many of these because Mr. Lee like Michael Bay and other specialists in the art of cinematic mayhem likes to throw everything at the screen that a monster budget can give him. And other than women ���Dragon Blade�� has a whole lot of everything including armies of extras herds of horses truckloads of feathered-and-furred costumes bushels of strikingly styled hair innumerable crane shots and choreographed fights.

But Mr. Gibney has produced his own penetrating cultural commentary amid the smorgasbord of interviews and archival Jobsiana braiding together tough questions about the particular modern world Mr. Jobs helped create." Mr. Gibney has also skewered Apple��s marketing of its consumer devices as a form of creative expression (���Think Different��) and has drawn out the dissonance between that individuality and the danger of self-absorption.

The chronicle commences in 1966 as the civil rights movement begins to shift beyond the South and into a new phase of militancy.

They managed at least for a time to be both glamorous and grass-roots and to put a scare into what was known in those days as the white power structure." partly inspired by Stokely Carmichael��s rhetoric of black power began organizing activists to confront the local police with guns. The intention was at least at first not violence but vigilance and the exercise of rights guaranteed by the California Penal Code and the Second Amendment. When a group of Panthers demonstrated at the Statehouse in Sacramento carrying loaded rifles and shotguns the organization drew national news attention and (at least temporarily) rallied many political conservatives including Gov. Ronald Reagan to the cause of gun control." �� Stanley Nelson��s excellent new documentary includes a television news report on tensions between black citizens and the police in American cities. If not for the fuzzy monochrome images and the voice-over��s unironic use of the word ���Negroes �� the clip could have been broadcast last week instead of almost 50 years ago. And if Mr. Nelson doesn��t strain to establish the present-day relevance of the story he has to tell it��s partly because he doesn��t have to. The problems of poverty police brutality and economic plunder that gave birth to the Panthers are with us still." the director of the F.B.I. designated the Black Panthers a nationalist hate group and would soon declare them ���the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.�� Most of the activity of his bureau��s notorious counterintelligence program (known as Cointelpro) was devoted to trying to disrupt divide and destroy the Panthers. Hoover was particularly concerned with preventing a black ���messiah�� from rising within the party��s ranks and uniting blacks with white radicals on college campuses and in the antiwar movement into a potentially revolutionary force." as Mr. Nelson shows was a more complicated affair and his film captures the drama of their rise and fall without sacrificing the nuances the shifting play of strategy and tactics means and ends personalities and procedures. He talks to a handful of historians journalists and law enforcement officers but the bulk of the testimony ��� rousing rueful funny and frank ��� comes from within the Black Panther rank and file." �� which is certainly how the Panthers came to envision themselves. But the revolution that unfolded in their wake was the one that took Reagan to the White House and that has frequently taken pains to disguise its origins in racial backlash politics." and Mr. Nelson makes a strong case for their importance as both a political and a cultural force. They helped to popularize the slogan ���black is beautiful�� and to promote an aesthetic of pride and self-sufficiency. It��s easy enough in hindsight to romanticize the charisma of the Panthers and their leaders or to criticize them for focusing on self-presentation and imagery rather than on more substantive issues. But what is clear from this sober yet electrifying film is that the power of the Panthers was rooted in their insistence ��� radical then radical still ��� that black lives matter." subterfuge and the courts ��� and an object lesson in the vulnerability of political resistance. Pressed from the outside by the F.B.I. and local police departments the Panthers suffered from the factionalism disorganization and personality cults that so often afflict oppositional movements. Their fall is a sad tale one that casts a shadow over the defiant energy of their beginnings." like Kathleen Cleaver who was married to Eldridge Cleaver from 1967 to 1987 and Elaine Brown head of the party from 1974-1977. (Ms. Brown author of a memoir of her time in the party called ���A Taste of Power �� has accused Mr. Nelson of turning ���the history of the Black Panther Party into a two-dimensional palliative for white people and Negroes who are comfortable in America��s oppressive status quo.��) Mr. Newton whose 1968 manslaughter conviction made ���Free Huey�� a rallying cry for the New Left died in 1989 in a gunfight on an Oakland street. Mr. Cleaver who left the United States in 1968 to escape arrest on attempted murder charges after a shootout with the Oakland police and who became a conservative Republican after returning from his exile died in 1998. Mr. Seale is not interviewed in the film. But the absence of firsthand testimony from these three leaders doesn��t limit the film��s scope. Instead it allows us to see them through the eyes of their followers and to see from a distance how they reflected the passions of their moment."

The men ��� Robert Redford and Nick Nolte ��� are slumbering in their tents when the bears descend and begin tearing into the hikers�� food which they have failed to properly stash. The bears roar and the men thunder back flapping uvulas and arms to chase off the animals. It��s a mildly funny scene partly because of its light physical comedy and sight gaggery although also because Mr. Nolte his signature growl now often at sepulchral depths has been doing a fair impression of a wild beast for years." who has directed movies like ���The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants�� (a title that seems to cry out for a regulation joke about this one��s brotherhood) has signed his name to ���A Walk in the Woods.�� Its more obvious authorial presence though is Mr. Redford who makes an appealing modestly glamorized and fictionalized (and older) Bill Bryson. Mr. Redford has been trying to adapt the book for more than a decade but if this was a passion project whatever hunger or even itch it once activated in him isn��t much evident on screen. The scenery is obviously beautiful if as neatly framed as a postcard and the movie generally agreeable despite some cartoonish women who are as moldy as an old Playboy joke page.

Women tend to be a distraction and a source of comedy throughout the movie and in the case of Emma Thompson as Catherine Bryson��s hen-clucker of a wife a modest salvation from an overload of grumpy old man shtick. Ms. Thompson helps rev up the story which opens shortly before Bryson decides to go on his big adventure with a jokey scene of him being grilled on a talk show. It��s a mildly affronting experience that ��� as with some other signifiers of the modern world a child��s noisy video game included ��� seems to help push him into nature." even if the movie largely refuses to tackle anything weightier than creaking bones and resilient libido. Mr. Kwapis and the screenwriters Bill Holderman and Rick Kerb wrest light laughs out of their stars�� advanced ages ��� Mr. Redford is now 79 Mr. Nolte 74 ��� and it��s vaguely amusing to watch Bryson and Katz huff and puff through their first stretch of trail as children swarm past them like gnats. (Why the men don��t pull out the walking sticks poking out of their packs remains a mystery.) Mostly though it is unexpectedly moving and occasionally delightful to spend time with these titans of cinema as they walk and sometimes wobble delivering words that become meaningful because they��re lucky enough to be spoken by Mr. Redford and Mr. Nolte." 1998 nonfiction chronicle about his own Appalachian tramp which he started with an old friend Stephen Katz (a pseudonymous character played by Mr. Nolte) when they were both 44.

lycanthropy has typically been a guy thing. For the hapless Eisenhower-era protagonist of ���I Was a Teenage Werewolf�� and for the studly Jacob Black in the ���Twilight�� movies sprouting fur fangs and claws was a metaphor for uncontrollable adolescent male rage. But girls are angry too and the teenage werewolf in ���When Animals Dream �� a spare and smart Danish thriller comes of age in particularly infuriating circumstances." Marie (Sonia Suhl) must contend with some alarming physical and mental changes. She notices odd hairy patches on her chest and back. Her temper has grown shorter and more violent. Her dreams are bloody. Her father (Lars Mikkelsen) and the local doctor (Stig Hoffmeyer) an elderly man are aware of what��s going on but they also seem to be hiding the truth and Marie��s mother (Sonja Richter) who sits silent in a wheelchair heavily drugged because of an unexplained affliction can��t supply maternal advice." and nearly all the exposition is handled by precise imagery and efficient editing. Mr. Arnby knows all the genre codes and how to subvert them when necessary." the connection between Marie��s condition and her mother��s is explained but in the midst of trying to understand what��s happening to her Marie endures taunting and harassment from the men at the fish processing plant where she works. They shove her into a vat of rotting fish carcasses as part of an initiation ritual and look at her with barely disguised predatory interest. Not that she is simply a passive victim. She has her eye on a young man named Daniel (Jakob Oftebro) who serves as the film��s reminder that not all men are misogynist jerks." its scope is modest and it is in the end more touching than terrifying intent on jolting its audience not with dread but with compassion." Ms. Suhl doesn��t look especially frightening ��� instead of howling at the moon she seethes quietly ��� but the contrast between Marie��s frail appearance and her latent ferocity is crucial to the film��s emotional power and its feminist themes. It��s partly a movie about the male terror of female sexuality and the lengths that men will go to tame and suppress a force that threatens their control of the world. That Marie turns out to be a werewolf is both a confirmation of patriarchal fears and a convenient excuse for the men who would be inclined to mistreat her anyway." ���When Animals Dream�� is moody and austere. Like the recent Swedish vampire film ���Let the Right One In�� (and its English remake ���Let Me In��) it regards its monstrous heroine with empathy rather than horror. And like the unnamed Girl in Ana Lily Amirpour��s ���A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night�� (speaking of vampires) Marie a quiet and fine-boned teenager living with her parents on a windswept island is a figure of righteous vengeance."

Mr. Perry does a great deal with his hybrid visual style emotional palette restricted location and a minimal cast that includes a very good Patrick Fugit as Virginia��s neighbor. The story folds in several time frames including the days of Catherine��s visit that are announced on screen in red elegant typeface. The typeface was designed by Teddy Blanks who created the Philip Rothian books strewn through Mr. Perry��s last feature ���Listen Up Philip �� a few of which ��� ���Madness & Women�� included ��� pop up in ���Queen of Earth.�� As beautiful and slashing as Catherine and Virginia the typeface looks similar to the one in Rainer Werner Fassbinder��s ���The Marriage of Maria Braun �� one of the classics that inform Mr. Perry��s work here." these close-ups are alternately mesmerizing and suffocating which dovetails with Mr. Perry��s pull-push strategy of bringing you uncomfortably close to the action to the tears and the drama only to shove you away. Some of this may be a matter of artistic temperament and Mr. Perry��s interest in exploring the more rancid manifestations of human behavior but it also serves his narrative experimentation here. ���Queen of Earth�� largely focuses on Catherine during a summer visit with her ostensible best friend Virginia (Katherine Waterston) who��s been given the keys to a country retreat belonging to relatives. And while Catherine may be ready to lick her wounds she doesn��t stand a chance given how deeply Virginia jabs her fingers in them." she��s looking upward her teary blotchy face filling the frame.

All that��s missing is the black velvet background." �� whom Susan Sontag described as ���engaged in a desperate duel of identities�� ��� a nice concise description of what happens in ���Queen of Earth�� too. In ���Persona �� a mute patient and a talkative nurse circle each other in what Sontag also described as ���the duel between two mythical parts of a single self.�� It��s worth nothing that someone in ���Queen of Earth�� has put a statue of two fencers in the room that Catherine stays in and where she retreats into herself. It��s there that she stares down plates of wilted salad that would make suitable appetizers for the putrefying rabbit (a would-be dinner) that haunts Catherine Deneuve in Roman Polanski��s ���Repulsion �� yet another touchstone about crazy women and the male directors who love them." �� her frown has turned upside down and a grimace of abject misery has transformed into a vision of manic happiness as if she had traded in her tragedy mask for a comedy one. That it��s unclear which face is scarier more unnerving is in keeping with the director Alex Ross Perry��s gift for destabilization for setting a mood only to violently upend it with cutting looks dissonant musical chords and off-kilter camera angles. That Catherine seems to be swapping theater masks even as Ms. Moss brings tremendous depth of feeling to the role is in line with the arch self-consciousness of ���Queen of Earth �� an art film in quotation marks." Sean Price Williams oscillate between fixed and moving cameras and there��s a terrific scene in which the camera shifts from Catherine to Virginia and back again as each shares a defining story. Ms. Waterston a Modigliani in motion and often in black easily holds your attention but it is Ms. Moss with her intimate expressivity who annihilates you from first tear to last crushing laugh." art cinema included. The wellspring for Catherine��s opening waterworks is twofold: Her beloved father a famous painter has recently died and her lover James (Kentucker Audley all smiles and spinelessness) is now leaving her for another woman. In many contemporary movies the director would cut back and forth between Catherine and James��s faces during this scene for a typical shot reverse-shot exchange. Often the camera would make like Tinker Bell flitting between the characters to peek from behind one and gawp at the other. Mr. Perry avoids over-the-shoulder shots but as suggested by the opener that turns Catherine��s face into a landscape of pain he likes claustrophobic close-ups." who��s content to skim the surface rather than break it comes across like an exceptionally gifted student trying his hand at art-cinema pastiche. To that end it can be entertaining to watch him flip through its playbook trying out oblique angles and off-center staging while the composer Keegan DeWitt��s dissonant mood-altering score samples the Euro-style hits."

Bong Joon-ho��s ���Snowpiercer�� imagined that the entire population of the world had been packed into a very long very fast train sorted by status and function and governed by a strict set of policies. ���The Iron Ministry �� J. P. Sniadecki��s new film could almost be described as the documentary version of Mr. Bong��s dystopian futuristic fantasy. Mr. Sniadecki��s trains which criss-cross China and on which he spent nearly three years filming doesn��t quite hold all of humanity. It just feels that way." which is just to say that it��s not a long trip through a faraway country. It��s a work of art ��� vivid and mysterious and full of life." and it��s somehow both disgusting and alluring. Huge slabs of fatty pork are carefully cut rolled and hung on wires to be sold alongside fruits and vegetables by farmers from market towns along the route." the train would be at the top probably followed by the horse. Car chases are cool and everything but the very first publicly shown movie (at least according to legend) was about a train. Trains on film are both sublime and intimate: The camera can trace the muscular movement of railway cars across the land or venture inside to observe the complicated actions of people in motion." �� for example which takes place on a commercial fishing trawler ��� the viewer plunges into a strange intense reality and almost drowns in it. To me ���The Iron Ministry�� is a more interesting movie partly because for all its immediacy it allows you a certain analytic distance from its subject. In other words you can think about what you��re seeing and hearing and glean nuggets of meaning from what can seem like random encounters and observations." films that trace the effects of that country��s social economic and technological transformation on its workers peasants students and entrepreneurs. While ���The Iron Ministry�� stands perfectly well on its own it is also an illuminating companion to a movie like Lixin Fan��s ���Last Train Home �� about the migration from rural villages to urban factories." which carries tens of millions of people across China every year. His attempt to find more affluent citizens of the People��s Republic are thwarted when conductors shoo him out of a first-class dining car. Back in the cheap seats in the coach-class sleeping cars in the noisy smoking areas outside the lavatories people talk about the hope of finding better jobs in newly built cities about the frustrations of a bureaucratic undemocratic system and (at least in one instance) about the wisdom and decency of China��s rulers. They also manage to fall asleep in what look like impossible positions and to find ways to amuse themselves and one another amid the tedium and claustrophobia."

Only when her marriage ends does she realize that she has to learn to drive if she wants to visit her fiery college-age daughter Tasha (Grace Gummer) on a farm in Vermont." and in ���Learning to Drive �� his demeanor is benign but not holy. With his stiff-backed posture and alert expression he projects an unflappable self-control even when Wendy has a near-meltdown on the Queensboro Bridge.

This is a story about what almost happens what might happen and what is happening under the banal surface of things.

He doesn��t necessarily have a lot to say but he always makes sure that he knows what he��s talking about." and they quarrel about that.

The house a rustic rambling beautiful pile in the hills of Malibu Calif. belongs to a client of Lee��s who is off somewhere shooting a movie." and a good deal of suspense comes from wondering just when some of those intriguing names will show up.

Mr. Swanberg shares Mr. Allen��s abiding interest in the swerves and reversals of romance but he conducts his investigations on firmer moral and philosophical ground. His characters evince mumbling anomie rather than eloquent neurosis.

For more than 30 years Elle shared her life with Vi whose relatively recent death casts a long shadow over Elle��s daily routines. In the first few scenes we see Elle brutally dumping her younger lover Olivia (Ms. Greer) and then weeping alone in the shower once Olivia has left. Bereavement it seems has set Elle firmly in her solitary sarcastic ways. She doesn��t talk much to Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) the daughter she and Vi raised together and is therefore somewhat startled when Judy��s daughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up at her door in need of help." but it would be a pretty good start." and worth acknowledging Ms. Tomlin��s status as a foremother ��� a big sister a wild aunt however you want to put it ��� of the frank fearless funny women who have recently rescued American humor from its bro��ed-out doldrums. Tina Fey the Amys (Poehler and Schumer) the ladies of ���Broad City�� and the shape-shifters of the current ���Saturday Night Live�� cast did not come out of nowhere. To revisit Ms. Tomlin��s old LPs or videos of her one-woman shows is no more a matter of nostalgia than Elle��s embrace of de Beauvoir and Friedan. It��s a matter of memory of understanding the continuities and ruptures of history. And that��s the truth." but as of this writing one thing that is absolutely right with the world is the existence of ���Grandma �� Paul Weitz��s wry and insightful movie about an eventful day in the life of Elle and her granddaughter. There is much to praise about this sweet smart comedy of intergenerational conflict and solidarity: the way the script captures the speech patterns of the young the old and the middle age; the way the story feels at once frantic and relaxed as the two main characters race against the clock and meander through Los Angeles in Elle��s wheezy vintage car; the brief memorable appearances from supporting performers like Judy Greer Sam Elliott and Elizabeth Pe�a (in one of her last roles). But honestly the wonder that is ���Grandma�� can be summed up in two words: Lily Tomlin." �� Mr. Weitz��s uneven and unsatisfying 2013 comedy. ���Grandma�� is a much more lucid film less crowded with story points and more open to the idiosyncrasies of its characters. It regards them all in particular Sage Judy and Elle with clarity and sympathy acknowledging the distinct risks and opportunities each one faces as she tries to pursue happiness and avoid compromise." �� Sage says to her grandmother. The word she��s looking for is misanthrope but of course there is a core of tenderness and generosity underneath Elle��s caustic surface. That might be the wrong way to put it. What Mr. Weitz and Ms. Tomlin understand about the character and about many other feminists of her generation is that her grouchiness and her compassion issue from the same source. She is impatient with the world and suspicious of the motives of a lot of people in it but that is partly a result of her idealism her uncompromising commitment to behaving like a free human being."

When they meet it is obvious that they are compatible. At the very moment when ���People Places Things�� has a chance to soar it turns prissy indecisive and picayune. The story meanders along with too-cute scenes of Will bonding with his daughters. Meanwhile Charlie now pregnant plans to get married." ���People Places Things�� seems at odds with itself. It is realistic about New York place names yet disconnected from reality. Will who is handsome in an appealingly scruffy way is a faithful husband with a warm self-deprecating sense of humor and an acute roving intelligence.

But Dee though shot is still alive and Hazel who has witnessed the carnage from a concealed spot must surmount her fears to seek help in the wilderness." and the director Jorge Michel Grau working with the cinematographer Santiago S��nchez skillfully suggests the vertiginous unease Hazel experiences with her tentative steps into the vast threatening landscape.

Charlotte is at once present and not and few other adults are of any help to Minnie including her mother��s former squeeze Pascal (Christopher Meloni). Not that Minnie who keeps her own counsel no matter how unwise would pay attention. As the title announces the movie isn��t about the arguments of lawyers judges or any other guardians of the moral galaxy any more than it��s about questionable child rearing predatory men and regrettable girlfriends. It is the diary of a specific complex sometimes muddled teenager who owns her story her life and her pleasure from the moment she says ���I had sex today �� to her rueful hopeful closing declaration of self." Ms. Heller extracted the story from Phoebe Gloeckner��s trippy autobiographically informed novel of the same title. Both versions of the story follow Minnie as she rides out adolescence which goes very dark in Ms. Gloeckner��s novel. Ms. Heller plays down or elides its more harrowing episodes (rape hard drugs) and sweetens the overarching narrative by emphasizing its comic absurdity. She also embellishes the movie with cartoon hearts and flowers that wouldn��t be out of place in Disney��s ���Snow White.�� Truer to the novel��s spirit she brings in (via the animator Sara Gunnarsdottir) an illustrated version of Aline Kominsky-Crumb a.k.a. Mrs. Crumb a feminist cartoonist who pops into the picture and functions as part imaginary friend part groovy fairy godmother." other than an expletive depends on what you call a man having sex with a 15-year-old girl. ���The Diary of a Teenage Girl�� takes place in 1976 when the age of consent in California was 18 (it still is) but it unfolds in an anything-goes milieu in which Monroe might be branded more of an opportunist than a creep. Drinks and pot smoke flow through its rooms in between snorts of cocaine. Charlotte works as a librarian and parties like well someone with no children having apparently traded in Dr. Spock for Dr. Feelgood. In her hedonism if mostly in her egotism (it��s all about her) Charlotte comes off like a case study for ���The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations �� Christopher Lasch��s 1979 era-defining classic." but looks more like a teenager than most of the generically buffed and prettified adolescents who populate American screens. She has the wide-open look children have before life gets in the way. But she��s on the short side and is dwarfed by Kristen Wiig (great) who plays Charlotte Minnie��s boozy inattentive mother. Ms. Powley looks almost doll-like Lilliputian when staring up at Alexander Skarsgard (a perfect worm) who plays Monroe a mustachioed loafer with pitiful self-improvement plans. He��s Charlotte��s boyfriend when the movie opens and he��s also sleeping with the very willing all-too-eager Minnie although calling him her lover doesn��t seem quite right ��� but neither does predator." and Monroe the villain even if that��s not at all how it plays out in the movie. Monroe may not be exactly the light of Minnie��s life but for much of the story he is the fire of her loins to borrow and bend some opening words from Nabokov��s ���Lolita.�� In the preface to a later edition of her novel Ms. Gloeckner writes that in many ways it is about her but that it��s also about the reader. ���Although I am the source of Minnie she cannot be me ��� for the book to have real meaning she must be all girls anyone.�� It��s a familiar universal appeal and also insistently political. The novel is life-specific but what makes Minnie ��� on the page and now on the screen ��� greater than any one girl is how she tells her own story in her own soaringly alive voice." and often an affectingly honest hormone bomb waiting to explode. Minnie looks together when you first meet her sailing through a city park with a Cheshire cat smile her saucer eyes bugging as she takes in the local color (facial hair and liberated jauntily bouncing breasts) that starts to set the freewheeling at times freaky San Francisco scene. Once back in her bedroom ��� where a large poster of a bare-chested Iggy Pop watches over her next to a photo of Janis Joplin ��� Minnie begins making audiotapes using a recorder as a diary into which she can pour her desires dreams fears and thrillingly dirty secrets." the 15-year-old heroine of ���The Diary of a Teenage Girl �� is a would-be cartoonist who despite her first name is closer in lusty spirit and scratchy pen to Robert Crumb than to Walt Disney. When partway through this gutsy exhilarating movie she draws her first cartoon it��s of a bodacious female colossus striding across San Francisco. As this inky giant keeps on trucking she evokes the 50-foot-woman of cult film fame if one that has received a Crumb makeover with thighs as mighty as giant sequoias and a bottom that rolls like a ship in a storm." assuming that they come to this movie with their own ideas on the subject. She knows you can fill in all kinds of blanks including the explicit details of Minnie and Monroe��s encounters. Her discretion is a commercially expedient choice of course; Ms. Heller wants to turn you on rather than off. But she also wants to be true to Minnie. Given this it��s important that the one time you see Minnie fully naked is when she��s alone with her body and thoughts in her bedroom gazing into a mirror. She may be the object of Monroe��s lust (and he is unambiguously hers) but Ms. Heller ensures that Minnie ��� who��s never lighted or framed for the viewer��s erotic contemplation ��� isn��t ours."

Ricki is an outspoken Obama-hater with a Tea Party tattoo across her back and she has no trouble reconciling the rebellious music of the past with right-wing politics in the present. But the actual content of her views is never explored and the gap between them and those of her abandoned family is hinted at rather than dramatized. A confrontation between Ricki and Maureen ��� a black woman who has been the de facto mother of Ricki��s children for most of their lives ��� simmers with all kinds of implications racial and otherwise.

It would be a spoiler to say too much about the number that ends the movie a Bruce Springsteen cover but the opener sung to a sparse appreciative audience at a scruffy club in Tarzana Calif. is a competent version of an old hit by Tom Petty. (If that name doesn��t ring a bell go ask your dad.)

We don��t necessarily need to see Ms. Streep and Ms. McDonald trading slurs and accusations but two such formidable performers should be allowed to give us something more than tentative evasive exchanges. Unlike ���Rachel Getting Married �� Mr. Demme��s earlier tale of a wayward relative returning to the family fold ���Ricki and the Flash�� tiptoes around like a barefoot child afraid to step on a thorn.

a new probationary hire at Rolling Stone magazine convinces his skeptical editor (Ron Livingston) that David F.W. is worthy of a feature article and so finds himself in Bloomington Ill. in the middle of winter. (Wallace taught for many years at Illinois State University.) The plan is that the reporter will accompany the novelist to Minneapolis the last stop on his book tour. He does and that��s pretty much the plot of the movie." David Lipsky might be a great guy but on screen he is played by Mr. Eisenberg which means that his genetic material is at least 25 percent weasel. Wallace at one point playfully describes himself as ���pleasantly unpleasant.�� Lipsky is unpleasantly pleasant which is much worse. Twitchy and ingratiating he wants to be a tough journalist and a pal. He desperately wants Wallace to regard him as a peer and can hardly contain his jealousy. He berates Sarah after she chats with Wallace on the phone and falls into a defensive snit after Wallace accuses him of flirting with Betsy (Mickey Sumner) a poet who had known Wallace in graduate school." which takes place in 1996. Both of them are writers. One is Wallace (Jason Segel) whose third book of fiction the 1 079-page dystopian tennis-rehab epic ���Infinite Jest �� has just been published to hyperbolic acclaim. The other is David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) whose own recently released novel ���The Art Fair �� has met with polite indifference. An early scene finds him on his couch reading ���Infinite Jest�� while his girlfriend Sarah (Anna Chlumsky) is curled up with the season��s other fictional blockbuster the anonymously published political roman �� clef ���Primary Colors.�� (Oh the ��90s. Sorry you missed all the fun kids. Kind of sorry I didn��t.)" who committed suicide in 2008 have condemned the movie sight unseen and friends of his who did see it (one of them also a friend of mine) have found fault with both its details and its overall design. As an ardent ambivalent reader of Wallace��s prose and a complete stranger to him personally I can only respect such objections. But the movie in my view disarms them ��� not because it offers an especially loving or lifelike picture of its subject but rather because David Foster Wallace is not really its subject at all. ���The End of the Tour�� is at once an exercise in post-postmodern literary mythmaking and an unsparing demolition of the contemporary mythology of the writer. It��s ultimately a movie ��� one of the most rigorous and thoughtful I��ve seen ��� about the ethical and existential traps our fame-crazed culture sets for the talented and the mediocre alike." which is to say wishing that ���The End of the Tour�� didn��t exist even as you hang on its every word and revel in its rough vernacular beauty. In an ideal world we would all sit at home reading ���Infinite Jest�� and then go out to eat hamburgers argue about philosophy and watch cheesy action blockbusters. There would be no pseudo-authoritative biographies or prying preening magazine profiles to complicate our pleasures and ambitious actors would not dare to impersonate beloved novelists. But the world we live in is plagued by all of those things. There will always be films about writers and writing and this one is just about as good as it gets." uttered into Mr. Lipsky��s tape recorder in 1996 and transcribed 14 years later for publication in a book called ���Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself.�� Funny intriguing and revealing as this talk may be it does not have anything like the status of Wallace��s writing. The film not only acknowledges this distinction but it also insists on it. In his would-be profiler��s company occasionally glancing at the menacing red light of the predigital tape recorder Wallace is by turns cagey and candid witty and earnest but he is always aware at times painfully that he is playing the role of a writer in someone else��s fantasy. Actually writing is something he does when no one else is around." to some degree structural. A profile writer especially in the company of another writer is a false friend who dreams of being a secret sharer. Lipsky��s assignment is to pry distort and betray to use Wallace��s words and the details of his existence as material for his own dubious project. Wallace knows this and acquiesces to it ��� ���you agreed to the interview�� is Lipsky��s fallback when his subject gets prickly ��� and generally handles himself with grace and forbearance." �� David Foster Wallace observed in The New York Times Book Review in 2004 in reference to ���Borges: A Life.�� Readers who pick up such books drawn by their admiration for a writer��s work are likely to find themselves distracted and disappointed by a welter of iffy theories and picayune data. In the case of Borges Wallace argued ���the stories so completely transcend their motive cause that the biographical facts become in the deepest and most literal way irrelevant.��" whether it captures the true Wallace or not is sharp and sensitive in no small part because it��s modest and appropriately evasive. The essential David Wallace is precisely what the film reminds us we can��t see even as David Lipsky wants desperately to track him down and display him to the readers of Rolling Stone. Wallace is caught in a familiar set of contradictions. He wants attention but craves solitude. He��s willing to collaborate with the machinery of publicity even as he worries about the phoniness of it all. He��s ambitious and eager to protect himself from the consequences of his ambition. In short he��s a famous writer." whose earlier features include ���The Spectacular Now�� and ���Smashed �� would much rather observe two people in aimless conversation than usher them through the tollbooths of narrative convention. And conversation including the uncomfortable silences that punctuate it is pretty much the entire substance of ���The End of the Tour.�� Yes there��s a fair amount of smoking and junk-food eating an excursion to the Mall of America and a multiplex showing of ���Broken Arrow�� (with John Travolta taking a missile to the gut) but Mr. Ponsoldt and the screenwriter the playwright Donald Margulies allow words to speak louder than actions." for his short-term companion both alpha dog and prey an object of envy as well as admiration a meal ticket and an imaginary friend. The film poses the question ���Who is the real David Foster Wallace?�� as a feint. He is its premise its axiom its great white whale. The more relevant question the moral problem on which the movie turns is ���who is David Lipsky?��" and for that matter of just about any author worth reading. The work is everything; the life is trivia. And since I��m about to praise a movie about David Foster Wallace that claims fidelity to at least some of the facts of his life I should perhaps identify myself as a devoted nonconsumer of literary biographies an avowed biopic skeptic and unless someone offers me a lot of money to write one a habitual avoider of celebrity profiles. So by all rights I should hate ���The End of the Tour �� James Ponsoldt��s new film a portrait of the writer that has its origins in a (never-published) magazine profile. In fact I love it."

how might his precocious gift be nurtured and protected? These are on the surface among the main questions posed by ���The Kindergarten Teacher �� a self-assured remarkably powerful film from the Israeli writer-director Nadav Lapid." a woman with a warm professional manner and pleasant ordinary middle-class life. She has a son in the army a daughter in high school and a devoted husband (Lior Raz) with a decent government job. As a hobby ��� or perhaps as a vehicle for unexpressed ambitions and frustrated desires ��� she attends a poetry workshop with other amateur versifiers. Then one day she witnesses a startling act of creation. One of her pupils a cherubic sleepy-eyed boy named Yoav (Avi Shnaidman) is being picked up at the end of the school day. ���I have a poem �� he announces and recites a brief elliptical love lyric pacing back and forth as his nanny writes his words in a notebook." which tracks the parallel stories of a group of left-wing Jewish militants and an elite police unit Mr. Lapid explored the alienation and class conflict that fester beneath the prosperous surface of contemporary Israeli society. ���The Kindergarten Teacher�� is a furious indictment of the materialism and complacency of 21st-century life in Israel and implicitly beyond. Yoav innocent and barely conscious of the meaning of his poems is the uncanny voice of a disinherited tradition. His father a flashy restaurateur has no use for poetry. The boy��s uncle who published a volume of verses before drifting into bitterness and penury as a journalist is a grim specter of literary failure. Such poets as exist in the world ��� the shouters at the reading Nira��s workshop instructor ��� run the gamut from vulgar to pretentious." but the film��s internal experts Nira included are impressed enough with their linguistic polish and thematic sophistication to elevate them above mere verbal child��s play. Nira introduces her prot�g� to the work of his precursors including the Israeli ���national poet�� Chaim Nachman Bialik. She is concerned with the progress of Yoav��s ���career �� a strange notion given his age." Mr. Lapid keeps Nira on the near side of normalcy. ���The Kindergarten Teacher�� works perfectly well as a subtle astute psychological drama venturing into thriller territory toward the end. The director and his cinematographer Shai Goldman favor shallow-focus compositions and low odd angles. At times you feel like a child observing the grown-up world peering up at legs and hands trying to decode the meaning of gestures and words. At other times as the camera tiptoes around conversations and peeks over shoulders you feel like a spy or a voyeur privy to vaguely inappropriate information." and the evolution of her interest in Yoav drives the film��s suspenseful unnerving bizarre and strangely believable plot. At first like any conscientious teacher she is solicitous and encouraging. It��s always good to recognize and celebrate what is special in a child. The budding bard is in most respects a perfectly ordinary child roughhousing and practicing swear words with his best pal playing in the sandbox and demanding snacks when he��s hungry. It��s possible to read signs of unusual intelligence in his expressions but his most prominent feature is a face that seems created to invite a grandmother��s pinches." and correct in her increasingly despairing assessment of his environment. Like many Israeli filmmakers Mr. Lapid uses cinema as a vehicle for social criticism but both the intensity and the orientation of his critique set him apart from his peers. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict an unavoidable and in some respects easy subject for liberal-minded artists and writers is largely absent from ���The Kindergarten Teacher �� as it was from his previous feature ���Policeman.��" �� Nira says and the most surprising ��� the most radical ��� aspect of ���The Kindergarten Teacher�� is how fiercely it defends that view. Yoav may be in the eyes of a reasonable viewer an odd kid with an unusual knack for language. Nira for her part may be a frustrated poet sliding from midlife crisis into mental instability. Certainly there is no condoning the extremes to which she takes her pedagogical mission." a 20-year veteran of the kindergarten classroom is immune to his cuteness. He acts serious in her company because that��s what she expects and also perhaps because he��s a little confused by her attention. She wakes him up from his nap and takes him outside in the rain hoping to stimulate his creativity. She takes over from the nanny as his principal secretary and spends more and more time with him outside school. She signs him up for a poetry reading. And then things become really strange." for intensity beauty and meaning. Its sobering lesson is that the search for those things is most likely to end in madness confusion and violence."

don��t try this at home." another plus. For most of his action-movie career he has come across as a less romantically nimble less self-amused version of Douglas Fairbanks the swashbuckler who leaped through the silent era. Like Mr. Cruise Fairbanks performed many of his own white-knuckle stunts as when he climbs up the chain of a closing drawbridge in ���Robin Hood.�� (Fairbanks helped start United Artists which Mr. Cruise owned a piece of for a while.) All too often Mr. Cruise��s insistence on doing frightening stunts in the ���Mission: Impossible�� series has become its most distinguishing quality. In this movie though when he goes airborne like a barnstormer the scene��s self-conscious sense of the absurd suggests he��s trying to let his inner Harold Lloyd out to play." and Ethan struggles to keep his cool ��� a single drop of sweat splashed on the floor would blow the operation ��� the visual gloss and high-tech gobbledygook Mr. Cruise��s graceful athleticism and Mr. De Palma��s New Hollywood suspense chops flow together turning the scene into the emblematic ���Mission: Impossible�� showstopper. It��s the kind of pure cine-spectacle that jolts you before sweeping you up. There��s never been a scene in the series as memorable as that one even if the exploding fish tank the film��s other eye-popper comes close. These sequences set a high bar both for directors who followed in Mr. De Palma��s wake and for Mr. Cruise��s physical performance which in the later installments has largely involved progressively scarier stunts." who��s been tethered to Mr. Cruise for the past decade. They worked together on Mr. McQuarrie��s adaptation of ���Jack Reacher �� a grim genre bummer that was a bad fit for Mr. Cruise who can rarely go tough and dark with conviction. Mr. McQuarrie also had a hand in writing ���Edge of Tomorrow �� Doug Liman��s underloved science-fiction romp that dovetailed with Mr. Cruise��s strengths including a too infrequently tapped gift for light comedy. Mr. McQuarrie who made his name with his rebuslike script for ���The Usual Suspects �� tends to work the more lugubrious end of the entertainment spectrum so it��s a nice surprise that ���Rogue Nation�� isn��t just another clenched-jaw blowout." �� which slows down when the plot tangles or some ceremonial manly peacocking ensues usually from Mr. Renner and Mr. Cruise. Clearly Mr. McQuarrie and his star feel the need to stamp the series with seriousness something that Mr. De Palma knew better than to do. And throughout ���Rogue Nation �� you can sense the filmmakers comfortably at times awkwardly playing tug of war with the mood which grows sinister with the excellent Sean Harris as the regulation evil genius and almost frisky with Alec Baldwin as an intelligence blowhard and Tom Hollander as a political boob. Mr. Pegg��s second-banana flair is especially crucial here because it helps show that Mr. Cruise whose smile at times seems awfully strained these days can still take a ribbing as well as a licking." specific and generic ���Rogue Nation�� is pretty much like most of the ���Impossible�� movies in that it��s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie after tinkering and oiling has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns global trotting and gadgets a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star. Jeremy Renner Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg (with his valuable comic timing) are all back joined by the series newcomer Rebecca Ferguson. She plays a super-vixen the amusingly named Ilsa Faust who enters with the camera peeking up her skirt and rises like a half-shell Venus �� la the original Bond Girl Ursula Andress. Even so Ms. Ferguson has more going for her than man-throttling thighs (and an ace stunt double Lucy Cork); she holds her own both on the ground and in midair." a spinoff from the 1960s television show was released 19 years ago and was though it��s almost hard to believe it now something of an auteurist event having been directed by Brian De Palma. Mr. Cruise was an established action star by 1996 but he also helped produce the first film which strengthened his status as an international brand. As a star-auteur he has always been the most important feature and effect of the series although it��s telling that Mr. De Palma oversaw the set-piece that gave the movies their foundational image: Mr. Cruise��s operative Ethan Hunt hovering like a spider (or a puppet) above a luminous white floor while suspended by a very thin rope." �� taking one blow after another you can��t help worrying that he won��t be able to keep this action stuff up. It looks so hard! But here he is the 53-year-old Tom Terrific holding onto a plane as it takes off defying sense and gravity and making you wonder (not for the first time) if he would actually die for our pleasure.

But more interesting testimonials to use fan parlance come from AFOLs (Adult Fans of Lego) in LUGs (Lego User Groups) who assemble in the movie at conventions in Seattle and Chicago. We meet Adam Reed Tucker an architect building miniature Lego skyscrapers; David Pagano a New York filmmaker specializing in Lego stop-motion animation (���brickfilms��); and Nathan Sawaya an artist whose show ���The Art of the Brick�� comes to Times Square in the course of filming." and it is certainly that ��� to an extent. (Lego did not finance the film.) And this nimble expertly paced family-friendly film by Daniel Junge and Kief Davidson dutifully covers the origins of the Lego company in Billund Denmark and its growth into a global toy brand rivaling Mattel and Hasbro. But it delves into other things: how engineers and psychologists have employed the pieces as tools and the ways in which people have adopted Legos as a medium to realize their creative visions."

but he��s using visual and aural fragments ��� think of them as story shards ��� instead of three distinct acts and character arcs. Sometimes the meanings of these fragments unfold clearly; sometimes you need to piece the fragments together as you would a jigsaw puzzle. Not every chapter has a particularly strong story; in the untitled Chapter 3 Mr. Cohen cuts from an opening shot of yellow autumnal leaves to a figure in an apartment and then to a close-up of a woman��s face bathed in warm light. You may guess that the light is pouring from the same window that will soon be blocked by a condo and you��d be right." �� Mr. Cohen draws upon other influences as well evoking place films like Walter Ruttmann��s 1927 classic ���Berlin: Symphony of a Great City�� and nodding at narratives like Virgil��s ���The Aeneid.�� ���Counting�� is another type of travel story one in which the world is often framed in the window of a moving car train or plane. That��s because among all the many stories that Mr. Cohen tells the most personal one is that of an itinerant persistently independent filmmaker who continues to practice his art and follow his path with the support of far-flung festivals and art foundations several of which are listed in the credits. From Portugal to Turkey Mr. Cohen has been gazing out at worlds and people on the long winding road that leads every artist back home." �� a wistful meditation on the world its beauties mysteries and injustices the independent filmmaker Jem Cohen cuts from a photograph of Soviet cosmonauts to a view out a plane window. There are a number of aerial images scattered throughout the movie which Mr. Cohen has stitched together from visual fragments that he shot over a period that took him from Coney Island to Moscow. Mr. Cohen born in 1962 turns out to be another type of space-age traveler if one who��s specifically crossing cinematic time." by turns organized and more diffuse is a leitmotif in ���Counting �� though it��s easy to see the entire movie ��� with its insistence on ordinary beauty and its undertow of leftist politics ��� as an act of resistance. For the most part Mr. Cohen��s protest is quietly expressed although it gathers force with the repetition of certain visuals notably with the images of building construction and seemingly uprooted men and women. Over the course of the movie the references to gentrification commercialization urban overbuilding and the lack of affordable housing dovetail with Mr. Cohen��s own marginalized status as a New York artist working outside the cinematic commercial mainstream who as you see is watching a condo go up right outside his window." �� Mr. Cohen inserts a shot of a Japanese good luck cat an early overt acknowledgment of the debt that he owes the French filmmaker Chris Marker who died in 2012. Good luck cats populate Mr. Marker��s essay film ���Sans Soleil �� an exploration of time place and memory. At one point the narrator of ���Sans Soleil�� says (memorably!): ���I��m writing you all this from another world a world of appearances. In a way the two worlds communicate with each other. Memory is to one what history is to the other: an impossibility.�� As Mr. Cohen shifts from one space and time to the next in ���Counting �� the filmmaker ��� who has long been ���writing�� from the world of appearances with his camera ��� expresses the melancholy and longing embedded in that impossibility." �� and gives it a formal logic as the title suggests. The movie is divided into 15 numbered chapters most of which open with titles (���A Day Is Long �� ���There and Back��) and end with time-and-place setting text. In Chapter 6 which is bookended by the words ���The Blues�� and ���New York City 2012-2014 �� Mr. Cohen juxtaposes rainy street shots with those of homeless people the words ���Trump is a monster�� etched on a sidewalk and a man and woman ��� he��s playing a guitar she��s wearing a sign ���Disarm the Pentagon�� ��� next to the statue of another dissenter George Washington on the steps of the Federal Hall National Memorial."

as the summer political-convention season approached ABC News decided to take a gamble. The network seemed permanently stuck in third place and its news division in particular suffered from the lack of a brand-name on-air authority figure to compete with Chet Huntley and David Brinkley at NBC or Walter Cronkite at CBS. Back in those days the two leading networks covered the conventions live from beginning to end. (Can you imagine?) Instead of comprehensiveness ABC went for provocation and at least the illusion of intellectual heft hiring Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley Jr. to conduct a series of debates during the Republican circus in Miami and the subsequent Democratic debacle in Chicago. ���Best of Enemies �� Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville��s lively new documentary an accessible assemblage of archival footage and talking-head analysis mines the Buckley-Vidal skirmishes for nuggets of historical insight." although capturing the full range of their complexities in particular as literary figures lies beyond its modest compact scope. It��s too bad that both Buckley and Vidal died before this film was made ��� not that they would have necessarily participated ��� but Mr. Neville and Mr. Gordon make up for this absence by using Kelsey Grammer to read Buckley��s words about Vidal and John Lithgow to read Vidal��s reflections on Buckley." and the journalists biographers colleagues and kin invited on camera to fill out the story have been judiciously chosen. A few are current or former employees of The New York Times including Sam Tanenhaus a former editor of The Times Book Review and Buckley��s authorized biographer." excavating a biographical Before and adumbrating a news media After. The smeary hot hues of old video ��� the ��68 conventions were the first to be broadcast in color ��� add both immediacy and distance. Some protocols and artifacts of network television look quaint: the antenna-bedecked headsets of correspondents on the floor; the scripted prose of their reports. And the two antagonists with their upper-crust accents and their compulsive displays of erudition are not the kind of guys you see much on the tube these days or anywhere else for that matter." as television journalism transformed itself from democracy��s buttoned-up superego into its snarling id. The arguments about sex war race and culture have hardly quieted since 1968. Buckley and Vidal may rest in peace but the rest of us have stayed plastered." you-know-it-when-you-see-it phenomenon called ���great television.�� The most memorable such moment occurred late in the battle as the Chicago Police Department rampaged in Grant Park. What looked like law and order to Mayor Richard J. Daley and like ���Gestapo tactics�� to Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff of Connecticut set off a series of especially nasty personal volleys between ABC��s designated intellectuals. Vidal needled Buckley calling him a ���crypto-Nazi�� until Buckley lost his patrician cool and snapped back: ���Now listen you queer. Stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I��ll sock you in your goddamn face and you��ll stay plastered.�� Ratings gold." founder and editor of National Review host of ���Firing Line�� and a champion of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan was a leading strategist and theoretician of the rising right. Vidal while temperamentally not a joiner or a leader of movements was at the time stationed at the respectable left wing of American liberalism a critic of the nation��s foreign policy and an evangelist for cultural and sexual freedom. His best-selling novel ���Myra Breckinridge �� a blithe and naughty satire of modern hypocrisy with a gender-fluid heroine (played on screen by Raquel Welch) can be said to represent nearly everything Buckley loathed and feared about the ��60s." war sexual revolution and a threatened punch in the face." not always successfully. Part of the occult power of television lies in its ability to collapse the distance between the trivial and the consequential. Vidal and Buckley were authentically important and interesting writers and thinkers but sitting under the lights they were above all celebrities signifiers of their own distorted individuality. The film provides little evidence that over the course of the 10 debates they said anything of real substance even as the fabric of the Republic was unraveling and being rewoven before their eyes. To understand their thoughts on what was unfolding around them you will have to consult their writings. Meanwhile the spectacle of what Mr. Tanenhaus calls ���intellectual debate as blood sport�� provides a visceral slightly vulgar thrill." at once bona fide intellectuals true-blue aristocrats and knowing caricatures of those very types. Each one had earlier in the decade run a losing campaign for elective office in New York State: Vidal earnestly sought a congressional seat in the Hudson Valley in 1960; Buckley staged a lively protest candidacy in the New York City mayoral election of 1965. They were scions of powerful privileged families prep school graduates (Vidal never went to college) military veterans and tirelessly entrepreneurial men of letters happy to dabble in mass media when it suited their needs. They also genuinely and sincerely hated each other��s guts." not entirely satisfying answer is ���both.�� The Buckley-Vidal dust-ups are seen as a pinnacle of high-mindedness from which we have long since descended and also as the beginning of a slide from civility into endless belligerence."

Rusty after procuring a ridiculous Albanian rental car that steals a few scenes of its own makes one mistake after another as he blunders toward Walley World with his reluctant family.

but then it seems impossible to cram an existence as fully lived as Brando��s ��� which reaches from his Nebraska childhood to California New York Tahiti and beyond ��� into a few hours. That said you get a sense of that life because for a celebrity who became known as a recluse in his later years Brando played the public relations game for a very long time as the many interview clips show. Some of these are available online including a 1955 ���Person to Person�� profile by Edward R. Murrow which was shot soon after Brando won his first Oscar for ���On the Waterfront.�� It��s a thoughtful interview as far as these things go and Brando plays along nicely even when his abusive father Marlon Sr. whom he loathed bigfoots into view." largely through snippets of audio recordings that he made over decades. Although it opens with a bit of text about the recordings it doesn��t explain how the British director Stevan Riley and his collaborators got their hands on them. The press notes state that the recordings were ���uniquely gifted�� to the production company for the movie; a recent article in The Los Angeles Times suggests a more commercially expedient reason: The actor��s estate Brando Enterprises ���decided it was time�� for a flick to introduce him to a new generation." Mr. Riley��s shaping of Brando��s words can make the movie every so often difficult to fully embrace. Mr. Riley��s handling of the fatal 1990 shooting of Dag Drollet by Christian Brando Brando��s son is especially unfortunate and the use of some tabloidlike news material sleazes up the movie a touch. (Mr. Drollet was the boyfriend of Brando��s daughter Cheyenne.) Mr. Riley��s use of a disembodied floating Brando head created from digital scans that the actor made in the 1980s is initially amusing but it��s a needless distraction as are the cutaways to murkily lit messily appointed rooms that are actually re-creations of those in his Mulholland Drive mansion." the movie gives you the opportunity for its loquacious title subject to pour his thoughts into your ears for some 100 babbling minutes. This was a cat who could rap as his longtime friend and former roommate James Baldwin might have said. The movie is stuffed with boldface names like Baldwin who (with his pal Norman Mailer) first encountered Brando in Greenwich Village in the mid-1940s. ���I had never met any white man like Marlon �� Baldwin later said. ���He was obviously immensely talented ��� a real creative force ��� and totally unconventional and independent a beautiful cat.�� Baldwin said that Brando was ���contemptuous of anyone who discriminated in any way �� adding that the actor a professional seducer made him feel that ���reports I was ugly had been much exaggerated.��" and neither does this movie. As his admirer James Dean probably knew all too well Brando was a true rebel partly because he thought being a star was absurd and partly because as clip after clip shows he always had a cause whether it was civil rights black power Native American sovereignty or his own independence. At its most satisfying ���Listen to Me Marlon�� brings you close to a man whose legacy seems to have been tarnished less by his widely reported (and misreported) actions than by an entertainment press that punishes those who refuse to play the game. Brando found the game ludicrous. But he played along until he didn��t and while he occasionally suffered the consequences along with too many fools his work outlasts it all." more than a few obituary writers decided he hadn��t been a contender after all. For them this brilliant actor had devolved into as much a loser as Terry Malloy his punch-drunk boxer in ���On the Waterfront �� who is sold down the river and with a face battered by fights and the pain of a brother��s betrayal famously eulogizes himself: ���I coulda been a contender I coulda been somebody instead of a bum which is what I am.�� Those who dismissed Brando reviewed his life as if it were some kind of movie one with a strong opening act a bewildering middle and a disappointing conclusion deserving of a collective thumbs down."

The puzzle-box narrative only grows more hypnotic with repeat viewings. The movie insists on having the audience like Ventura pass through madness to reach catharsis." the dialogue doesn��t match the visuals." it is an old-fashioned Freudian loony-bin tale in which a hero grapples with repressed guilt. As the film opens Ventura descends into what appears to be a dungeon only to wind up in a hospital where he is greeted by comrades from his past. These (likely) phantoms include Vitalina a Cape Verdean who has traveled to Portugal for the funeral of her husband a man who Ventura says is still alive.

Quietly charismatic able to flicker from steeliness to desperation with an eye movement or a hand gesture Ms. Hoss embodies Mr. Petzold��s fluctuating idea of postwar Germany itself: vain guilty vulnerable confused." a victim and survivor of her country��s worst era suffers from an especially acute form of confusion. She is desperate to find Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld) even though ��� as we and Lene discover before Nelly does ��� he divorced her during the war and denounced her to the Gestapo. When she does run into him he insists on being called Johannes and doesn��t recognize her thanks to the plastic surgery and also perhaps to his own guilty conscience." coolly intelligent and flawlessly paced ���Phoenix�� often feels trapped in the logic of its conceit. Neither the full horror nor the absurdity of Nelly��s situation registers partly because the self-conscious genre touches keep her story at a distance. Mr. Petzold has made a suave and suspenseful entertainment that doesn��t seem entirely sure that it wants to be ��� or is able to be ��� more. It comes closest at the very end in a final scene that infuses an old popular song with the full weight of cruelty betrayal and hope." who calls herself Eva in his presence is a close enough match to impersonate his dead former wife. He is eager to get his hands on her estate which is being held by Allied authorities and he rehearses Eva in an elaborate and dismaying ruse. They will stage a reunion for the benefit of their old friends collect the cash split it and go their separate ways. It��s hardly the worst or the strangest scam to be contemplated in the chaos of a defeated occupied city. Nelly agrees to Johnny��s plan and it��s hard to tell whether she is passively going along with it out of love longing and denial or pursuing a hidden agenda of her own."

Q isn��t one of literature��s young rebels riding the Mississippi like Huckleberry Finn or denouncing phonies �� la Holden Caulfield. Q��s parents are nice his friends are nice he��s nice. The only significant character who isn��t immediately ���relatable�� (a noxious industry mantra and the most damaging word in American cinema) is Margo a prickly complex object of desire who rejects the world that Q embraces. ���I do believe in college �� he quietly assures himself after Margo goes on a mild anti-establishment harangue. Here most young people don��t howl; they scarcely bleat." unsurprising hero with a bit of charm. A practiced scene-stealer having swiveled heads in earlier films including ���The Fault in Our Stars �� Mr. Wolff is appealing in ���Paper Towns.�� But his performance is far too self-confident and knowing at times almost slick for a teenage character whose questioning nature and narrative purpose is inscribed in his single-letter nickname. He comes off exactly like the Hollywood up-and-comer he is and is finally as out of place in this world as Ms. Delevingne is. She��s nice on the eyes no doubt but she doesn��t have the tools to take this underwritten screen role and make it hurt and you spend a lot of time watching her Groucho brows hold steady over her sunburst smiles." but what happens when the kids are pretty much all right? Not a whole lot at least in ���Paper Towns �� a serenely bland adaptation of the John Green young-adult novel about a regular boy in love with the mystery girl next door. Once upon a Hollywood time when American adolescents were in the grip of social mores and studio censorship nice guys wooed nice gals with boyish smiles well-behaved hands and tamped-down desires. What��s old is new again in ���Paper Towns �� a melodrama in which smiles still tremble hands largely behave and freedom��s just another word for everything an ordinary boy doesn��t want to lose." who also adapted Mr. Green��s ���The Fault in Our Stars �� ���Paper Towns�� tracks Q as he sets off on one of those classically entwined excursions that take him out into the world and inside his being. It��s a passage that starts in childhood when Margo and Q find a dead body (she creeps toward it while he recoils) and lurches forward in adolescence after Margo vanishes leaving what look like clues in her wake. Seeing Margo as an idea and ideal (and himself as a savior) Q seizes on the clues ��� scattered in books of poetry and in more prosaic locations ��� in a search of a woman who leads him straight to as is often the case himself." what makes Q such a deceptively tricky literary creation ��� his averageness ��� is the very thing the filmmakers struggle with partly because movies of this commercial scale and bottom-line ambition rarely know what to do with ordinary life. So they pump it up. That struggle is evident in the wall-to-wall pop songs that make it seem as if someone hired a D.J. to get the party going and in particular in the almost tic-like overuse of slow motion a stylistic clich� that intentionally or not suggests Q has already begun packaging these moments of modest excitement into memories as they happen. And why not? This is after all a story about a boy who idealizes a girl he barely knows and for a brief time chases after in his family��s minivan. Even the choice of car speaks volumes: Q was born to be mild and knows it." Q for short who opens up the story by explaining that he thinks everyone gets a miracle. In his case that would be Margo Roth Spiegelman (the model Cara Delevingne) one of those women ��� guide muse or free spirit she comes in flavors as varied as Pocahontas Zelda and Tinker Bell ��� who aid men on their journeys metaphysical and literal. Q and Margo meet when they��re children and while she doesn��t seem all that impressed he��s smitten. Years later after they��ve grown apart and are on the verge of graduating from high school Q remains under Margo��s spell and she��s actually noticed him again."

We first encounter him defending his title with a late-round knockout at Madison Square Garden which an announcer notes is a few blocks (and also ���a million miles��) from the Hell��s Kitchen orphanage where the champ grew up.

But it��s strictly an undercard bout displaying enough heart and skill to keep the paying customers from getting too restless." flattened and foreshortened. Common sense is knocked silly. But Mr. Fuqua has never been a director to let ridiculousness get in the way of visceral action.

Abandoned by his manager (Curtis Jackson better known as 50 Cent) Billy sets out to take back what he can. He walks into a scruffy New York gym and finds a battered philosophical trainer named Willis with the melancholy mien of Forest Whitaker." but boxing movies tend to value impact over finesse. Few genres are so reliably and bluntly conventional. Primal stories ��� rise and fall ruin and redemption the love of a good woman ��� are punctuated by scenes of carefully choreographed pugilism. Violence and sentimentality dance in the ring and the audience leaves satisfied if not exactly surprised." which is of course not the same as a movie about the reality of the sport (despite participation by the former multiweight champion Roy Jones Jr. who plays himself). Even biopics about practitioners of the sweet science (���Raging Bull�� partly excepted) have a habit of preferring formula to verisimilitude but while ���Southpaw�� sings a familiar tune it features some pretty appealing players.

which give the movie a fuzzy focal point namely that she needs to believe she��s worthy of a man��s love or something. The movie suggests that this has to do with her adored father Gordon (Colin Quinn) who��s introduced in the opener delivering uncommon words of advice to the 9-year-old Amy and her younger sister Kim. ���Monogamy isn��t realistic �� Gordon declares instructing his daughters to repeat after him. Fast forward 23 years and Amy has done just that seemingly taking those words to heart by freely taking men to bed. She��s breezily accepting of her choices though falters when she receives a one-two punch: She falls for a monogamous-minded surgeon Aaron (Bill Hader sweetly vulnerable) and her father��s bad health dramatically worsens." if not like those who generally flounder through the average dippy romantic comedy where gender norms are rigorously enforced and the only things contemporary about the characters are their designer threads and gadgets. What��s energizing and exciting about Amy especially when compared with the sexless cuties populating rom-coms in which female pleasure is often expressed through shopping is that her erotic appetites aren��t problems that she needs to narratively solve and vanquish. She likes sex thanks as an early montage of her shuffling through various men nicely illustrates." as in a brutally funny short scene tucked in a montage sequence in which Amy and Aaron have sex on a bench in front of a bridge. Much like the flourish from George Gershwin��s ���Rhapsody in Blue�� that slips onto the ���Trainwreck�� soundtrack this image initially sneaks in like yet another homage to Woody Allen��s 1979 film ���Manhattan �� and the most famous image in his work. The allusion quickly turns into an evisceration of that movie��s gauzy romanticism when Amy jokes that she thinks this is where ���Woody Allen met Soon-Yi.�� It sounds cheap only if you forget that the other romantic couple in ���Manhattan �� the one not immortalized on the bridge was played by Mr. Allen and a teenage Mariel Hemingway." which sputters when the story takes a short awkwardly managed detour into tragedy. Ms. Schumer trained as an actress and her tears in ���Trainwreck�� are fairly persuasive if not as contagious as her laughs. Yet while they��re narrative necessities they��re also tonally at odds with the movie��s overall buoyancy. (Mr. Apatow��s sentimental side is crystallized by a close-up of a weeping Amy a shot that underscores the obvious.) As with a lot of debuts there are a few different stories crammed into ���Trainwreck �� which is Ms. Schumer��s first produced film script and the least satisfying one is the melodrama about the daughter struggling to come to terms with her feelings for an aggressively unlovable father who begot bred and loved her." which she turned into something of a sexual bildungsroman cum romantic comedy jumping with pop-cultural references and edged with razored social cultural critique. Her on-screen doppelg�_nger works as a writer for a men��s magazine S��Nuff a blistering jokey title that sums up the idiocy of lad mags and their annihilating views on women. That the editor running it is a woman Dianna (a peerless Tilda Swinton in a swingy shag and gloomy spray tan) isn��t surprising. Ms. Schumer can be a merciless equal-opportunity takedown artist. If she doesn��t let women off the hook it��s because she knows that sexism isn��t exclusively a guy thing; like stupidity it is a people thing." �� Ms. Schumer plays well Amy a more vanilla version of one of her comically flawed women who aren��t as remotely together as they think or may appear to be. The movie which was directed by Judd Apatow from her script is often extremely funny even if it never approaches the radicalness of her greatest most dangerous work. Mr. Apatow��s talent as a movie director is opening up a space on screen in which comic performers (and some total stiffs) can be effortlessly funny together. In ���Trainwreck �� he creates a roomy comfortable vehicle stuffed with second bananas (both professional zanies and guest-starring squares) who support Ms. Schumer as she tosses out jokes pops her eyes deploys her deadpan and shows off her gift for old-school physical high jinks often in heels and minis." as she does repeatedly. That could be seen as having your cake and eating it too but mostly it adds another ding to an often ridiculous imperfect recognizable character. (This is after all a woman who when she cuts back on her drinking donates her booze to a derelict played by Dave Attell.) At times in some of her bits Ms. Schumer has like other comics used fakey apologies as get-out-of- jail cards as a way to both toss out insults and smilingly refuse responsibility for them. In ���Trainwreck �� as in her best work elsewhere Ms. Schumer is at her strongest when she insists that women aren��t distressed damsels but ��� as they toddle walk and race in the highest of heels the tightest of skirts the sexiest mightiest of poses ��� the absolute agents of their lives and desires." preferring to go with the story flow and use the passage from swinging singleton to cuddling coupledom to cover the joke spectrum from the comedy of erections to the trouble with spooning. The postcoital nuzzling bit echoes some laughs that the standup comic Elayne Boosler generated about men women and intimacy (���I think you should make love and go to your corners��) in her landmark self-financed 1985 comedy special ���Party of One.�� A pioneering figure in the 1970s New York standup scene Ms. Boosler is one of those female pop-cultural warriors (like Clara Bow Mae West Beyonc� etc.) who insist on claiming their sexuality as you know their own." who in recent years has worked with the likes of Kristen Wiig and Lena Dunham continue to put his show-business power to good by joining forces with a smart woman. For too long the bromances (a subgenre that he popularized) and its corollary the wedding comedy have segregated heterosexual men and women into seemingly irreconcilable camps. After ���Bridesmaids�� blew up my colleague A. O. Scott astutely suggested that perhaps what it revealed wasn��t that women can be funny but that as he wrote ���men and women can��t be funny at the same time or direct their humor at one another.�� Similarly to Ms. Dunham who in her show ���Girls�� brilliantly grapples with what heterosexual romance means today Ms. Schumer may be helping change that dynamic." ���Inside Amy Schumer �� know there��s almost nothing that anyone can say about women her included that she hasn��t already said herself. Her powers of deflection are the perfect approach in a neofeminist moment in which women are calling out sexists sometimes against vicious pushback. Think that she��s not thin enough or pretty enough? She intercepts hateful slurs like those and turns them into ferocious comedy gold that exposes chauvinism as the absurdity it is. She can��t be stereotyped away as a sourpuss who just needs to chill out lie back and smile. She��s already smiling and she��s killing it joke after joke." she has a way to go including as a screenwriter. ���Trainwreck�� has groaners and dead spots (including a dreary art-film parody with Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei) and its jokes about race don��t have the penetrating wit that her material on sex and gender does. Like a lot of white people Ms. Schumer can fumble when latching onto race; unlike a lot of white performers she takes on race directly. The looming appearance of LeBron James who plays himself as well as Aaron��s odd-couple-like best friend may be a heat-seeking gimmick (he��s the movie��s biggest star) but he��s a surprisingly limber comic presence and he helps set up a sharp scene in which Aaron challenges Amy��s bumblingly false claim about having black friends."

Mr. Allen plays this notion for some weak laughs; better is the powerful close-up of Abe��s face after the crime ��� his unfocused eyes staring ahead and ringed in violent red ��� that suggests the frenzied madness of the void. It��s startling and unsettling for what it conveys about Abe and because unlike in ���Crimes and Misdemeanors �� in which a rabbi responds to another void by plaintively invoking a ���moral structure �� there��s no real argument being advanced here." locations costumes and so forth even as the preoccupations remain much the same. In ���Irrational Man �� the usual resident Allen philosopher is an actual philosopher Abe Lucas a newly arrived East Coast college professor whom Joaquin Phoenix makes equal parts attraction and repulsion. A soulful presence Mr. Phoenix excels at playing characters who often struggle to express themselves one tormented or comically inarticulate word at a time. Here though consistently watchable he often seems ready to flee the scene perhaps because his character is so uneasy or because Mr. Allen hasn��t given Mr. Phoenix enough material to turn Abe into a thinker who can persuasively cite Heidegger." on-screen and off that life is meaningless which may be true even if he seems feverishly bent on refuting it with his prodigious cinematic output. If you��ve seen any of that yield you have seen a version of ���Irrational Man.�� As tends to be the case with his work this new light and dark film looks sounds and plays a lot like some of his previous titles. That isn��t a dig. One of the givens of Mr. Allen��s screen work and sometimes its attractions is how each new film registers as another chapter in a project that in its scale and scope and in the way in which it seems to speak to his personal life has come to resemble a weird metafiction. In his short story ���The Book of Sand �� Jorge Luis Borges creates ���an infinite book�� without beginning or end which is another way of describing how it can feel when considering the entirety of Mr. Allen��s films." �� a writer and a physicist walk into a room (well really they��re playing pool) when the writer asks the physicist ���Is there anything more terrifying than the destruction of the world?�� The physicist sunk deep in gloomy shadow answers ���Yeah the knowledge that it doesn��t matter one way or the other ��� that it��s all random radiating aimlessly out of nothing and eventually vanishing forever.�� The physicist says that he��s not talking about the world. ���I��m talking about the universe �� adding ���all space all time just a temporary convulsion.��" or answer to Abe who in putting (distorting) some of his philosophical beliefs to criminal ends evokes Leopold and Loeb 1920s ���thrill killers�� who misread Nietzsche. The horror of where rationalism can lead (the death camps for one) hangs over ���Irrational Man�� and helps hold you as does Mr. Phoenix even with some bad writing and Mr. Allen��s narrative laxity and lack of interest in how real people live. At one point he includes a fairground scene perhaps to evoke Alfred Hitchcock��s ���Strangers on a Train�� and its mad murderous theorist. It makes for a nice shiver by proxy in a film that goes dark without going deep and keeps you wondering just how personal the title ���Irrational Man�� is or if it��s more of an existential shrug."

Early in the film two elderly men stroll down an overgrown path to the banks of the Snake River gleefully demonstrating how they beat their captives dragged them by the feet and then hacked them to death with knives and machetes. Their laughter is all the more horrifying for seeming free and un-self-conscious as if they were recalling incidents of youthful mischief." the boasting and the superstition there are some of the expected evasions and excuses.

Like its companion film ���The Act of Killing �� released in 2013 it examines the mass killings that began in Indonesia in 1965 when at least a million people were slaughtered in the aftermath of a military coup." what forgiveness?�� T. S. Eliot asked that question in his poem ���Gerontion �� almost a century ago and it has hovered over much subsequent history. Mr. Oppenheimer and his collaborators pose it with renewed urgency and poignancy and also suggest the ways that in Indonesia forgiveness is still premature. The silence they discover is not a failure of acknowledgment but the refusal of apology." perpetrators of the massacres eagerly re-enact their crimes borrowing costumes and attitudes from American genre movies as if they were western or film noir heroes. In ���The Look of Silence �� it is clear that many of the killers whose political sponsors are still in power feel little or no regret for their actions. On the contrary they bask in a glow of righteous vindication. A death squad commander matter-of-factly talks about ���exterminating Communists�� for several months and concludes that ���because this was an international matter we should be given a gift. We should be rewarded with a trip to America.�� Recalling the Cold War context of the atrocities he notes that ���America taught us to hate Communists.��" while politicians insist that the slaughter was the spontaneous expression of popular will. It��s suggested at one point that the ���Communists�� offered themselves up asking to be killed as punishment for their transgressions." for the most part unnervingly calm and decorous.

Tight friends Sin-Dee and Alexandra share much in common including a taste for sweets a weakness for men and absolute faith in the transformational power of a luxurious wig. Given the girl talk and high-pitched shrieks of laughter you may not immediately notice that the women are transgender with identities that speak to the cultural moment. ���Tangerine�� encompasses dizzying multitudes ��� it��s a neo-screwball chase flick with a dash of Rainer Werner Fassbinder ��� but mostly movingly it is a female-friendship movie about two people who each started life with an XY chromosome set." �� a fast raucously funny comedy about love and other misadventures. That��s true of its main attractions a pair of transgender lookers with motormouths and killer gams as well as the nominally straight men occupying their hearts and minds. Appearances both deceive and delight in this tough yet tender gritty yet gorgeous movie which was made with ingenious skill and what would count as chump change at the big studios. Shot along a grubby stretch of Los Angeles it takes place in the looming shadow of the Hollywood sign but as far from industrial cinema as another galaxy." occasionally hurting step Sin-Dee��s quest takes her across Hollywood which may be a state of mind to some but is a real neighborhood to others. Rarely since Michael Mann directed ���Collateral�� has a filmmaker mapped Los Angeles as lovingly and with such open eyes as Mr. Baker has. This isn��t the usual movie-made city of fallen monotonously stereotypical angels with its suburban mega-fortresses oceanside views clogged freeways and Joan Didion anomie. It is instead a viscerally vibrantly lived-in metropolis filled with people of different hues who walk (in Los Angeles!) ride the subway (yes the subway) hop buses and occasionally jump into the cab of a frisky Armenian Razmik (Karren Karagulian) whose home life and passengers all add layers to the diversified picture." though more remarkable still is Mr. Baker��s casting of Ms. Rodriquez and Ms. Taylor both fluid forceful screen presences. He met Ms. Taylor at the Los Angeles L.G.B.T. Center the 21st-century version of Lana Turner��s apocryphal discovery at Schwab��s; Ms. Taylor introduced him to Ms. Rodriguez. Like Turner an old-fashioned Hollywood invention the women embody an on-screen ideal of sexualized glamorized femininity that means radically different things depending on the bodies expressing it. For Turner femininity could look like a bad performance like tawdry drag even prison. Here it looks like liberation." drugging swearing whoring ��� it��s Hollywood honey." maybe it isn��t. ���Tangerine�� doesn��t dive deep into transgender identity; the movie is a dizzy often exuberant down-and-dirty romp not a lesson. It casually reminds you that femininity is a mask that can be slipped on and off as when Sin-Dee��s voice mischievously drops an octave or when Alexandra reminds a foolish client (Scott Krinsky as the parsimonious John) that she��s easily his physical match. What��s radical about ���Tangerine�� isn��t identity ��� which enters directly and obliquely playfully and powerfully ��� but that Sin-Dee and Alexandra aren��t limited by it. There��s something blissfully freeing about that just as there��s something shocking when you remember that not long ago characters like these would have often been called on to decorate the story��s edges or just laid out on a slab." honest and unforced. It��s also political (as is the focus however narratively expedient on public transportation) which is sometimes the case when black and brown bodies take up this much time and space on an American movie screen and so beautifully too. Unlike a lot of white directors putatively independent and not Mr. Baker hasn��t simply looked in a mirror for his inspiration but into that infinite world of possibility that is other people. When he bathes Sin-Dee and Alexandra in the luscious orange of another smoggy Los Angeles sunset you may note the warm radiant palette and almost in passing admire how the harmonious performances fit with the gracefulness of the filmmaking ��� but what you see really see are two women shimmering in the sun." from a script by the director Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch is largely an excuse to chase after Sin-Dee and Alexandra as they navigate the frayed less-familiar margins of Los Angeles. It��s Christmas Eve and Sin-Dee having been released from jail is looking to reconnect with her boyfriend and pimp Chester (James Ransone) when she learns that he��s stepped out on her. That cheating is an occupational prerogative for a pimp doesn��t much concern Sin-Dee who soon is hot in search of Chester and his mystery woman (Mickey O��Hagan as Dinah).

Rather than use this melancholy to deepen the narrative the filmmakers soon yank us back to the buffoonery. Which suggests that taking the writers out of the sitcom might be easier than taking the sitcom rhythms out of their prose." rioting hormones and an ostrich-breeding lesbian." the directors ensure that most of the jokes and emotional beats land on cue. But Ms. Pike and Mr. Tennant are wasted in roles that demand little more than pecking at each other like angry gulls and the excellent dramatic actress Amelia Bullmore is reduced to an offensive caricature as a menopausal sister-in-law. Yet as the adults squabble and pout the movie is almost saved by a visit to a blessedly peaceful beach where the plot turns dark and Mr. Connolly coaxes a lovely performance from young Emilia Jones as his anxious grandchild."

But in between the film sure wears out the already tired found-footage device." the theater department at Beatrice High School was staging a play called ���The Gallows�� that went disastrously wrong when the pivotal set piece malfunctioned and left the male lead dead. Twenty years later the department (this is the improbable part; no school would allow such a thing) decides to restage the same play apparently as some kind of anniversary tribute." a boorish jock with a gorgeous girlfriend (Cassidy Gifford daughter of Frank and Kathie Lee). Rickety camerawork has been almost mandatory in horror movies for the last few decades and it has long since ceased to add to the scariness. Mostly it��s just annoying and that��s certainly the case in this bothersome film directed by Chris Lofing and Travis Cluff." four students including the play��s male and female stars (Reese Mishler and Pfeifer Brown) find themselves trapped in the auditorium by sinister forces.

many will find ���Stations of the Cross�� heartbreaking and infuriating. Others may laugh out loud at her mother a walking nightmare of pious punishing rectitude." the movie with a screenplay by the director and Anna Br�_ggemann his sister is a relentlessly harsh critique of religious extremism and its devastating effect on Maria (Lea van Acken) a vulnerable 14-year-old. Maria takes to heart the lectures by Father Weber (Florian Stetter) a young priest in the so-called Society of St. Paul an ultraconservative offshoot of the Roman Catholic Church modeled on the Society of Saint Pius X. In the opening scene he drills her preconfirmation class on church doctrine and calls the students ���warriors of faith.�� After the class Maria lingers and asks him how one becomes a saint." �� an austere beautifully filmed and powerfully acted portrait of extreme religious fervor that slyly flirts with comedy." �� the satire by the Austrian director Ulrich Seidl. Ms. Weisz��s genuinely scary portrayal of wrathful unhinged puritanism bordering on madness may make some cynics howl with laughter at its campy excess." 4-year-old Johannes (Linus Fluhr) has yet to speak a word and may be autistic.

But because the repertory includes gospel and soul which her mother considers Satan��s tools Maria reluctantly turns down the invitation." who rules her family with a tyrannical fervor. The intensity of her tirades about Satan��s wiles bring to mind Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford fulminating against the use of wire hangers in the movie ���Mommie Dearest�� or Piper Laurie in ���Carrie.�� Father Weber and Maria��s family insist that their church which disdains other forms of Catholicism is the one true way." she lies and says it is a girl. Even the tiniest white lie when suspected is enough to make her mother fly into a rage. She is so fanatically vigilant and withholding of approval that Maria becomes convinced her mother doesn��t love her anymore." she begins to waste away believing that if she sacrifices her life Johannes will be able to speak." although extremely far-fetched to see ���Stations of the Cross�� as a genuinely religious work exalting self-deprivation in pursuit of eternal life. Each of the film��s 14 scenes was filmed in a single take and illustrates a different station in a traditional Roman Catholic sequence of images depicting Jesus on the day of his Crucifixion. The movie throws a crumb to true believers in what appears to be a miracle wrought by Maria near the end of the movie. Or is it just a sarcastic tease?"

This material makes for uneasy viewing as do some of her agonizing self-portraits. The director Asif Kapadia doesn��t directly answer whether the public wanted to see Ms. Winehouse hit bottom or were instead force-fed her downfall though this question haunts the movie.

It��s a catchy song and made her a mint but I��ll never hear it the same way again after seeing this documentary mostly because scene by scene Mr. Kapadia makes a case for just how desperately unfunny it always was. At times in ���Amy �� it seems as if Ms. Winehouse by living and crashing so publicly was intent on making the whole world her enabler even if it��s clear she wasn��t the only addict here. Somebody after all buys those tabloids." hard and mercilessly. Mr. Kapadia shows the expected good highs including relationships with other musicians like Yasiin Bey when he was known as Mos Def. There are the inevitable bad highs too including those that helped destroy her health and transform her into tabloid fodder. It��s awful to see and at times infuriating as when Jay Leno who had welcomed her onto ���The Tonight Show �� makes jokes about her drug use with repulsive callousness. And while she sometimes tried to dodge the public she seemed incapable of escaping it ��� us ��� whether by choice or not. The documentary becomes progressively more difficult to watch as Ms. Winehouse falls apart and as its intimacy which earlier felt nice and cozily warm starts to feel uncomfortably intrusive." Ms. Winehouse had a manager Nick Shymansky who was 19 when they joined forces. Their professional relationship turned into a deep enduring friendship a bond that benefits this movie enormously. Ms. Winehouse��s label Universal Music UK commissioned the movie and gave Mr. Kapadia full creative control one reason that it��s spikier tougher and more interesting than the usual official biographies-hagiographies. Universal also provided Mr. Kapadia complete access to her musical catalog which allows you to track her through her music and not only through the testimonials of her family friends and colleagues. Equally important Mr. Shymansky Ms. Ashby and Ms. Gilbert all cooperated with Mr. Kapadia sharing their Amy through their archives as well as joyous and chokingly emotional remembrances." he has pieced together the visuals exclusively from archival images tapping into a trove of home videos concert material publicity interviews and recording sessions. (Among the highlights is a piercingly moving session with a gentle supportive Tony Bennett.) Like many who have come of age in the digital era Ms. Winehouse and her friends seemed to have kept a running record of their lives cataloging their waking and sleeping hours their back-seat and backstage lulls; Mr. Shymansky alone gave Mr. Kapadia 12 hours of video. All this personal documentation as well as Mr. Kapadia��s decision not to incorporate any new on-camera interviews sometimes gives the movie the feel of a diary." though there��s a great deal more to this documentary than sad spectacle. The larger outline of Ms. Winehouse��s story is more or less well known having been previously packaged and sold through public relations and the entertainment media those mutually dependent engines of contemporary celebrity culture. Mr. Kapadia opens that story when Ms. Winehouse is around 14 and goofing around on video in a house with some pals including her lifelong friends Juliette Ashby and Lauren Gilbert. They were girls from suburban northwest London and come across as ordinary teenagers until Amy opens the throttle on ���Happy Birthday �� the words pouring out in a low rich quaver. The voice is already there." which is delightful as you��re getting to know her early on when she��s all shy charming smiles and having her first successes. In its rise-and-fall arc her star-is-born/star-is-dead story is painfully familiar; she is bluntly just one more name now etched on our pop-cultural mausoleum. Yet as this movie reminds you again and again the commercial entity known as Amy Winehouse was also a human being and it��s this person this Amy whom you get to know through all the lovely little details knowing winks funny asides and barbed observations that help make the movie memorable. Ms. Winehouse was surprisingly funny down home sharp and seemingly self-knowing as suggested by her voiced fears about becoming famous." �� a poem that Ted Hughes addressed to his children and by extension critics and fans he writes of ���a kind of hyena�� tearing at the body of his dead wife Sylvia Plath. ���They dug her out. Now they batten/On the cornucopia/Of her body.�� In ���Amy �� a shattering biographical portrait of the British singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse you catch sight of some other hyenas every time the paparazzi go in for the kill. The photographers shove their cameras toward her haunted face and ravaged body ripping at her with each new shot." �� Mr. Kapadia isn��t simply revisiting Ms. Winehouse��s life and death but also ��� by pulling you in close to her first pleasantly and then unpleasantly ��� telling the story of contemporary celebrity and crucially fandom��s cost. She obviously enjoyed some of what fame gave her but it also delivered swarms of paparazzi and made for a few unhealthy relationships. Ms. Winehouse��s family has complained that the movie is ���misleading and contains some basic untruths.�� Mr. Kapadia however doesn��t seem to have needed to work hard to make some members of Ms. Winehouse��s circle look bad; they do a fine job of that themselves."

Somehow the newly born wasps as they burst from their hosts retain recognizable traces of their former habitats: a face here a little dog��s body there." and Mr. Collins relishes his role as a dilettante replacing his human mother with one of the arthropodal variety. The headliners of course are the monsters and Mr. Diez a former effects specialist skillfully blends viscous textures with cheesy digital flourishes.

An old-fashioned hero on top of everything else is also virtuous." sweeping drama ���The Wind That Shakes the Barley �� which was set during the Irish War of Independence (1919-22) and won the director now 79 the Palme d��Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Issues that boiled through that film are sidestepped in ���Jimmy��s Hall �� whose workmanlike screenplay was written by Mr. Loach��s longtime collaborator Paul Laverty." it becomes a popular social hub that offers classes in dance poetry and boxing and attracts visitors from other parishes. Yet the hall whose ownership is hotly disputed is also a rallying point for land-use reformers protesting the eviction of impoverished tenants from the estates of wealthy landowners. Father Sheridan who remembers Jimmy from back when is outspoken in his belief that the sole responsibility for education lies with the church. He and Jimmy inevitably clash." �� a likable period piece directed by the social-realist British filmmaker Ken Loach is its unswerving belief in old-fashioned populist heroes. Such a hero is Jimmy Gralton (Barry Ward) a real-life Irish firebrand portrayed as an articulate courageous natural leader without a shred of grandiosity. Jimmy is a man of the people whose defiance of the powers that be eventually lands him in deep trouble." we never hear him utter the dreaded C-word. Father Sheridan sounding like a forerunner of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy uses it like a cudgel in sermons that equate the ���pelvic thrusts�� of dancing with radical political subversion and rails against ���the Los Angelesation�� of Irish culture. The dancing metaphor is so insistent that at times ���Jimmy��s Hall�� begins to feel like a Depression-era ���Footloose.��" after living in New York for 10 years returns to his home in County Leitrim to help his mother run the family farm. Jimmy arrives with a gramophone and some early jazz records that he uses to teach dancing at Pearse-Connolly Hall an abandoned community center that he and his friends refurbish." whose local representative Father Sheridan (Jim Norton) is an evenhanded portrait of an oppressor.

There��s also a Greek pirate queen to give the action a boost while the frame of a storytelling village elder keeps it from getting too intense." the animated feature ���Zarafa�� follows an African boy Maki on his trek across deserts oceans and the city of Paris to save a friend. Set in the early 1820s when the pasha of Egypt famously gave a giraffe to King Charles X of France this hand-drawn French adventure is a children��s story in the routine template of many friends-and-villains quests but with a fresh historical setting and a serenely subdued look." ���Zarafa�� may not be the most groundbreaking feat of storytelling but it does have a giraffe in a balloon." R�mi Bezan�_on and Jean-Christophe Lie who supervised the animation on ���The Triplets of Belleville �� drop in some potty humor but also make jabs at the racism of the king and other intolerance.

It opens with a grabber features juicy characters and has a discernible story arc tremendous momentum and a musical score that too often accentuates the obvious. What��s missing is a directorial point of view including about vigilante groups the so-called war on drugs and Mexican and American policies and politics. When Mr. Foley mentions for instance that the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled his organization an extremist group the comment simply hangs there. Mr. Heineman doesn��t ask Mr. Foley if the charge has justification or press him on whether that plays into why he trains his sights on the border. Mr. Heineman just keeps shooting running and gunning." to judge from ���Cartel Land �� his immersive documentary about American and Mexican vigilante groups he also has guts and nerves of steel. Serving as the primary cinematographer he employs a run-and-gun style for much of the movie using a lightweight digital camera that at times lurches so dramatically that you can visualize the body attached to it. Considering that Mr. Heineman landed in a few shootouts while making this documentary both his camera moves and its pictorial quality are striking." politics and practice of vigilantism. For much of the movie he switches between Mr. Foley and Dr. Mireles who register as very different men with distinctive methods manners lives and presentational styles. What they share is proficiency with guns a certain swagger and a similar justification for their groups: The cartels are terrorizing us the government isn��t protecting us and we need to fight back. Mr. Foley and Dr. Mireles never meet on screen but the editing joins them turning the men into a united front. And because they more or less have the floor as it were throughout the movie it becomes a platform for their beliefs." which has left thousands dead to appreciate Dr. Mireles��s questions; and you may also have strong ethical and political views on vigilantism. Yet the film moves so quickly and fluidly and with such unnerving violence that it doesn��t give you much time or space to think through the serious urgent issues it raises. When you��re confronted with an image of human heads lined up as if they were at a fruit stand or a woman tearfully describing the barbaric murder of a baby it can be difficult to get past the shock and horror.

Fewer movie entrances now seem more providential than that of the Terminator who materializes in an Atlas crouch unfurls his nude body in all its tumescent splendor and strides over to a panorama of Los Angeles. There he flashes a city that his cyborg will soon invade on the screen and that the actor would later oversee off screen as the governor of California. And now Mr. Schwarzenegger 67 is yes back because while the series thrill is lamentably long gone franchises now apparently last forever." simply because you end up toggling between memories of Mr. Cameron��s kinetic original while watching this latest reboot lurch from one narratively clotted turn to another. The director Alan Taylor has racked up loads of credits in cable TV but his work here is disappointingly flat even in the intimate exchanges between Ms. Clarke and Jai Courtney who��s been similarly miscast as Kyle Reese Sarah��s protector and sparring partner. It��s too bad that Jason Clarke ��� who plays John Connor and gives the character a visceral intensity of both a war-front warrior and a revolutionary on fire ��� isn��t in more scenes. It��s amusing to see identical Arnolds clash like titans but nobody here seems to have fully grasped that they had another heavyweight in Mr. Clarke." the Terminator had switched sides and was aiding the human resistance. It has been doing the same ever since to the point that in ���Genisys �� it has mutated into a blockbuster version of the Tin Man a machine that accompanies a dystopian Dorothy down a hairpin road with various friends while chased by digital-age equivalents of screaming monkeys. The largely still impassive still mighty Mr. Schwarzenegger remains the franchise��s greatest attraction and most-special effect even if he sometimes brings to mind one of those gruffly lovable geezers that older stars can��t resist playing so they can keep basking in our adoration. It��s a performance edged in nostalgia though if your eyes mist when he utters his famous tagline it will mostly be because ��� as in that scene with the dueling cyborgs ��� this movie foolishly keeps invoking the first film." the old Arnold Schwarzenegger goes up against the new. The older version has the smoothly pampered skin of the best beauty treatments that Hollywood money can buy with scarcely a visible line etching his sharply angled and ironed facial planes. Now though the new movie��s cyborg has abruptly come deadpan to deadpan with an unlined recently minted identical twin that like the original Terminator in 1984 has entered without any clothes. It��s strange to see Old and Young Arnold go at it their refrigerator-size bodies slamming against each other in what plays like an intimate existential clash." there are special effects muscles and explosions boomity boom boom. And as before the machines that rule the future having overthrown humanity are trying to kill Sarah Connor in 1984 before she gives birth to her son John who will lead the human resistance. Played with swelling biceps and enjoyably bad attitude by Linda Hamilton in the first two films Sarah here hits as hard as a Kewpie doll what with the casting of Emilia Clarke.

and comedy isn��t school even if the Three Stooges have taught us much. It all depends on context which is why some pokes in the eye are funny and others aren��t. And maybe this movie might have been funny (or at least tolerably wince-worthy) before dead black bodies again became an emblem of our national trauma. The audience I saw ���Ted 2�� with though seemed both uncomfortable with the Kardashian joke and unsure of how to respond which was notable considering how pumped it had seemed before the movie. Some people laughed some tittered nervously some groaned. The uneasiness I think came from a deep unsettled recognition that many of us share these days: No matter what we tell ourselves we have not really figured out how to talk about race much less joke about it. Mr. MacFarlane sure hasn��t." bodily fluids and dope." but ���Ted 2�� is insultingly lazy hack work that is worth discussing primarily because of how he tries and fails to turn race and specifically black men into comedy fodder. Again the story involves Ted who once upon a time was transformed from a fuzzy-wuzzy into a trash-talking dope-smoking insult puppet. It opens with Ted��s marrying a dim bulb an actual woman Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth); soon afterward they decide they want a baby. Because stuffed animals don��t have the right equipment Ted and company try to harvest some suitable heirloom seed. This leads to the movie��s only genuinely funny moment: a sight gag in which Ted dresses up in yellow rain gear like Paddington the Bear while attempting to procure Tom Brady��s sperm." �� the title character ��� a stuffed toy bear voiced by Mr. MacFarlane ��� and his dimwitted best friend John (Mark Wahlberg) visit a comedy club to engage in a favorite pastime: throwing bleak improv ideas at the comics onstage. So seated in the back of the auditorium while cloaked in darkness the friends start shouting out suggestions like 9/11 Robin Williams and Charlie Hebdo to the unnerved comics. The topics don��t mean anything to Ted and John who like Mr. MacFarlane take great pleasure in making others squirm. They could have just as easily yelled gang rape the Holocaust and dead puppies." most important a legal battle that forces him to prove he��s human rather than property. To that end Mr. MacFarlane aligns Ted��s struggle with enslaved black Americans so that while watching a scene in ���Roots�� in which Kunta Kinte is whipped Ted jokes that he��s just like the brutalized slave. The joke is absurd weird and unfunny and it exemplifies Mr. MacFarlane��s reliance on surface shocks as well as his assumption that engaging with race is merely a matter of putting black people on-screen; or having a black woman ���comically�� explain the history of slavery; or having Ted and John repeatedly employ a vulgarism for black penises. It is a particularly blunt example of the white appropriation of black lives ��� except without all the bad stuff or as the writer Greg Tate once put it with ���everything but the burden.��" �� he generates squirms largely because his humor is so tone deaf. A Freudian might enjoy trying to figure out if his repeated references to black male genitalia represents a fear of black (male) power or something a wee more personal. And Mr. MacFarlane may believe that mechanically reciting words will drain them of their force which superficially recalls Lenny Bruce��s idealistic claim that the repetitive use of a familiar racial slur would do the same. ���The word��s suppression gives it the power �� Bruce said in 1962 ���the violence the viciousness.�� History has proved otherwise and the word its violence and viciousness are still with us. I think that Mr. MacFarlane knows this and that��s why he cast a few well-known black actors in authority roles as if to signal wink-wink that the race stuff is just all in good fun." people!) but doesn��t have the skills to do so. Less charitably he doesn��t have the mind-set the compassion or actual interest. He wants to be an equal-opportunity insulter which is impossible because there is no genuine equality either on-screen or off. That doesn��t mean that race or black penises can��t be turned into comedy gold as Mel Brooks figured out in ���Blazing Saddles.��" the default complaint of those who just want their critics to shut up. If anything American comedies need to take on race more to test boundaries and audiences alike. First though they have to grasp the differences between appropriation and engagement and between comedy that supports the racist status quo and comedy that shreds it to pieces. Just sliming us doesn��t cut it." John accidentally knocks over a shelving unit and ends up splashed with ejaculate that a nurse explains has been excluded because the donors have sickle cell anemia. As John writhes Ted laughs. ���You��re covered in rejected black guys�� sperm �� Ted says. ���You��re like a Kardashian.�� Mr. Wahlberg plays the moment with the right level of desperation but Ted��s lines are depressing and desperate. The Kardashians are an easy target as James Franco and Seth Rogen showed with their sendup of a Kanye West and Kim Kardashian music video with its motorcycle ride into a Russ Meyer-esque valley of bosoms and sunsets. That parody was more silly than cruel but when considered together with the original it managed to touch on taste celebrity and gender. It also didn��t debase its subjects."

�� a science-fiction fantasy in a deliberately subtle key. It��s set in the near future and big-city life appears to hum along very much as it does now what with the digital billboards and soaring glass-and-metal towers and despite the occasional zippy low-moving aircraft. The director Jennifer Phang never explains who��s piloting those sleek flying discs or setting off the periodic explosions that scarcely rock this world. The most urgent concerns for Gwen (Jacqueline Kim) throb out a familiar beat: child career enough water to live." which emerges when Gwen starts experiencing some weird problems at work. For some time she has served as a spokeswoman for the bland-sounding Center for Advanced Health and Living one of those creepy medical technology outfits vibrating with menace that suggest untold horrors both scientific and bureaucratic. The movie��s sound design can register as overly thin too absent of the hum of real life (and kitchen appliances) but its hush works perfectly for an organizational sarcophagus like the center. There a couple of crypt-creepers Fisher (James Urbaniak excellent) and Isa (Jennifer Ehle perfect) murmur and scheme primarily about Gwen and a new procedure seemingly solely for women that will change their faces bodies and perhaps souls." Jules (Samantha Kim) a girl of around 12. Times are tough although it takes a while to suss out how bad life is. That��s partly because as a storyteller Ms. Phang tends to be an under-sharer preferring to drop narrative breadcrumbs rather than chunks of exposition. For the most part the characters don��t talk all that much and she��s similarly reserved. She prefers show over tell and will insert an image or idea without filling in details or context. This can be useful for creating mystery and misdirection and initially it seems as if Gwen��s single gravest problem is affording a fancy school for Jules." contemporary science-fiction movies are just thrillers pumped up with special effects and the latest in zap-gun futurology. Big-wow explosions and franchise brands tend to matter more than ideas in these tricked-out action flicks especially in the shiniest priciest major-studio releases. Every so often though a small-scale thoughtful movie like ���Advantageous�� comes along and summons up a speculative new world with brains some frugal sleight of hand and the cool confidence that in the future our greatest threat won��t be rampaging robots or alien invasions but the same hard-charging menace that��s haunted the planet since time immemorial ��� people." who wrote the script with Ms. Kim throws a lot into her movie ��� ideas about maternity identity and technologies of the female body swirl alongside nods to the French New Wave ��� without always connecting the pieces.

If that doesn��t give you pause then consider the words of Simone��s daughter Lisa Simone Kelly who in ���What Happened�� says that while her mother rarely talked about how race affected her childhood she was told that ���her nose was too big her lips were too full and her skin too dark.�� For Simone and the country she lived in and left the country that made her famous when she played one role and rejected her when she played another appearances were never just skin deep; they cut to the bone of her existence much like her voice."

Simone started singing and playing piano in a New Jersey bar in 1954 the year of Brown v. Board of Education. By the time she had a hit in 1959 with the standard ���I Loves You Porgy �� Emmett Till was dead Rosa Parks had refused to give up her seat and federal troops were protecting black students in Little Rock Ark. A decade later Simone��s songbook included ���Four Women�� (with the lyric ���my skin is black��) and ���To Be Young Gifted and Black.��" Ms. Garbus lets her choices speak for her and she occasionally errs both in some of her sight-and-sound juxtapositions and by folding in too much of Simone��s ex-husband Andrew Stroud who tends to run down his wife and her politics. Ms. Garbus also stumbles when she combines images of Black Panther members with Mr. Stroud grousing about Simone and what he calls unchallenged ���extreme militant terrorists.�� What��s missing are dialectics. Because when you see Simone read an unidentified poem at a 1969 festival in Harlem that asks ���Are you ready to kill if necessary? �� she didn��t do so as a solitary black woman. She was reading a work by David Nelson a member of a radical group of artists and she was speaking for many. I imagine she still is." so did her social circle and civil rights activism. Her metamorphosis culturally and politically features a glittering cast of figures ��� James Baldwin Langston Hughes Lorraine Hansberry among others ��� and makes for thrilling viewing. There��s a short clip of her singing ���Mississippi Goddam�� to Selma marchers in 1965; I��m pretty sure that��s Coretta Scott King watching in the lower right corner of the frame. For Simone these were profound life- and soul-changing times. ���I don��t mind going without food or sleep as long as I am doing something worthwhile to me such as this �� she wrote in her diary. These entries can be eye-opening yet they also can feel too intrusive particularly as she struggles with what may have been bipolar disorder." ���What Happened Miss Simone?�� begins in 1976 with Simone performing at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. (The movie opens in theaters on Wednesday and will be available to stream on Netflix on Friday.) She had moved to Liberia two years earlier a willing exile from the United States. ���The America I��d dreamed of through the ��60s seemed like a bad joke �� she wrote in her 1991 memoir ���with Nixon in the White House and the black revolution replaced by disco.�� Her memoir ���I Put a Spell on You�� (written with Stephen Cleary) is part of a small if growing body of Simone studies that has swelled in recent years and includes assorted published histories and ���Nina �� an unreleased biographical movie starring Zoe Saldana as the singer." purring or in full roar anchors ���What Happened �� which traces Simone��s life from her early childhood as a piano prodigy named Eunice Waymon to her troubled years ��� mentally physically spiritually ��� and finally her later return to glory.

�� a comedy that coyly dips its toe and a few other body parts in the new sexual revolution. With its couple-on-couple story the movie comes across as a skittish redo of Paul Mazursky��s 1969 sex comedy ���Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice �� about two chummy straight married couples who end up between the sheets together. Mr. Mazursky��s dramatically shaded comedy is somewhat of a feature-long tease despite its famous image of the four lined up in bed. (Bob and company aren��t the swingers that they try to be.) But it��s also a sharp exploration of the kind of middle-class social anxieties that vibrate through ���The Overnight.��" penis penis." tapping into something real and sweetly touching. That isn��t a reference to any lovemaking but to how Mr. Brice revisits many of the same issues (sex love marriage the safety of convention) that Mr. Mazursky took on 46 years ago. Curiously ���Bob & Carol�� is experiencing something of a moment having also been invoked in the finale of ���Mad Men.�� That show ends in 1970 with Don Draper at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur Calif. where he chants ���om�� in anticipation of the Me Generation and its narcissism. In ���The Overnight �� Alex & Emily & Kurt & Charlotte stay closer to home where huddled together confused and searching they briefly follow their bliss by trading in the Me for a We." much of ���The Overnight�� transpires over a long evening that begins with Alex and Emily having dinner with Kurt and his wife Charlotte (Judith Godr��che) and evolves into an increasingly raucous adult play date with a lot of sharing and two humorously suggestively brandished penises. Other than those wagging (false) appendages and the lead actors�� expressive faces there isn��t much to look at. With few exceptions the movie has a dingy palette that��s familiar from lower-budget digitally shot movies and its trembling camerawork is best described as functional. Every so often Mr. Brice and his team saturate the proceedings with some vivid color including a sly playful blue that foreshadows the story��s turn to the frisky and a red that accents a kinky detour." Alex and Emily are unreservedly conventional but don��t want to be (or perhaps be seen as being) too straight in all senses of that word as telegraphed by Alex��s 2009-era goatee and their Silver Lake address. They��re not bohemians; they��re bohemian adjacent. It��s unclear if Mr. Brice means for them to be quite this ordinary but their banality and unease about fitting in works because it makes them nice foils for Kurt who by flamboyant contrast contains scripted multitudes. That��s telegraphed both by his wardrobe (is his black flat-brimmed hat a hipster an Amish or a Hasidic accouterment?) and by the almost-manic friendliness that he exhibits when he first rockets toward Alex and Emily." while watching over their son RJ (RJ Hermes). Having recently landed in Los Angeles Alex and Emily are worried about making new friends especially because he��s a stay-at-home dad. She has some kind of tech job but the writer-director Patrick Brice isn��t big on shading his characters with lived-in believable details and well Alex and Emily aren��t all that memorable. They��re so nice polite and smiley-face dull that it��s hard to imagine spending an entire movie with them even if they are played by the likable Mr. Scott and Ms. Schilling resourceful performers who can make you believe there��s something going on with their characters even when the rest of the movie suggests otherwise." it feels as if Mr. Brice is less interested in any larger social ideas than in a face-off between two old adversaries: the squares and the kooks. Much of the movie��s laughs are generated by Kurt a caricature of eccentricity whom Mr. Schwartzman turns into a human being. Mr. Schwartzman always appears to be playing himself even if he��s only playing who we think he is. He��s dependably delightfully unpredictable and can shift fluidly from funny-ha-ha to funny-menacing vulnerable to volatile. That��s partly because of his looks (he uses his luxurious hair transformationally the way other actors use wigs) but also because of how he deploys them including a deadpan that can leave you wondering if it��s time to laugh or run."

Whatever the reason she sticks with Cam although he can��t hold down a job and she wants to send Amelia and their youngest Faith (Ashley Aufderheide) to private schools.

Cam doesn��t need a lecture on race just a reality check. After dispensing one Maggie goes off to Columbia University to earn an M.B.A. parking her family in Cambridge Mass. and promising to visit on weekends." true-life family stories tend to come so drenched in despair or smothered in treacle that it��s a surprise anyone gets out intact. In her sweet somewhat nutty feature debut ���Infinitely Polar Bear �� the writer-director Maya Forbes looks back on her 1970s childhood in a fictional re-creation that as it brightly skips along can make you feel like Scrooge for thinking it��s a bit of a snow job. That��s especially the case because the father here Cam Stuart (the infinitely warm Mark Ruffalo) is an endearingly down-and-out eccentric with manic depression." Maggie is the most interesting character in the movie partly because of her ambition partly because of how she navigates race. But she��s also underwritten and the grit that she initially exhibits fades amid the laughter and mothering. When she��s home it��s with a family that depending on Cam��s moods is either giddily alive or on the verge of disaster but somehow always humming forward. Ms. Forbes��s bouncy approach can seem wildly off-key as the screaming fights questionable parenting choices and sad days pile up. The movie isn��t altogether believable in some of its ordinary details (the family��s apartment is more bohemian dishabille than squalid) or in its characterizations perhaps because Ms. Forbes remembers it this way or simply likes accentuating the positive." tearing toward his family on a bicycle in the middle of what appears to be a full-blown manic episode. At that early point in the story his eldest Amelia (Imogene Wolodarsky) has already more or less warned you about Cam having sketched out his past in one of those breezy family-album introductions that turn lives into highlight reels: Harvard diagnosis marriage and children. In voice-over Amelia who��s around 10 insists that her mother Maggie (Zoe Saldana) ���didn��t care�� about Cam��s illness and that the family was happy even if ���there��s more to it than that.�� A few beats later Cam is coming on like a storm in those red shorts while Maggie is hustling suitcases and children into a car." part magical madman and about the cuddliest most adorable mentally ill character imaginable. That��s in keeping with the rest of this movie which ��� from its cute title to a jangly musical score that��s sweetened with clapping and childish voices ��� remains insistently upbeat so much so that it too can feel as if it were in the grip of a manic episode. It��s an approach that can make this a tough story to fall for and wouldn��t work in a film that engages with mental illness as a cause. But in ���Infinitely Polar Bear �� Ms. Forbes hasn��t made a movie about her father��s illness; she��s made one about her father who through hard and weird times clearly helped give her what she needed so that one day she could tell this story."

It��s a nicely framed shot and reminiscent of a crucial visual signature of the Belgian directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. The Dardennes use hand-held cameras to create extreme physical proximity with their characters turning the cinematographer into a ���corps-cam�ra�� or body camera. This closeness isn��t an empty formal tic but instrumental for an ethics of filmmaking (and what the scholar Joseph Mai nicely calls their ���sensuous realism��) in which the camera as Luc writes ���seeks to follow.��" �� though with more French flag waving and less storeroom romancing: Benjamin and his colleagues navigate through the hospital chaos comforting the sick and quietly or heatedly making life and death decisions.

Alas Benjamin isn��t readily teachable or even very interesting (Mr. Lacoste��s slack unfocused performance doesn��t help) which would be fine if his vacuity were intentional or useful and if the naturally charismatic Mr. Kateb didn��t make you wonder why he wasn��t the star." �� the palsied camera tends to zip around excitedly jumping from face to face and room to room in the hospital that serves as a second home for Benjamin (Vincent Lacoste).

As an intern Benjamin should be seeking to follow but he��s a young swaggerer and of course also unsure of himself. That��s a familiar combustible combination. Unsurprisingly in a hospital it is also a dangerous mix that ends in a fatal mistake that generates one complication after another for Benjamin; his father Barois (Jacques Gamblin) who helps run the hospital; and an Algerian doctor serving as an intern Abdel (the reliably great Reda Kateb)." vitals checked brows furrowed turfs protected and glasses clinked in ���Hippocrates: Diary of a French Doctor �� which is more or less what its title announces.

She was from the Midwest he was from Peru and together they traveled the United States and had seven children (including Visnu a disabled daughter) to whom they gave Sanskrit names" one that��s further distinguished by the persuasive intimacy that comes from the Angulo brothers�� sincerity and openness and their obvious love for their family. Ms. Moselle��s affable informality adds to the intimacy ��� the brothers tend to come across more like friends than subjects ��� as does the claustrophobia of their apartment a warren of rooms with a long hall that seems to grow shorter as the movie unfolds. In one arresting video snippet a few brothers zip down that hall on scooters followed by another wearing in-line skates.

That was the world that they watched from their windows as it indifferently passed them by." disarmingly optimistic documentary sound desperately sad when it��s anything but.

It��s easy to imagine what an exploitative director using artful editing and a sinister score could have done to darken this material. At the same time it��s hard to imagine a more sensitive director for this story than Crystal Moselle a 34-year-old who five years ago discovered the brothers soon after they began making unaccompanied excursions outside. Sometimes all you need is a great subject to make a great documentary ��� or a willingness to chase after total strangers." candidly and obliquely and given their ages it never feels as if Ms. Moselle is exploiting them; she never prods them at least on camera to reveal more than they seem to want to.

You��re left with the sense that something went wrong for this family but that whatever did (no laws seem to have been broken) is none of our business. ���The Wolfpack�� is a reminder that documentary cinema isn��t a license to snoop into other lives (sometimes all you need is a cordial visit) and that while movies can save lives that works only if there is also as much love as there is here."

There is no introductory text to set the scene and no voice-over to fill in the gaps; the movie just opens on a bleak New York cityscape the camera skittishly poking around outside a brick high rise. The only people who speak in the movie are the Angulos and presumably Ms. Moselle so you have to take it on faith that everything in it is true. (Ms. Moselle doesn��t identify herself but I assume that��s her tossing out periodic off-camera remarks.) Yet what might elsewhere register as problematic including a restricted focus and borderline na�ve approach actually strengthens the movie." but can they save it? For most people that probably sounds foolish but the six brothers featured in the astonishing documentary ���The Wolfpack�� aren��t most people. For much of their lives these six ingenious young men used the movies to imaginatively if not physically break out of their Lower Manhattan apartment in a building run by the New York City Housing Authority. Even as their father all but imprisoned them (one year they never left the apartment) they made great metaphoric escapes by immersing themselves in the fictional realms created by directors like Francis Ford Coppola and Quentin Tarantino."

With its global brand recognition ���Jurassic World�� comes with more muscle than the average big-ticket behemoth one that��s been built on best-selling novels three earlier flicks theme-park attractions and the usual marketing tie-ins. Once again dinosaurs are on the roam an unpeaceable kingdom that is an index of the folly of man trying to play God. In reality there��s more flab than muscle packed on this galumphing franchise reboot which as it lumbers from scene to scene reminds you of what a great action god Steven Spielberg is. Too bad he didn��t take the reins on this." although it��s unclear if the filmmakers were trying to tweak politically correct sensibilities or thought they were being clever or maybe both. Whatever the case the heels are just silly and a distraction given that they��re nowhere near as insulting as the rest of her. Owen may be a parody of a hunk what with his greasy workingman hands shirt-busting arm muscles and nicely coiffed chin hair but at least he does cool stuff like wrangle raptors and spoiler alert Claire. She mostly just schemes and screams before Owen melts her like an ice cube on a hot griddle proving that yes she��s every bit as bad as Joss Whedon thought when on Twitter he called out ���Jurassic World�� as sexist: ���She��s a stiff he��s a life-force ��� really? Still?�� Yes still." �� which pivots on an entrepreneur cum carny Hammond (Richard Attenborough who directed ���Gandhi��) who could be a stand-in for any Big Man of cinema. It��s Hammond who��s brought dinosaurs back to dangerous life and while he has the vision thing down he also likes to mention the money he��s spent on his spectacle cementing the Hollywood analogy. By the end his hubris nearly does him in and his plans flop a cautionary fictional failure that spawned a real-life smash. Oh the irony or as one of the writers David Koepp said ���I was really chasing my tail there for a while trying to find out what was virtuous in this whole scenario ��� and eventually gave up.��" back in 1993 bleeding-edge computer-generated imagery: the dinosaurs were cool and the filmmaking fluid and vigorous. It��s a resolutely old-fashioned Hollywood adventure movie in many ways but one that felt (feels) paradoxically alive because of Mr. Spielberg��s filmmaking talents and his absolute faith in movies. ���Jurassic World �� by contrast isn��t in dialogue with its cinematic reference points; it��s fossilized by them. From the first shot of a dinosaur hatching (signaling new beginnings etc.) to one of a massive aquatic creature chowing down on a great white shark (get it?) it is clear that the only colossus that��s making the ground shake here is Steven Spielberg." or at least that��s how the filmmakers attempt to skew them with Owen telling Claire that they��re ���ridiculous.�� That Claire can actually run from dinosaurs over cement and through mud without breaking a heel off or twisting her ankle like a film-noir dame is played as a kind of triumph. Of course it��s a hollow one and it��s representative of how the filmmakers like to point out the very clich�s (genre gender whatever) they embrace as if merely acknowledging them were a critical move. By the time Claire is shooting a gun still in heels you may find yourself humming that old fake-feminist jingle: ���I can bring home the bacon/ Fry it up in a pan/ And never let you forget you��re a man.�� That Owen is the hero ensures that you��ll never forget either."

�� James Kent��s stately screen adaptation of the British author Vera Brittain��s 1933 World War I memoir evokes the march of history with a balance and restraint exhibited by few movies with such grand ambitions. Most similar films strain at the seams with bombast and sentimentality. This one with a screenplay by Juliette Towhidi (���Calendar Girls��) is consciously old-fashioned ��� or should I say traditional? ��� while maintaining a sober perspective." smart woman of action who chokes back her fear and revulsion to do what must be done. At no point does ���Testament of Youth�� coddle her with misty soft-focus photography." she rejects the piano her father (Dominic West) gives her and reminds him that it cost the same as a year in college. Contrary to the wishes of her severe eagle-eyed mother (Emily Watson) Vera is not a flower waiting to be picked by a wealthy suitor and her parents are aghast when she announces she will never marry. A wary attraction develops between Vera and Roland both of whom write poetry but they can meet only with a chaperone present. Nevertheless they fall in love." �� however is not fiction; Vera and the other major characters are real-life figures who faced the horrors of the First World War. The movie is also the stronger for having no battle sequences or scenes depicting acts of courage though you hear about such heroics after the fact. There are just enough shots of life in the trenches to give a glimpse of a hell peopled by exhausted mud-covered soldiers who are almost unrecognizable from the vital young men who left Britain thinking they were bound for glory. Other scenes in army hospitals in England and behind the lines in France are unrelievedly grim tableaus." the more she internalizes the grim reality she absorbs. In one of the saddest scenes Roland returns on leave with symptoms of what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder. When she asks if he has written any poems while at the front he contemptuously scoffs: ���Poetry! Oh for God��s sake!��" it reminds you of the degree to which Hollywood molded our ideas of conflict and places ���Testament of Youth�� in a continuum of commercial high-minded war movies." ���Testament of Youth�� avoids the temptation to elicit tears although a reading in the film of Roland Leighton��s poem ���Villanelle�� cuts to the bone. As for the bright handsome eager beavers who excitedly troop off to a war they believe will end in a matter of weeks they haven��t an inkling of the fate that awaits them." then Edward then Victor ��� who pines after Vera ��� succumb to war fever and heed the call to fight.

like musicians in separate recording booths ��� Mr. Cusack and Mr. Dano create a remarkable composite performance a set of before-and-after pictures that is also a perfectly unified hauntingly complex portrait. Mr. Dano gentle and inscrutable as a panda bear conveys the pathos of a young man��s unraveling. The Beach Boys were a family business including Brian��s brothers Carl (Brett Davern) and Dennis (Kenny Wormald) and their cousin Mike Love (Jake Abel). Their rise chronicled in a lively montage of early hits was overseen by Murry Wilson (Bill Camp) an abusive patriarch who hung around to undermine and humiliate his sons Brian in particular even after being fired as the group��s manager." and it holds out a twofold promise: that the film will take viewers inside its protagonist��s head and that it will pay particular attention to the role that sound played in his life." whose sonic collages ������score�� doesn��t quite do justice to his achievement ��� take us deeper inside a musical mind than we might have thought possible. ���Love & Mercy�� doesn��t claim to solve the mystery of Brian Wilson but it succeeds beyond all expectation in making you hear where he was coming from." the sounds in his head take on a sinister cast and his odd behavior and paranoid ramblings frighten his bandmates and his first wife Marilyn (Erin Darke). LSD doesn��t help. By the time he meets Melinda though his breakdown is in the past. He strikes her as a sweet soft-spoken eccentric a pampered rich guy who is also kind and vulnerable. He shocks her sometimes by referring almost casually to the trauma and abuse in his past and gradually reveals the terror that governs his present-day life." this movie a smart compassionate refreshingly unconventional biopic directed by Bill Pohlad makes good on both promises exploring the mental world and the artistic method of a great artist. It��s a loving tribute to the Beach Boys and the man responsible for their distinctive sound but it goes to deeper and stranger places than most movies of its kind. On screen the lives of musicians tend to follow a tried-and-true outline: A rise to fame is followed by a personal and professional crisis often involving drugs which is followed by a redemptive third act. What is often missing from the formula is any real insight into the reason we might be interested in the first place which is the music. We might see our idol more or less persuasively impersonated by a hard-working actor strumming a guitar or noodling at a piano but the complicated labor of creativity is notoriously hard to show on screen." the film shifts back and forth ��� fluidly and seamlessly ��� from the ��60s to the ��80s when Brian now played by John Cusack first meets Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) in a Cadillac showroom in Los Angeles. Their courtship is complicated by the presence of Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti) a psychologist who serves as Brian��s guru dietitian and legal guardian." an accomplished producer who had the cooperation of Mr. Wilson and his wife Melinda doesn��t just overcome this challenge; he makes witnessing the creation of a record as exciting as hearing a classic song for the first time. One of the best things about ���Love & Mercy �� which was written by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner is how long it lingers in the recording studio observing as Brian played in his 20s by Paul Dano is putting together ���Pet Sounds �� by consensus one of the great albums of its era." as the camera lovingly ogles microphones amplifiers and consoles that were state of the art in the mid-1960s. Watching Brian with his boyish face and eager puppy-dog manner adjusting the knobs and directing the session players is like watching a kid in a toy store. He is freer and more confident than ever before layering and sculpting improbable instruments and bewitching harmonies into songs that are at once exquisitely simple and astonishingly sophisticated." in part a trippy excursion into a golden piece of the California past the ��80s section is a spooky Los Angeles noir. Told almost entirely from Melinda��s perspective it follows her discovery of the hidden sinister dimensions of Dr. Landy��s apparent benevolence. A jolly friendly fellow on the surface Landy is both a one-of-a-kind creep (Mr. Giamatti��s smile will give you nightmares as will his hair) and a recognizable type of villain. Melinda whose sunny disposition masks a steely icy resolve makes a very satisfying foil and Ms. Banks��s astute performance in a series of eye-catching period-appropriate outfits is what binds the film together. Melinda is the only person who can love and appreciate Brian for who he is and as such she is the stand-in for the rest of us who admire what he accomplished."

���Doomsdays�� comes at you sideways its melancholy catching you off guard. When the world has passed the environmental tipping point Mr. Mullins ponders how long can the chains of civility hold?" a claim the film��s director Eddie Mullins gradually fleshes out over the course of their shaggy adventures. Rolling through the countryside (steadily framed and verdantly photographed by Cal Robertson) they unexpectedly gather moss in the form of a tubby teenager (Brian Charles Johnson) and a directionless young woman (Laura Campbell). Now part of a shambolic antisocial family Fred and Bruho must confront not only their operating principles but their own dysfunctional partnership." �� but it couldn��t be more essential to our understanding of its two main characters. It��s where they��re from where they��re going and where their heads are at these vagabonds who invade empty vacation homes in the Catskills and squat until forced to move on." Mr. Mullins describes this his first feature as ���a pre-apocalyptic comedy �� but despite the movie��s jabs of slacker humor there��s nothing funny about its underlying concerns. Like the rampaging oldsters in Harmony Korine��s ���Trash Humpers�� (2010) Bruho inarticulately rages against an elite class of overconsumers who he believes are hastening our extinction. The discovery of a survival shelter in one luxury home allows for a riff on the futility of living a few months beyond everyone else but it��s another more disturbing find that kicks the tone from goofy to gloomy."

there is ample pleasure to be gleaned from his formal discipline and his downbeat wit. The travails of the salesmen lend just enough narrative structure to keep your interest and to prevent ���Pigeon�� from scattering into YouTube-ready fragments. Sometimes the perspective slips as in the episode that gives the film its title which seems to depict children with mental disabilities in a way that is both exploitative and sentimental." a man has expired in a cafeteria on board some kind of ferry or cruise ship. Officers and passengers stand around him with expressions of concern but the server has a more practical worry: what to do with the beer and the shrimp sandwich the dead customer had already paid for. A stout older gentleman shuffles forward. ���I guess I��ll take the beer �� he says with a shrug." �� says one of the pair of salesmen (Holger Andersson and Nils Westblom) who are the film��s main recurring characters. Their wares are the kind of novelties that might have been popular at some point in the murky mid 20th century: a ���bag of laughs�� that emits guffaws when opened; ���extra-long�� vampire fangs; a rubber mask in the likeness of a creepy guy called Uncle One-Tooth. They seem even more defeated than their compatriots who at least occasionally break into song or exchange smiles puffs of a cigarette even kisses." since an important aspect of Mr. Andersson��s comic method is that it continually explores its own ethical premises. Why do we laugh at the distress of others and what does it mean to orchestrate such distress as any comic spectacle does with the intention of producing laughter? At one point the more sensitive of the gag salesmen wonders if it��s ever all right to use the suffering of another for one��s own pleasure. His question is provoked by a dream that is also the film��s most haunting and horrific scene a depiction of inhumanity so extreme and so specific that it casts a shadow over everything else that has happened so far. But he may be thinking about the movie he inhabits about its creator and about us pigeons who gaze at the screen and find much to reflect upon." �� like its predecessors consists of short episodes that illustrate mostly the absurd futility of life. The camera is usually stationary observing characters from a tactful distance as they sigh grumble complain and treat one another with cruelty weary civility and occasional tenderness. The visual palette is a wan watery mix of pale yellows browns and greens ��� the colors of bland overcooked food. (The uneaten shrimp in that early scene may be the liveliest creatures in the film.) The music is sometimes grim and foreboding but the most frequently heard tune is a jaunty waltz that functions as a mordant mocking laugh track against the sorrow on screen." the latest feature from the Swedish writer-director Roy Andersson but not much in the way of merriment. Drinks are nursed in bars and cafes meals eaten in solitude. Sometimes what happens crosses the line from the eccentric to the bizarre as when a detachment of the 18th-century Swedish Army led by a young king on horseback enters a drab saloon on the rough edge of a modern industrial city. The monarch needs a bathroom break on the way to fight the Russians. Later the army will pass through again in demoralized retreat which is pretty much the dominant mood in Mr. Andersson��s world." whose other work includes ���Songs From the Second Floor�� and ���You the Living�� and who won the top prize at last year��s Venice Film Festival has perfected a style and sensibility of dry sad philosophically inflected humor that deserves its own special name.

(The snippet we��re shown looks stupider than the movie that contains it but not enough so to make it effective satire.)

(Among these are Warren Buffett Liam Neeson and of course Mark Wahlberg who is also a producer.) Emily Ratajkowski shows up as a love interest for Vince and then discreetly vanishes so that various guys can talk almost respectfully about how hot she is.

A phone call raises Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) Vince��s longtime agent who is coming out of retirement to run a studio." I think she was looking at you. You should totally go for it." and Mr. Connolly��s knowing smirk meant to signal Eric��s integrity has the opposite effect. Turtle? Whatever. Mr. Dillon at least keeps up the strenuous mugging that made Johnny a comic fixture of the show something to give you a chuckle while you waited for the next outbreak of toplessness." ���Entourage�� had grown staler than last night��s Axe body spray. The passing of a few more years has not improved the aroma. Watching the movie is like finding an ancient issue of a second-tier lad mag ��� not even Maxim but Loaded or Nuts ��� in a friend��s guest bathroom. You wonder how it got there. You wonder how you got there." it was the same way the people on screen got there: because someone paid me. Why anyone would run the transaction in reverse is puzzling enough to be worth pondering and also too depressing to contemplate. It��s rare to see a movie of any kind pander to its imagined audience with such unabashed cynicism. On cable there was sometimes a glimmer of satire or a hint of heart and also an appealing pseudo-democratic idea about the accessibility of money and celebrity in a world that worships them. If ordinary guys from Queens like Vince and his bros could make it in Hollywood ��� could score with those hotties drive those cars make that money ��� then anyone could." though. It��s about Hollywood which is to say about the narcissism neediness and sexual entitlement of men. It sometimes pretends to make fun of those things but let��s not kid ourselves. You could accuse it of glamorizing the shallow hedonism it depicts but that charge would only stick if the movie had any genuine flair romance or imagination. Instead it has the frantic Ari whose career once a half-clever inside joke has become a shaggy-dog story. He��s upstaged here by Mr. Thornton��s lean mean Texan whose code of loyalty is equal to Ari��s and who boasts that he never sees the movies he pays for.

Mr. Caissy places us in a featureless room while a fixed camera captures a parade of troubled teenagers in conversation with mostly unseen authority figures.

exquisitely detailed surface ���When Marnie Was There�� bubbles with half-formed ideas and undeveloped themes. Suggestion and subtext jostle for attention and the extent to which they intrude will depend mainly on the age of the viewer. To the tinies this gorgeously animated adaptation of a 1967 young-adult novel by the British author Joan G. Robinson will seem a simple tale of friendship found and unhappiness banished. Others however could experience the story��s sweetly supernatural drift as a veil for gnarlier intimations of child abuse sexual awakening ethnic confusion and even mental illness." a golden-haired beauty with an unsettling tendency to appear and disappear at odd moments everything changes. The seemingly abandoned mansion in the marsh where Marnie lives is transformed at high tide by glamorous parties ��� a glittering world that welcomes Anna as one of its own. Seduced by Marnie��s ardent attentions she barely notices their ominous undertones or her own lapses in memory whenever her new friend is around. Like a princess in a fairy tale Marnie moves in stardust and traffics in mystery." yet the damp caul of loneliness that envelops the film��s early scenes feels moving and true. We don��t have to read the book to suspect that its author ��� who was born in 1910 and lived through two world wars ��� had like Anna more than a theoretical acquaintance with the aftermath of abandonment." Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata recently announced their retirement) ���Marnie�� is psychologically darker and less fantastical than most of the studio��s previous output. Its emphasis on the richness of nature and the fortitude of young girls though remains intact as Anna an asthmatic 12-year-old is sent to live with relatives at the seaside. Orphaned at a young age Anna is an unusually prickly heroine who derides her anxious foster mother (���She whines like a goat!��) and simmers with self-loathing. Sulking outside the ���invisible magic circle�� inhabited by her peers she pours all her emotions ��� including spikes of violence ��� into her drawings." ���Marnie�� is a muddled merger of ghost story fantasy time travel and coming-of-age. Fighting all of these however is a first-love story ��� a passionate connection between two damaged souls. This becomes quite explicit when Anna perpetually dressed like a boy jealously watches Marnie dance with a young man then questions their mutual devotion. But the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi (perhaps mindful of appealing to younger children) only flirts with this and other thornier undercurrents like the suggestion of Marnie��s abuse at the hands of her forbidding maid and the fury with which Anna responds to the suggestion that her eyes are almost blue."

according to the ���Tomorrowland�� timeline we��ve succumbed to pessimism. Where we used to look to the future with hope and excitement we now embrace decline and futility. Everything��s falling apart and instead of making it better most of us just wallow in gloom especially when it comes to entertainment. A billboard advertises something called ���ToxiCosmos 3 �� and to those of us who groove on such visions of apocalypse and catastrophe Mr. Bird has a message: Cut it out! To those of us who can conceive something better the message is: Wake up and start dreaming!" that goes for the whole movie. Its enormous lapses in narrative and conceptual coherence ��� its blithe disregard for basic principles of science-fiction credibility ��� would be less irksome in the fantastical cosmos of animation. And it would look better too. Tomorrowland looks less like a magical city of the future or even the Disney environment it��s meant to evoke than like an unusually clean and efficient airport or the shopping mall beyond the multiplex where you��re seeing the movie." I dare say some ideological ��� contradictions here and a more serious problem of tone. The filmmakers want to dazzle you but they also want to teach you a lesson. In 1965 young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson who will grow up to be George Clooney) arrives at the New York World��s Fair with a big grin and a cool invention. It��s a jetpack made out of an old vacuum cleaner and while it doesn��t quite fly Frank figures that his hard work and can-do spirit will impress the dour judge (Hugh Laurie earmarked for his subsequent bad-guy role) in the inventors�� pavilion. Asked what the use of his contraption is Frank replies that it��s for fun which is its own kind of utility. If people see that such a thing can exist they��ll be inspired. They��ll believe in their own capacities and in the general possibility of good stuff." and then earnest and amiable in a role that dozens of actors could have played. Ms. Robertson is perky and panicky in the same way. Among the characters only Athena has any real distinction and Ms. Cassidy is an intriguing performer funny and a little scary in her composure. Everyone else Mr. Laurie included (and Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key partly excepted) would be better as a cartoon." his screenwriting collaborator run the usual gamut: politics bureaucracy greed bad teachers dumb parents a villain with a long black coat and a British accent. Mostly though the fault lies with humanity itself. We are wonderful creatures capable of dazzling feats of invention and problem-solving but we have a damnable tendency to get in our own way to sell out and sell ourselves short." and of the value of art but it��s a defense that is advanced so bluntly and insistently that it gets in the way of the actual art. At the World��s Fair Frank develops a crush on Athena (Raffey Cassidy) a girl gray-eyed like her namesake goddess who is (to keep the comparisons within the boundaries of the Disney universe) a perfect blend of Mary Poppins and Tinker Bell. Athena hands Frank a pin that is his ticket to Tomorrowland a place founded by some of history��s greatest geniuses as a combination Utopian community R&D lab and ���Atlas Shrugged�� theme park." in our own time a similar pin will come into the possession of Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) a teenager whose irrepressible gumption is expressed through acts of sabotage at the NASA launch platform near her home in Cape Canaveral Fla. She is motivated not by hostility to the space program ��� which used to employ her dad (Tim McGraw) as an engineer ��� but rather by rage that celestial exploration is being abandoned. She wants to halt the dismantling of the facility a wonderfully futile gesture that marks her as a potential savior of Tomorrowland and a new recruit for Plus Ultra the secret club of artists and smarties who populate it. She too meets Athena and they fight off some nasty robots on the way to find Frank now exiled from Tomorrowland and living out his days as a grizzled crank (i.e. as George Clooney) in a ramshackle house equipped with amazing gizmos." of sponsored inducements to emulate various dreamers and disrupters of bland universal appeals to the power of individuality. ���Tomorrowland�� works entirely at that level which is to say in the vocabulary of advertisement. Its idea of the future is abstract theoretical and empty and it can only fill in the blank space with exhortations to believe and to hope. But belief without content without a critical picture of the world as it is is really just propaganda. ���Tomorrowland �� searching for incitements to dream finds slogans and mistakes them for poetry." kids!" but part of Casey��s job is to serve as a kind of on-screen shill cuing the desired audience response by exclaiming ���Whoa that��s amazing!�� or ���Wow incredible!�� at regular intervals. And while some of the images are interesting even startling ��� a visit to the Eiffel Tower for instance ��� the action is more frantic than thrilling and the sense of wonder rarely materializes." �� Brad Bird��s energetic new film a shiny live-action spectacle from Disney reminds me of that guy. There is nothing casual or whimsical about this movie��s celebration of imagination optimism and joy. On the contrary: It��s a determined and didactic argument in favor of all those things and an angry indictment of everyone who opposes them." �� for my money one of the finest movies ever made about the pursuit of artistic excellence. And it��s important to note that ���Tomorrowland�� is not disappointing in the usual way. It��s not another glib phoned-in piece of franchise mediocrity but rather a work of evident passion and conviction."

In Mexico City Tom��s finds his older brother Federico (nicknamed Sombra and played by the witty and soulful Tenoch Huerta) who lives in a filthy high-rise apartment with his roommate Santos (Leonardo Ortizgris). A strike has disrupted their classes but rather than join the other students who are occupying university buildings Sombra and Santos declare themselves ���on strike from the strike.�� Sombra drinks smokes suffers through panic attacks and tries to master a card trick. His only connection to the outside world is Ana (Ilse Salas) a radical whose voice drifts in from a pirate radio station." but she may be involved with another guy a serious activist briefly glimpsed in full revolutionary pomposity at a chaotic meeting. When Santos Sombra and Tom��s finally get it together to leave their pad ��� in flight from the very angry neighbor whose electricity they were borrowing ��� they eventually find Ana and ���G�_eros�� becomes a ragged and romantic road movie. The young people zig and zag quarrel and smoke blithely confusing their own chaotic passions with the movements of history. There is a mission of sorts behind this wandering: to track down Epigmenio Cruz a reclusive singer from the ��60s whose music was so exquisite that he was rumored to have made Bob Dylan cry. (In one of the film��s formal jokes the soundtrack goes silent whenever someone puts on headphones to listen to one of his tunes.)" derogatory but also at least sometimes affectionate for people with light skin a description that fits Tom��s (and Sebastian and Ana) but not Sombra whose nickname means shade or shadow in Spanish. As they meander through poor neighborhoods and fancy parties sampling hedonism idealism and cruel cynicism the viewer catches glimpses of a society seething with contradictions and half-buried class conflict. ���G�_eros�� is like a flip-book history lesson one that evokes the pain and comedy ��� the pop the politics the tedium and the momentousness ��� of a particular moment in the endless cyclical chronicles of youth and disillusionment."

hectic relentlessly linear motion. It starts quietly with Max standing on a dusty outcropping casually snacking on a two-headed gecko as he sketches the relevant background in voice-over. When things started going bad ��� when the world collapsed in a welter of greed violence and stupidity ��� he failed to protect his wife and daughter. Their memory both haunts and grounds him making him able even in the worst circumstances to recognize decency in himself and others." and in encountering surprises along the way. Not twists ��� the plot moves from Point A to Point B and back again ending up pretty much where you knew it would ��� but kinks and swerves tricks of perspective and playful reversals of expectation. A sweet almost wordless romance blossoms between a hapless war boy (Nicholas Hoult) and one of Joe��s brides as she and her comrades evolve from eye candy into a feminist guerrilla force. They are joined by a band of older women called the Vuvalini who along with Furiosa decide to give Immortan Joe��s patriarchy a taste of its own medicine." Mr. Miller��s world has its rules. Viewers raised on the more baroque digitally enabled forms of blockbuster spectacle are likely to admire the relative simplicity of ���Fury Road �� while aficionados of the traditional slam-bang methods will revel in its coherence. Even in the most chaotic fights and collisions everything makes sense. This is not a matter of realism ��� come on now ��� but of imaginative discipline. And Mr. Miller demonstrates that great action filmmaking is not only a matter of physics but of ethics as well. There is cause and effect; there are choices and consequences." �� directed like the others by George Miller is sort of a sequel and also what we��re now supposed to call a reboot. In any case it doesn��t traffic in the kind of half-jokey half-sentimental self-consciousness that characterizes so much franchise entertainment these days. Unlike say ���Avengers: Age of Ultron �� ���Fury Road�� does not usher you into a bright corporate universe where everything has been branded to within an inch of its life. The branding you witness here reminds you of the cruel etymology of the word as a death��s-head insignia ��� the mark of a tyrannical C.E.O. known as Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) ��� is scorched into the flesh of people destined to live as property." and quite rousing as well ��� a large-scale genre movie that is at once unpretentious and unafraid to bring home a message. Way back in the ���Thunderdome�� days Tina Turner sang ���We don��t need another hero.�� That��s more true than ever especially during summer movie season. And ���Mad Max: Fury Road �� like its namesake both humble and indomitable isn��t about heroism in the conventional superpowered sense. It��s about revolution." the whoosh of flames and the squeal of twisting metal ��� all the tried-and-true idioms of action filmmaking to make your heart beat faster. Speed and efficiency are of the essence leavened with nasty biker wit and a blunt distaste for authority." a designated ���blood bag�� kept alive to transfuse one of Joe��s ���war boys �� is Max himself played without a wasted word or gesture but with plenty of expressive grunts and snorts by Tom Hardy. Max a Bogartian loner impelled by conscience to stick his (admirably thick) neck out for somebody is really more sidekick than hero. The chief warrior on this road is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) a rebel with a buzz cut a prosthetic arm a thousand-mile stare and a supremely righteous cause. Joe whose empire runs on slave labor keeps a harem of women for breeding. Furiosa has five of them (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Zo� Kravitz Riley Keough Courtney Eaton and Abbey Lee) hidden in her tanker truck and she��s running a kind of underground railroad operation in the guise of a trading mission. Joe wants his property back and sets out in pursuit with a battalion of war boys a heavy-metal guitarist and a fleet of customized retro-futuristic vehicles." �� released in the United States in 1980 (with a soundtrack that dubbed the thick Australian accents) was a no-money Down Under cult-exploitation movie. ���The Road Warrior�� (1981) was a little fancier but it still had the snarl and velocity of a punk-rock club show. ���Beyond Thunderdome�� (1985) was arena rock by comparison but Mr. Miller ��� whose r�sum� also includes ���The Witches of Eastwick �� ���Babe: Pig in the City�� and both ���Happy Feet�� cartoon-penguin movies ��� has always stayed true to his scrappy pragmatic roots. At 70 he has a master craftsman��s intuitive sense of proportion and a visual artisan��s mistrust of extraneous verbiage." which Mr. Miller wrote with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris has been whittled almost clean of expository dialogue and touchy-feely bushwa. A cut or a pan can explain or express much more than words. When ���Fury Road�� reaches for emotional grandeur it relies on the faces of its cast ��� Ms. Theron could be a silent-movie heroine despite the noise that surrounds her ��� and on Junkie XL��s superb full-throated score. When it wants to crack jokes the movie reaches for quick profane sight gags or elaborate feats of Newtonian improbability." post-apocalyptic landscapes zombie-ridden or not are perennial popular tourist destinations for 21st-century moviegoers and couch potatoes. ���Mad Max: Fury Road�� is like a visit to a World Heritage site. Some of us ��� old enough to remember when nuclear Armageddon had not yet given way to climate change as the main source of existential anxiety ��� harbor a special fondness for the young Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky the grieving aggrieved former cop who motored across the Australian desert in ���Mad Max �� ���The Road Warrior�� and ���Beyond Thunderdome.��" the wide-open spaces and the kinetic ground-level movement mark ���Fury Road�� as a western and the filmmakers pay tribute to such masters of the genre as John Ford Budd Boetticher and not least Chuck Jones whose Road Runner cartoons are models of ingenuity and rigor."

At any second you expect him to vomit up his bilious rage but he resists." ���Good Kill�� is a blunt outspoken critique of remote-control warfare which is transforming the ugly reality of battlefield carnage into a video game whose casualties are pixels on a screen. The killing is real and yet it isn��t. The title is the congratulatory jargon following an explosion that wipes out a terrorist cell or a Taliban hide-out in Afghanistan Pakistan or Yemen." although highly informative lends ���Good Kill�� a heavy-handed didacticism that undercuts the still shocking vision of the direction of modern warfare. Increasingly it is a video game played by grown-ups who describe their dirty work in techno-speak that obscures what they are actually doing.

And if this is what musical comedy looks like on film today that��s O.K. too: the music is catchy and the jokes connect even when they��re easy. You can tell this is a sequel by the occasionally frantic mood and a sense of scale that feels a little off sometimes. ���Pitch Perfect�� was a charming campus comedy with humor that was naughty and sweet and had a sharp sense of the pop-culture moment. Its success has allowed (or perhaps forced) this installment to be bigger louder and wilder with new sometimes redundant characters celebrity cameos ��� Snoop Dogg! Jake Tapper! The Green Bay Packers! ��� and artificially elevated dramatic stakes. Some of the underdog appeal is gone but a victory lap can be its own kind of fun and more is not necessarily something to complain about especially when what there is more of is Fat Amy." this installment has improbable inspired musical numbers and frequent occasions when everyone else wisely stands back and lets Ms. Wilson riff gesticulate and manage to be utterly crude and impossibly graceful at the same time as if she were the solution to a complicated math problem involving Divine Dame Edna and Doris Day.

The glory of ���Pitch Perfect�� is that it��s devoted above all to the friendship and shared ambition of young women and that it finds plenty of room within that premise for raunchiness ridiculousness and warmth. The casual busyness of the plots does not distract from the essence of the movie which is the pleasure and occasional stress of hanging out with like-minded girlfriends as you ease your way toward adulthood.

Saint Laurent��s other companions and enablers include de la Falaise (L�a Seydoux) and the tall blond model Betty Catroux (Aymeline Valade). Hanging out with them has its pleasures its appalling moments and also its tiresome and confusing stretches. Mr. Bonello��s rigorous indifference to the usual matters of plot is admirable but it can sometimes test a viewer��s patience. His films shown in a recently concluded retrospective at the Film Society of Lincoln Center are held together more by color sensuality and atmosphere than by narrative or psychology. You could call them superficial but only in the sense that Oscar Wilde might have understood the word: The surfaces are rich complex and saturated with meaning. And this aesthetic here as in earlier features like ���The Pornographer�� and ���House of Pleasures �� can be suffocating as well as seductive." and into the business meetings where his brand-extension strategies were hatched.

YSL��s commitment to elegance was all-consuming and also represented a kind of transcendental consumerism. His life or at least this movie��s idea of it was both sumptuous and empty hedonistic and sad. He was a creator and even more a collector of attractive people intense experiences and beautiful things. To visit him in old age surrounded by servants memories occasional hallucinations and abundant objets d��art is to sit with a pharaoh in a tomb furnished for the afterlife. You��re not sure if you��ve witnessed a tragedy in the guise of a fashion show or the reverse." intoxicating decidedly decadent feeling but ���Saint Laurent�� is more than merely seductive. In dispensing with the usual plodding routines of the biopic Mr. Bonello offers a perspective on his subject ��� played in his prime by the epicene hollow-cheeked Gaspard Ulliel ��� that is at once intimate and detached. Beginning at a low moment in 1974 flashing back to the glory days of 1967 and later jumping ahead to Saint Laurent��s final years (when he��s played by Helmut Berger) the film is a compulsively detailed swirl of moods and impressions intent on capturing the contradictions of the man and his times. Observations of Saint Laurent at work and in love give way to panoramic intricate surveys of the world of commerce and culture in which he suffered and flourished." though is his absolute aesthetic confidence. He knows what is beautiful and he believes correctly that the rest of the world will eventually see things his way. His fanatical at times dictatorial will ensures that outcome. Mr. Ulliel��s Saint Laurent endures pain ��� and brings pain to others ��� but he never experiences a moment of doubt. He smokes draws drinks and watches the unfolding of history through his signature oversized glasses conveying a haunting quietly charismatic mixture of sensitivity and coldness. YSL as he is often called is equally capable of casual aristocratic cruelty and earthy spontaneous tenderness and when you study his face it can be hard to distinguish boredom from rapture." its episodic structure and the gorgeousness of its production design. Though their respective heroes could hardly be more different as physical or temperamental types both movies confront the challenge of depicting an original creative spirit at work and the paradoxical inability of one visual form to do justice to another. Though its products can be displayed artistic talent is invisible: There is no way for Mr. Ulliel (or Timothy Spall in ���Mr. Turner��) to dramatize the inner workings of genius or for Mr. Leigh or Mr. Bonello to show their work from the inside out. The sketches and dresses that Saint Laurent produces are beautiful of course but we can��t quite see where they came from." often on drugs and frequently out of their (also beautiful) clothes." Bertrand Bonello��s ���Saint Laurent�� beckons with the promise of an inside look at the hectic and mysterious world of fashion.

He��s a showboat if every so often more of a steamroller capable of flattening everyone and everything in his way. Yet he is also adept at conveying emotional and psychological fragility and there are some nice moments here when you see Dan as confused by his feelings for Oliver as a crushed-out 12-year-old which the filmmakers smartly don��t try to explain. Instead they show you what Dan sees and in the process upend the old formulation (often attributed to Raymond Chandler about James Bond) that while men want to be the handsome hero it��s only the women who want to be with him." as you see in an amusing Walter Mitty-like fantasy that landing Oliver will turn him into the conquering reunion hero. The writer-directors Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogel don��t make Dan a full-blown fantasist and crucially unlike Mitty Dan isn��t victimized by one of those classic pecking hens. His issues are largely of his own grandiose design but also fairly picayune. He��s carved out his own version of the American dream and appears happily married with a supportive wife Stacey (Kathryn Hahn) and two children as well as contentedly employed. (Jeffrey Tambor plays his boss.) It��s perfectly ordinary if also not enough for Dan who with can-do resolve flies to Los Angeles where he finds Oliver. There over several days and feverish nights they bond big time including in bed." ���The D Train�� stars Jack Black as Dan Landsman an outwardly ordinary Joe who��s helping to plan his 20th high school reunion. His testy dealings with the other reunion committee members suggest that he was as unpopular in high school as he is now.

When he sees one of the school��s former golden boys Oliver Lawless (a nimble perfect James Marsden) in a television commercial Dan decides to try to persuade him to come to the reunion." a situation more typically found in seriously unfunny prison movies. The 2009 indie movie ���Humpday �� a sendup of the genre circled the issue with two straight male friends who decide to make a pornographic movie with each other only to keep their penises in lockdown. That��s invariably the case in the typical bromances of course which feature delineated straight guys who engage in stereotypically even hyperbolically coded male behavior: They play air guitar drink to excess become involved in street altercations and so forth. One of the best ���I Love You Man �� even mimics the classic heterosexual romantic coupling: Boy meets boy; boy loses boy; boy gets boy kind of." sexual desire skitters at the edge of the story quivering like a man-child in a cathouse. The dudes in these movies tend to observe a ritualistic narrative proximity (they get close but not too close) that��s echoed in the physical protocols of the typical bro-hug. In these familiar ceremonial interactions the bros lean in toward each other for some upper-body contact even as they simultaneously maintain scrupulous observable genital distance. Once contact is made the bro-huggers exchange two or three hearty back slaps and then uncouple. In the comedy ���The D Train �� there��s no such retreat ��� only sweet sweaty surrender." a skipping sometimes thudding heart and some careful lighting ���The D Train�� takes the bromance to its logical conclusion. Even so it plays it sweet rather than tough including narratively and there are instances ��� as in a close-up of Dan his face knotted up in jealousy as he watches Oliver across a dance floor ��� when you see hints of a more dangerous less comfortable movie. ���The D Train�� acknowledges there can be more to all the usual sharing caring and relentless joking than the reproduction of male power but it isn��t going to upturn the status quo. The truth is that it��s pretty straight including in its revelation that sometimes when a guy says ���I love you man �� he really really means it."

Just describing the film is equivalent to listing the many ways it could have gone wrong. To build a comedy around the predicament of a mentally ill main character is to risk either gross insensitivity or a maudlin romanticism that is just as offensive. To take up the subject of subprime television is to court banality and bad faith. But ���Welcome to Me �� while not perfect is the opposite of a disaster. By turns touching amusing and genuinely disturbing it defies expectations and easy categorization forgoing obvious laughs and cheap emotional payoffs in favor of something much odder and more interesting." who embraces Alice��s outlandish notions and cross-wired emotions with compassion and integrity. As a sketch-comedy performer and a supporting player in movies like ���Date Night�� and ���Anchorman 2 �� Ms. Wiig has proved herself to be a resourceful and disciplined goofball. She is also a subtle and serious actress a fact that has manifested itself in very different ways in ���Bridesmaids �� ���Hateship Loveship�� and the Sundance favorite ���The Diary of a Teenage Girl �� opening in August." however distracted or derisive they offer therapy. The spirit-affirming gobbledygook that Alice spouts is not all that different from what is dispensed by her saner real-life counterparts who collect rather than pay out millions of dollars for the chance to share their wisdom with the rest of us. But like them she provides what the people on the other side of the screen really want ��� a human face a flicker of recognition a bit of company in our misery." you may experience similar confusion. Ms. Piven favors bright colors and tonal understatement creating a fascinating occasionally dizzying discrepancy between what the movie looks as if it��s doing and what it��s actually doing. At times it seems as if the director herself isn��t quite sure but more often she succeeds in controlling the ambiguity. Outrageous and improbable situations ��� like the news conference at which Alice accepts her lottery winnings ��� are presented matter-of-factly. Jokes are whispered or implied rather than telegraphed and punched up. Are we even supposed to be laughing?" a California woman ��� divorced unemployed coping with borderline personality disorder off her medication ��� who financed it with money she won in the state lottery. Alice is the program��s guiding creative spirit and also its star so the content reflects her interests: low-���carbohydrant�� cooking swan figurines the neutering of dogs re-enacted episodes of childhood humiliation and above all herself. She is both unstable and self-absorbed and though she has spent years studying the broadcast work of Oprah Winfrey on VHS Alice��s on-air gestures and intonations can be as awkward as her self-help pronouncements are bizarre. From the start ���Welcome to Me �� shot in front of a sparse audience in the studios of a struggling infomercial outfit seems to be headed for disaster." �� though it may at times look like a case study in quirk is really the portrait of an artist. Alice��s pain like everyone else��s is ordinary and specific. Her way of experiencing it is what defines her condition as a disorder and without minimizing or making light of pathology the film suggest that it can also be a source of meaning and not only for Alice. The brothers who own the studio ��� Gabe (Wes Bentley) a sensitive infomercial host and Rich (James Marsden) a sunny practical businessman ��� come to appreciate what she does even as they are frequently alarmed by her on-air behavior. So does the producer (Joan Cusack) who knows effective television when she sees it." �� Ms. Wiig is to some extent having it both ways using her natural silliness to draw us into a complicated psychological reality. In the studio audience for a demonstration of the power of algae-based smoothies ��� her first foray into television ��� Alice stares into the camera with unnerving directness looking like a freshly plucked owl. In private and in public she says wildly inappropriate things in a glassy self-satisfied monotone. Once her own show is underway she veers between studied Oprahesque radiance and tearful hysteria. Audience members (including a curious graduate student played by Thomas Mann) don��t know whether they��re witnessing sly performance art or a slow-motion trainwreck. They may giggle or cringe but they can��t look away." but the point of Ms. Wiig��s performance is not to hold her up to ridicule. It��s to make sense of her suffering and find the logic in her experience of herself and the world around her. The people in Alice��s life ��� including the producers and crew members who cash her checks and help realize her peculiar media vision ��� don��t treat her like a freak or an object of pity. She has a best friend (Linda Cardellini) and an ex-husband (Alan Tudyk) who care about her and a therapist (Tim Robbins) who does his best to help her. All of them try to map the fluid boundaries of her personality. Is she potentially dangerous to herself and others ��� or merely eccentric? Is she a sad oddball or a kind of genius?"

the men are tramping through the desert where step by step over one and then another crest they walk and periodically speak sharing meals and assorted dangers. With the director of photography Guillaume Deffontaines Mr. Oelhoffen conveys the striking multicolored glories of this rough landscape with all its sun-shot gradations of red and brown without descending into picture-postcard banality. (The movie was shot in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.) Many of the movie��s most effective scenes involve the men just walking through this extraordinary landscape the warring splendor and harshness of their surroundings ��� equally inviting and foreboding ��� as seemingly at odds as the attraction-repulsion that initially defines Daru and Mohamed��s relationship." �� Viggo Mortensen his sharply planed face weathered and solemn plays a man who looks as if he were quarried right out of the hard red-rock earth. He plays Daru a teacher who imparts the names of French rivers to eager Algerian children in a small white schoolhouse that��s nestled in a valley and ringed by jagged desert mountains. There��s something haunted about this wildly beautiful place with its thirsty ground and sparse vegetation though only partly because the story takes place in 1954 the year the fight for Algerian independence ignited." a gendarme Balducci (Vincent Martin) rides up on horseback to Daru��s schoolhouse with an Arab prisoner Mohamed (Reda Kateb) on foot. Balducci explains that the prisoner who��s never named in the Camus story has cut the throat of a cousin (���like a sheep��) and now Daru needs to take Mohamed to another town for some French justice and certain death. Daru refuses but when Balducci rides off the teacher is left with Mohamed and a quandary. After giving Mohamed dinner and a bed and after a restive night with a gun by his side Daru wakes to tell Mohamed that he can leave of his own accord. This seems as if it should be an easy call but Daru��s assumptions about free will don��t pan out. Mohamed refuses to flee." ���Far From Men�� is shored up with increasingly personalized conversations between Daru and Mohamed that explain the men their lives and times. At one point they come across a small detachment of Algerian guerrillas that includes Slimane (Djemel Barek) a former army compatriot of Daru��s and which for a short eventful interlude swallows the travelers up. Mr. Oelhoffen sometimes explains too much but his work with the actors is precise and delicate. Both Mr. Kateb and Mr. Mortensen who deliver their dialogue in Arabic and French (Mr. Mortensen also speaks a little Spanish) are generous performers and they share the screen easily. They��re playing nomads from separate histories and cultures who in their radical isolation turn out to be right at home." ���Far From Men�� takes its inspiration from an Albert Camus short story that was first published in his collection ���Exile and the Kingdom�� (1957). The movie is considerably more sentimental than the Camus which is as arid as its stark milieu and absent a ray of hope. The French writer-director David Oelhoffen fills in some of the narrative��s meaningful blanks with extra characters back histories low-key action scenes and a central relationship that feels by turns true and like wishful thinking. Camus sets the movie��s initial course but Mr. Oelhoffen resolutely steers it home with political context historical hindsight an unambiguous moral imperative and a pair of well-matched performances; put another way he makes the story his own."

Her Bathsheba is brisk and practical frank and friendly and a little impatient with the trio of suitors who admire her moxie even as they compete for the honor of suppressing it." Ms. Mulligan smirks sighs and sniffles Mr. Schoenaerts smolders Mr. Sheen scowls and Mr. Sturridge enjoys his mustache. They are all fun to watch though only Mr. Schoenaerts seems interested in testing the deeper currents of longing shame and pride that course beneath the surface. The most obvious thing to say about ���Far From the Madding Crowd�� is also the most bizarre given the source material. It��s buoyant pleasant and easygoing. That��s a recommendation of sorts and also an expression of disappointment." smirks sexy swordplay." one of them may be but he��s also the only one who appeals to Bathsheba��s less rational side. All three however are satellites orbiting the planet of her will which makes ���Far From the Madding Crowd�� feel like an unusually fresh and surprising romantic comedy. That��s not quite what Hardy or the filmmakers (David Nicholls wrote the script) intended: The story calls for two fatal gunshots and two more tragic and untimely deaths and the musical score (by Craig Armstrong) swells with melodramatic portent. But for all that ��� and for the requisite lingering over landscapes and livestock; the scenes of peasant heartiness and genteel reserve; the frocks and hats and Victorian facial hair ��� there is some fun to be had on this carefully decorated merry-go-round." they are talking about a woman. When they talk to her she often responds like one of the women in Mallory Ortberg��s hilariously captioned online surveys of Western art history who generally have better things to do than listen to men. When Gabriel Oak a farmer played with understated but unmistakable virility by Matthias Schoenaerts proposes to Bathsheba shortly after they have exchanged glances over a rustic fence she brusquely refuses." and her mistakes and spells of indecision are engaging without feeling terribly consequential. The mood of the film is less Hardy-esque than vaguely Hardy-ish. He rooted his chronicles of desire and its thwarting in a closely observed world of agricultural labor and ancient custom an earthiness conveyed here by the occasional shot of a toad or a snail and a few bouts of hearty off-key singing. Hardy��s interest in the operations of accident and caprice ��� in the ���purblind Doomsters�� who governed human fate ��� is reduced to a few plot points. A feckless dog chases a flock of sheep over a cliff. A bride goes to the wrong church on her wedding day. It all feels a little flimsy." that��s because she��s an acknowledged feminist foremother of the ���Hunger Games�� heroine ��� is faced with a series of complicated choices. Really though her predicament is simple: She wants to live on her own terms in a society where a woman��s freedom is tightly circumscribed by custom and expectation. As she tries to figure out what she wants to do and who she wants to be the world keeps pushing her to answer a different question: Which man will she marry?"

which helps a bit with both its rhythm and scale making it less of a monotonous special-effects blowout. Repeatedly Mr. Whedon injects something alive into the mix be it a woman��s fingers tenderly caressing a computer-generated wrist or children leaping into a father��s embrace. This assertion of flesh-and-blood vulnerability extends to several narrative points including a nod at the military industrial complex that is almost touchingly pointless given how much of this movie has been dedicated to ensuring obliterating violence looks cool. Even the villainous alien Ultron playfully voiced with mellifluous menace by James Spader philosophically chews the cud about humankind." another superhero spectacular ��� these are the days (and nights) of our moviegoing lives. The one under review today Marvel��s ���Avengers: Age of Ultron �� isn��t half-bad largely because of its director Joss Whedon. Here��s a guess: Some viewers will love it others will hate it and still others will yawn at its very existence. None of this matters because the most relevant thing about a movie like this is that its quality is almost entirely irrelevant. It was created to crush the box office entertainment media and audience resistance and mission you know already accomplished. In an age of lock-step entertainment pushback isn��t just immaterial; it is also suspect." especially from those of us who didn��t grow up worshiping at the altar of Stan Lee et al. or don��t watch movies based on brand affiliation. (Guilty!) It��s a good question whether the big studios�� dependence on comic books is hurting American mainstream cinema and whether they can figure out how to survive without suckling at Marvel��s great multiplatform teat. For a Marvel agnostic like me the single most interesting thing about ���Age of Ultron�� is that you can sense that Mr. Whedon having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first ���Avengers �� has now struggled mightily touchingly to invest this behemoth with some life." it can be hard to keep track of who��s doing what to whom and especially why. In story terms the movie ��� Mr. Whedon wrote ���Age of Ultron�� as well as directed ��� is outlandishly overpacked taking place on multiple fronts against various foes both terrestrial and galactic. Mr. Whedon opens with one of those Bond-style blowouts that��s so old-fashioned it even includes a Nazi-type villain Strucker whom the German actor Thomas Kretschmann plays all too briefly with a sneer and a monocle. Strucker evokes the continental cads �� la Erich von Stroheim and is meant to be a Mengele type whose work has produced a special set of twins: the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson)." what are they good for?) in his efforts to personalize the material while dutifully hitting all the genre notes. This ���Avengers�� doesn��t always pop the way that the first one sometimes did partly because its villain isn��t as memorable despite Mr. Spader��s silky threat. And as is often the case in these comic-book movies most of the fights are interminable and fatiguing though Mr. Whedon does fold in moments of beauty including when the image slows down with each Avenger centered in the frame both together and individually. This centering crystallizes the dynamic that is paramount to the Avengers story and also suggests the behind-the-scenes push-and-pull battle that Mr. Whedon has waged over two movies." hauling the enormous weight of the entire Marvel enterprise along with it only to routinely work itself into a frenzy of action and then (shades of the Buffyverse) chill out with scenes of relaxed camaraderie challenging romance and domestic intimacy. A lot of effort has been expended so that the Hulk can make like a big baby with tantrum issues tossing cars and whatnot around like toys including in a disastrously protracted street brawl that stops the movie dead. Once the character reverts to ordinary form as Bruce Banner though Mr. Ruffalo lifts his every scene as does Ms. Johansson even if she doesn��t have much to do but strut in her form-fitting costume and exchange meaningful looks with a romantic foil." of course including the billionaire egoist Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); the straightedge hero Captain America (Chris Evans); the E.T. Viking with the hammer and hair Thor (Chris Hemsworth); the token chick Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); some dude with arrows Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner); and that computer-assisted leviathan the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Rounding out the A-listers is Samuel L. Jackson who as Nick Fury brings a beautiful bald skull along with an Old Testament vibe and a black leather coat straight out of Shaft��s closet. Mr. Jackson has a nine-movie deal with Marvel; he has two more to go." Ms. Olsen and Mr. Taylor-Johnson are appealing attractive performers who usually show up in independent productions that probably cost less to make than this one��s craft-services bill. Their newness to this world distinguishes them when the screen becomes too crowded; so do the intensity of their contrapuntal performances and the pathos of their characters�� back story as refugees turned lab rats. Mr. Whedon is a sensitive director of actors as he showed for years while shepherding ���Buffy the Vampire Slayer.�� His characters banter and quip like screwball loons while parading their cultural literacy (here someone name-drops Eugene O��Neill) but these are linguistic fig leaves for men and women who feel and hurt deeply."

though the main continuities are stylistic. Mr. Gout favors restless camerawork and syncopated editing which is both engaging and somewhat superficial. And not every panel in the triptych is equally persuasive. The 2010 kidnapping of a wealthy businessman whose wife (Dolores Heredia) uncovers his secrets as she tries to save his life feels a bit thin. The relationship in 2006 between a kidnapping victim (Carlos Bardem) and one of his young captors (Kristyan Ferrer) teeters on the edge of sentimentality." but it mines that crisis for memorable images and dramatic scenes. And while Mr. Gout seems pessimistic about his country he is not entirely cynical about human nature or for that matter about movies." with the soccer taking place in South Korea and Japan the protagonist is Lupe (Tenoch Huerta) a young ambitious cop who insists on believing in right and wrong. He��s a hothead and a bit of a bully but his devotion to the memory of the great peasant revolutionary Emiliano Zapata whose photograph hangs from his rearview mirror identifies Lupe as an idealist and a patriot. He is also a new father and the vulnerability that family brings is a thread that connects his story with the others." �� the debut feature from Everardo Gout a Mexican filmmaker with a background in music videos and television commercials weaves together three stories of violence and corruption in Mexico City. Braided narratives are a way for directors both to show off their chops and to illuminate social issues and complex themes. Mr. Gout combines a slick kinetic style with a somber ethical sense. His movie is flashy and entertaining but also earnestly concerned with the collapse of trust and integrity at every level of society." the three plot lines take place during successive World Cups in 2002 2006 and 2010. At the center of each is a kidnapping which produces opportunities for clever sleight-of-hand editing. Mr. Gout and his tremendously talented cinematographer Luis David Sansans (whose credits include Alfonso Cuar�_n��s ���Y Tu Mama Tambien�� and Baz Luhrmann��s ���Romeo+Juliet��) use different color schemes and aspect ratios to signal where we are in time. The music (by Nick Cave and Atticus Ross among others) also changes and soccer fans will be able to identify which high-stakes match is distracting the attention of various criminals police officers and ordinary citizens." or between the authorities and the outlaws. ���People think we��re referees �� a police commander says to one of his underlings. ���But we��re players.

Ms. Kloss wears all white; Ms. Apfel her customary bold palette muted wears blue socks with white polka dots tee-ready green slacks and a dusky rose coat a large white bow tied around her neck. The bow makes her look like a gift which in a way she is. As you discover she would prefer you look at the bow than try to untie it to see what lies beneath. You get the bullet-point versions of her life both in talking-head interviews and while she��s on the somewhat slow but persistent run: She was born in Queens in 1921 and married a charmer named Carl Apfel with whom she ran a textile company and engaged in extreme globe-trotting. They never had children; they had each other. They also had the obvious means to collect an astonishment of luxury items and cut-rate stuff some of which she wears some of which she lives with like the oversized replica of the RCA dog plush toys statuary ornate vases and gilt mirrors." Architectural Digest described Ms. Apfel��s Park Avenue apartment as looking ���a little as if the Collyer brothers had moved in with Madame de Pompadour.�� That��s a clever bit of journalistic acid but the documentary paints a vividly contrary picture. A radical individualist Ms. Apfel embodies a profoundly alternative reality and another kind of truth one that may be threatening to some.

In some documentaries the director prefers to stay out of sight and perhaps out of mind. Here though Mr. Maysles pops up again both on camera and as an out-of-frame presence that Ms. Apfel addresses. These moments pierce the heart because he��s now gone and because you sense that this portrait of a glorious rebel is also and unmistakably a self-portrait." including one apartment on Park Avenue and another in Palm Beach.

His malaise is broken by a weird piece of news: An Oregon man named Christian Longo has been arrested and charged with murdering his wife and three children. While on the lam in Mexico he pretended to be Michael Finkel a writer for The New York Times. Alerted to this imposture by a reporter (Ethan Suplee) the real Michael Finkel arranges to meet Longo and they begin a wary friendship that is also a psychological cat-and-mouse game."

an actor making his directing debut tends to soften edges. The movie opens with a whoosh on Alex an environmental lawyer who has become careless about handing off her family life to her husband George (Mr. Messina) including the care of their 10-year-old son Dakota (Skylar Gaertner) and of her father Roger (Don Johnson). You see the exasperation in George��s face before Alex does so it��s not especially surprising when he announces that he��s leaving. Much like the runaway wife in ���Kramer vs. Kramer �� George needs to figure things out which shocks Alex and forces her like Dustin Hoffman��s Kramer to learn how to juggle her personal life and her professional commitments though without the upper-middle-class income and antifeminist finger-wagging." but the filmmakers know enough about human beings to know she doesn��t have to. Instead she makes mistakes works long hours and serves her family takeout pizza for dinner without regret or recrimination. Meanwhile Roger a former television star goes out on an audition and discovers his mortality when he lands a supporting role rather than a lead. The filmmakers (the script was written by Jessica Goldberg Katie Nehra and Justin Shilton) initially seem to have erred badly by making ���The Cherry Orchard�� the framework for Roger��s turmoil both onstage and off but Mr. Johnson��s sensitive lived-in performance with its layers of vanity and humiliation makes the best argument for bringing in Chekhov." ���Alex of Venice�� takes place against that messy Los Angeles backdrop of beachside attractions and boardwalk crowds millionaire mansions and homeless encampments known as Venice. That��s the neighborhood in which the heroine Alex (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) grew up and that with her family she still calls home. She may not notice the carnival anymore but the director Chris Messina takes time to gently point out some of the more picturesque sites like the Venice sign that serves as a gateway to the Pacific and the arched walkways that Orson Welles immortalized in ���Touch of Evil.��" particularly in respect to its title character. The narrative routinely splits to separately track Roger and Dakota who nurses his feelings of abandonment while hanging with Alex��s adult sister Lily (Ms. Nehra) a tamed rebel returned to the fold. These scenes dilute Alex��s story and the family dynamics they gesture to are blandly familiar: Roger is a stoner Lily a former druggie Alex an unhealthy overachiever. In American movies it sometimes seems every unhappy family is unhappy in exactly the same dysfunctional way. What��s missing here is the sting of revelation something less comforting than the story��s melodramatic turns and more worthy of Ms. Winstead��s performance which is as natural as life." a developer whom Alex battles in court only to bed; Jennifer Jason Leigh as Maureen Alex��s prickly arrogantly crusading boss; and a parade of performers whose faces may be more familiar than their names among them Reg E. Cathey Timm Sharp Matthew Del Negro Will McCormack and Beth Grant. This lineup can be somewhat distracting (you may find yourself trying to place each actor with a television show) and it��s hard not to wonder if the movie was cast by scrolling through someone��s iPhone contacts. At the same time these familiar faces feel welcoming and make the movie seem like a shared effort as if Mr. Messina had rounded up his friends for a production as modest and sincere as the one Roger appears in onstage."

In a narrative move that further obscures the interesting if clouded truth Mr. Caranfil also frames his version with a needless contrivance. In ���Closer �� the robbers pull off the heist using a diversionary tactic: They pretend that they��re shooting a film. With overblown gestures they fire up a movie camera and overplay to the audience of ordinary looky-loos creating a pantomime that will be echoed when after their arrest they must recreate the crime in the official propaganda picture." including one also called ���Reconstruction�� (2001) by Irene Lusztig whose grandmother Monica Alfandary Sevianu and grandmother��s husband Igor Sevianu were part of the bank-robbing gang. It isn��t widely available but ���The Great Communist Bank Robbery�� (2004) by Alexandru Solomon a smart bitingly sardonic chronicle of the same incident can be rented online.

In 1959 a group of formerly true-believing Romanian Communists all Jewish did the unthinkable when they robbed a branch of the state (and only) bank.

Apparently believing that the state might go easier on them if they cooperated the robbers played along all the way through the show-trial end." Mr. Caranfil divides ���Closer�� into chapters each meant to throw new light on the tale. Vera Farmiga stars as Alice who not long after the story opens returns to Bucharest. She soon takes up with her old comrades including her unhappily married ex-lover Max (Mark Strong). (Max seems to be a conflation of Mr. Sevianu and another conspirator Alexandru Ioanid; the crew was nicknamed theIoanid Gang.) Mr. Strong and Ms. Farmiga can be predictably cartoonishly fun like a Romanian Boris and Natasha but even they can��t always make clunky dialogue sing or navigate slippery tone shifts without showing the strain and neither is especially convincing here whether playing it heavy or light.

Since there are as a matter of precept and policy no murderers in the workers�� paradise his crimes are officially designated accidents or blamed on scapegoats. Leo and Raisa exiled to a remote factory town must simultaneously evade the long reach of Vasili��s treachery and try to track down the killer." and a heavy burden on viewers who must swallow potato-size lumps of exposition swimming in a visual gravy of browns grays and muddy tans. It��s only when people start punching and stabbing one another that Mr. Espinosa ��� whose earlier films include the action thrillers ���Safe House�� and ���Easy Money�� ��� finds any kind of rhythm. Some of the actors are able to locate psychological nuances amid the big murky themes and heavy-handed plot twists. The relationship between Leo and Raisa is the film��s only zone of real human complexity and in a few quiet moments the two of them muster poignant duets of desire confusion and fear." �� directed by Daniel Espinosa from a screenplay by Richard Price is an English-language movie set in Russia which means that it is above all a festival of accents.

Here he lands heavily on the aitches and contracts the words ���it is�� into the letter Z. ���Zimpossible �� he says. ���Zdifficult.��" and as such functioned as a kind of origin story establishing the tangled roots and ambiguous temperament of a hard-boiled tenderhearted Soviet detective.

To be accused of disloyalty is to be guilty which means disgrace torture and death. Leo takes part in the brutality but he seems more scrupulous than others trying to spare the life of a suspected traitor (Jason Clarke) and reacting with outrage when a fellow officer summarily executes a peasant couple.

They are bored restless antisocial and vaguely in search of some kind of intensity." �� ���The River�� and ���The Hole�� ��� Mr. Tsai would enrich this stark sad vision of life in Taipei and refine his melancholy absurdist style. Although ���Rebels�� tells a slighter somewhat more conventional story than those movies it could hardly be mistaken for anyone else��s work.

They seem very much stuck in their world but because that world is the creation of a wildly original artist coming into his own it also feels alive with possibility." there are performers who would become fixtures of this director��s imaginative universe. Chief among them is Lee Kang-sheng a slender nearly silent man with a Keatonesque deadpan who has appeared in all 10 of Mr. Tsai��s features so far. Here he plays Hsiao-kang an unhappy student living with his parents (Lu Yi-ching and Miao Tien) and halfheartedly attending classes. Friendless and celibate he develops an obsession with Ah-tze (Chen Chao-jung a petty criminal who specializes in robbing pay phones and vending machines)." ���Rebels of the Neon God�� marks the start of one of modern cinema��s great careers. This film which in spite of a worldwide cult following has never received a proper United States release was the first feature directed by Tsai Ming-liang whose subsequent work would establish him alongside slightly older contemporaries like Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang as a leading figure in the Taiwanese New Wave of the 1990s.

If as Wittgenstein also writes ���the human body is the best picture of the human soul�� then Caleb��s body when he��s with Ava is an entire Instagram feed of male surrender from his widening eyes to slackening mouth.

She still trembles perhaps uncontrollably but now every twitch feels like a calibrated almost electrified response to Maria to the star��s consuming demands her careless love and thoughtless cruelty. One of the great pleasures of the movie is how Mr. Assayas plays with and then subverts the ugly dynamic familiar from movies like ���All About Eve �� with its vainglorious older woman destined for a fall done in by vanity and the conniving younger female upstart. The three women in ���Clouds of Sils Maria�� love talk and move move move sharing lives trading roles and performing parts. The lives they lead are messy and indeterminate but each woman��s life belongs to her." �� Valentine enters talking before shifting into action to manage Maria��s calendar and life. The details of these initial conversations fade but what lingers is how Mr. Assayas introduces Ms. Stewart standing unsteadily in a swaying train corridor with her hair softly framing her face and how Valentine expertly handles both the phones and Maria. Valentine has said nothing about herself and yet the scene has said plenty. Mr. Assayas occasionally gives his characters cascades of dialogue some of which push the story forward. Part of his genius though is how he marshals ordinary everyday words and gestures to fill in a character so that it feels as if the story is organically emerging from them and their world from desires and actions instead of any ideas about screenwriting." crisscrossing trajectories and increasingly heated warring motivations. Maria and Valentine travel to Wilhelm��s home in Sils Maria an area in the Swiss Alps known for its haunting cloud formations and where in 1881 the idea of eternal recurrence came to Nietzsche ���6 000 feet beyond man and time �� as he wrote. As Maria confronts the agony of Wilhelm��s death she feels the sting of her own mortality: a hot theater director Klaus (Lars Eidinger) wants to cast Maria in a new production of ���Maloja Snake �� this time as the older woman. He wants a young American blockbuster superstar Jo-Ann (Chlo� Grace Moretz very good) for the part of the younger woman the same role that catapulted Maria to fame." if not eternally Mr. Assayas returns to Maria. (The genesis of the movie traces back to ���Rendez-Vous �� a 1980s film that Mr. Assayas helped write in which Ms. Binoche played a young actress on the verge of fame.) Grudgingly Maria agrees to play the older woman in ���Maloja Snake �� a role that time in a sense has already thrust on her. Her preparations are bruising sometimes brutal and as she combatively at times harshly runs lines with Valentine Maria tramples the divide between life and performance." an excitingly restless director who moves among genres as fluidly as he changes up a scene��s mood likes to cram his films with enough events and actions for three ordinary movies. Some occur in a narratively heightened key ��� in thrillers like ���Carlos�� and ���Boarding Gate �� which feature gunplay and other violent outbursts ��� but much of what happens in his films takes place in a recognizable reality. The people are invariably beautiful the settings sometimes rarefied and the stakes occasionally extraordinary but never at the expense of Mr. Assayas��s allegiance to real deeply lived and felt life. That��s one reason he doesn��t build scenes but prefers to plunge you into events and conversations in progress. Reality doesn��t need a big send-off." ���Clouds�� opens with Valentine juggling phones on a commuter train. (Her superpowers include multitasking.) She and Maria are on their way to Zurich where Maria is to accept an award on behalf of an old mentor Wilhelm Melchior a theater genius and filmmaker in the Ingmar Bergman vein. En route Maria learns that Wilhelm has died and instead of a celebration she has to prepare for his memorial. She grieves while Valentine flutters about more butterfly than moth balancing Maria��s professional commitments with her personal needs and whims. Two decades earlier Wilhelm had secured Maria��s fortune by casting her in his play and film ���Maloja Snake �� as a young woman who becomes romantically catastrophically involved with an older woman." this one for language and skinny-dipping." ���Clouds of Sils Maria�� lights from subject to subject among them female friendships female rivalries tabloid notoriety the loss of privacy in the Internet age high culture versus low and of course cinema itself." the personal assistant to a French movie star Maria Enders played with blissfully aggressive hauteur by Juliette Binoche. Ms. Stewart easily holds both her own and the screen alongside Ms. Binoche delivering the kind of emotionally translucent performance that first got her noticed as the girl with the guitar in ���Into the Wild �� the one with the messy hair and bleeding heart on her sleeve. In the years since Ms. Stewart hasn��t always been asked to do more than look lovesick or imperiled and she��s picked up some bad habits along the way. (She fidgets like a sugar-jonesing toddler.) Yet despite too many inferior roles she retains an unalloyed thin-skinned naturalism that scrapes away at every false note. The writer-director Olivier Assayas hasn��t rediscovered her; she��s always been there." blockbusters are where talent and ambition go to die. For others like Kristen Stewart the star of that international juggernaut called the ���Twilight Saga �� big movies can be a good place to hide out while they��re raking it in. In the superb French film ���Clouds of Sils Maria �� Ms. Stewart plays an ordinary American abroad a new-age pop-savvy Daisy Miller who with expressive intelligence that few blockbusters allow makes a passionate argument for the kinds of movies the actress herself is best known for. Ms. Stewart has rightly won a lot of attention for her performance (the French film industry rewarded her with its highest honor a C�sar) but it would be a mistake to think of this as some sort of career rescue mission."

Dior whose 1947 New Look created some of the most enduring iconography of modern femininity is invoked as a friendly ghost haunting the workshops and showrooms of his maison de couture and as a benevolent patriarch devoted above all to the elegance of women.

Among the familiar faces are Mr. Maadi who played the husband in the Iranian art-house hit ���A Separation��; the Iranian-born actress Shohreh Aghdashloo; the New Zealand utility player Cliff Curtis; and the Korean-Japanese actor Tsuyoshi Ihara. Years ago the largely disparaging descriptor Euro-pudding emerged for European co-productions that crossed borders in terms of their financing if not necessarily their stories. By contrast global goulash like ���Last Knights�� ��� which was shot in the Czech Republic ��� is located in only one domain: that realm known as the international marketplace." �� a medieval-esque potboiler features a lineup of pedigreed jaw-clenchers who can swing swords without letting their paychecks show too much. Among the nimblest is Clive Owen who makes fast and furious with a sword in between uttering lines like ���I��m Commander Raiden of the Seventh Rank�� and ���I follow you my lord.�� That would be his liege and ours Morgan Freeman whose job here is to gild the mold as in: ���During the long dark period of the great wars an elite class of soldier rose from battle. Their unbreakable code was simple.��" Kazuaki Kiriya establishes his action-flick bona fides soon after the movie opens with some deep-forest slicing dicing clanging and cape-and-blade twirling. Form shares the stage with function both in this inaugural match and in later fights where the graceful arc of a cape the metallic scrape of an unsheathing sword the stillness of a face and even the pauses register as meaningfully as palpable hits. When Raiden freezes catlike after a whirling dervish move the moment invokes those used in karate demonstrations. They look cool but they also resonate. Or as George Balanchine once wrote: ���A pause an interruption is never empty space between indicated sounds. It is not just nothing. It acts as a carrying agent from the last sound to the next one.��" the story is just the stuff that holds together the weapon fetishism and the battles the costumes and the poses. With Bartok gone Raiden and his no-longer merry men struggle to adapt to their new normal even as their foes the emperor (Payman Maadi) and his villainous adviser Geza Mott (Aksel Hennie) continue their reign of terror which mainly seems to involve robbing the restless nobility. Geza Mott as befits his wringing hands and headbanging moniker also slaps around his wife Hannah (Park Si-Yeon). There��s plenty of spousal abuse in this man��s world and even Raiden ends up spending his days and nights quaffing booze or stumbling through the streets allowing his wife Naomi (Ayelet Zurer) to suffer in dim unflattering lighting." ���Last Knights�� proves as square and blandly manly as an old ���Prince Valiant�� comic strip. Mr. Owen��s hairdo and the faint smile edging his lips are more fetching than anything about Val and the movie��s violence is more explicit than in most vintage comics but ���Knights�� also works by combining narrative simplicity with moral certitude and appealing graphics. When Raiden and his men go into battle their jet-black horses look as if they��ve been obsessively-compulsively dyed to match their riders�� leathery accouterments. Yet what those riders do isn��t all that different from what happens in a ���Prince Valiant�� panel: ���The men put their gear in order and carefully sharpen their swords.�� As is often the case in genre cinema everything is different and exactly the same." honor vengeance cool-looking fights and the fantasy of the good death the kind that ends with blood garnishing a scene rather than curdling the mood. The movie��s lineage can be traced to perennial favorites like the story of 47 Ronin in which loyal vassals avenge their master; its reason for being doubtless owes something to ���Game of Thrones �� with its tribal warfare Shakespearean overtones and international appeal. Much as in 47 Ronin Mr. Freeman��s character Lord Bartok insults a member of the corrupt court and pays a disastrous price leading to various downwardly spiraling calamities: His palace is torched his land seized and his people turned out. Commander Raiden meanwhile goes on an exceedingly long bender."

which are nice but find the filmmakers easing up on the more complicated truths of Ruskin and Gray��s life and times especially in respect to the famous friendships that some 19th-century British men maintained with girls. In a wonderful blog post on Renaissance art the female body and pubic hair a British scholar Jill Burke chimes in on the discussion of Ruskin��s marriage writing that as a Victorian immersed in the Italian Renaissance art he might have expected women to be completely hairless. (She calls the Renaissance ���a golden age of depilation.��) The reasons behind the depilated woman were as varied then as they are today and predictably partly turned on the control of the female body which of course tends to be less furred and frightening when very young." his first and (unsurprisingly) only wife. History and Mike Leigh��s movie ���Mr. Turner�� remember Ruskin as an advocate for the painter J.M.W. Turner. Others remember Ruskin as the Victorian who on his wedding night was so appalled by the sight of his wife��s pubic hair that he refused to sleep with her (ever). What really turned Ruskin off? Who knows? Certainly not the makers of ���Effie Gray �� a serviceable British costume drama about the pathetic affair." the director Richard Laxton working from a script by Emma Thompson hustles the newlyweds off to London where they move in with his parents.

(Ms. Thompson as Lady Eastlake pops in now and again for a laugh and to dispense advice.)" the movie omits much of the story��s most interesting material to create something that��s been smoothly denatured. Here that means rather too politely suggesting that John (Greg Wise) rejected Effie (Dakota Fanning) because her naked body discreetly seen here and as fuzzed as a peach didn��t conform to his image of the girl he��d fallen in love with. The real Ruskin was 21 when he met Gray who was the 12-year-old daughter of family friends.

It��s a lamentable if not especially engrossing story part wronged-woman narrative part marital horror movie.

Effie smiles frolics dances and pants a bit including on a Venice trip during which Ruskin worked on ���The Stones of Venice �� only to quickly fade. She perks up with the introduction of John Everett Millais (Tom Sturridge) a Pre-Raphaelite who painted a dubiously heroic plein-air portrait of Ruskin."

When the young Maria (Tatiana Maslany) flees Vienna her parents�� final words ���remember us �� strike a tone of mawkish nobility that characterize the heavy-handedness of the screenplay and of the score by Martin Phipps and Hans Zimmer." the artwork Gustav Klimt��s ���Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I �� is a regal painting encrusted with gold leaf of Maria��s beloved Aunt Adele. Many consider it the Mona Lisa of Austria and to some Austrians keeping this magnificent work in the country is a matter of national honor." in whose belongings are records of her unsuccessful effort to recover five Klimt paintings displayed in the Belvedere in Vienna. Maria engages Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) grandson of the composer Arnold Schoenberg and an inexperienced young lawyer who persuades her to accompany him to Vienna a city to which she vowed she would never return after fleeing the Nazis." ���Woman in Gold�� turns a complicated story with many debatable questions about artistic provenance and ownership into a standard historical drama about good guys versus bad guys." whose character Maria Altmann is a proud elderly Austrian Jewish woman who fled the Nazi scourge to settle in California. Reawakened to the past by the death of her sister at whose 1998 funeral she is first observed Maria wages a protracted legal battle to regain possession of a priceless canvas stolen from her family by the Nazis 60 years earlier." as embodied by Ms. Mirren she is a woman of enormous cultural refinement and as formidable a personage in her way as Ms. Mirren��s sometime stage and screen alter ego Queen Elizabeth II. Assuming a clipped Viennese accent and maintaining a rigid posture she exudes a keen-eyed patrician composure." portrayed as cold arrogant enemies of truth and justice. Their legal battle to keep the work in Austria is subtly used as evidence of a residual nostalgia for the Nazi occupation tinged with anti-Semitism although none is voiced outright. The good guys are Holocaust refugees and their American descendants who take Maria��s case all the way to the United States Supreme Court." this Hollywood lightweight given glasses to make him look serious delivers a bland colorless performance. As Randy��s deepening involvement in the case becomes an obsession causing him to quit his job and devote everything to Maria��s cause Mr. Reynolds works hard and even breaks down in tears but his performance is shallow and unconvincing." or the ethical and moral issues involved compelling beyond the obvious guessing game of who will win." ���Woman in Gold�� smugly and shamelessly pushes familiar buttons." the paperwork concerning the painting��s history is withheld from them.

this evisceration foreshadows other violence to come. It��s a tough but critical scene because while Mr. Mundruczo has a sharp sense of humor evident especially in his use of horror-movie tropes ���White God�� isn��t a comedy or a Disney-like anthropomorphized romp. The camera gets down on all fours metaphorically and shares Hagen��s point of view showing you what the world looks like around our knees. Yet Hagen isn��t a wee human in a fuzzy costume; he doesn��t have a digital mouth talk to other animals or share his thoughts. The radicalness of the movie is that it asserts he doesn��t need to be like a person for you to be on his side. He is a dog and that��s all he needs to be." which culminates with an ugly fight that��s a frenzy of slamming bodies ominous growls and bloodied muzzles isn��t for the weak of heart. But these scenes represent movie sleight of hand at its finest as do the sequences of Hagen making like Jason Bourne while escaping pound workers hurtling down alleys darting around corners racing across terraces and even bursting through an apartment window into the lap of its understandably surprised inhabitant. In time Hagen stops running from his oppressors and instead ��� flanked by a glorious mutt army in a series of soaring astonishingly choreographed scenes ��� heads straight at the humans who have done him and his friends lethally morally wrong. After years of domination nature is biting back." �� a Hungarian revenge fantasy that��s like nothing you��ve seen on screen before. The story is as simple as a parable a campfire story a children��s book: A faithful animal separated from its loving owner endures suffers struggles and resists while trying to transcend its brutal fate. The director Kornel Mundruczo has said that he was partly inspired by J. M. Coetzee��s devastating novel ���Disgrace �� but the movie also invokes haunting animal classics like ���Black Beauty�� and ���The Call of the Wild.��" the four-legged hero of ���The Call of the Wild �� the dog protagonist in ���White God �� Hagen ��� played with full-bodied expressivity by the canine siblings Bodie and Luke ��� is a mixed breed. For his closest companion a solemn-faced 13-year-old named Lili (Zsofia Psotta) Hagen��s ancestry isn��t an issue but it is one for those state officials who tax dogs that aren��t purebreds. Lili��s father Daniel (Sandor Zsoter) who has custody of her for a few months has no interest in paying the tax or keeping the dog which is how Hagen ends up on the streets of Budapest initially alone then in the hands of a cruel master and then with a pack." the story divides too forming parallel narrative tracks. For much of the movie Mr. Mundruczo switches back and forth between Hagen and Lili as they look for each other underlining their similarities friendships close calls minor triumphs and anxious searching long runs down unfriendly streets. Hagen finds a pal (a scene-nibbling Jack Russell terrier named Marlene); Lili flirts with a boy who plays in her orchestra. Both Hagen and Lili are soon forced on a tight leash. She has to deal with her tyrannical father and a similarly patriarchal orchestra leader; Hagen meanwhile faces far worse after he��s sold by a vagrant first to a dealer (Mr. Mundruczo) and then a vicious trainer (Szabolcs Thuroczy)." panting tail-wagging glory is the big payoff in ���White God �� which features 250 or so dogs that were trained for the movie not a computer-generated pooch among them. Mr. Mundruczo has said that his movie was shot using the American film industry��s guidelines on the use of animal performers. That��s not entirely reassuring given the abuses that nonetheless occur during productions as a ghastly 2013 expos� in The Hollywood Reporter affirmed. Still viewers concerned about the welfare of the dogs especially in some of the tougher scenes should pay close attention to the cunning editing and camera angles as well as all those happy tails. Mr. Mundruczo has also produced smartly a reassuring behind-the-scenes video that��s available on YouTube." Mr. Mundruczo works the setup like a burlesque fan dancer teasing out the reveal bit by bit. He introduces Lili and Hagen together while they��re sharing the frame and playing a quietly portentous game of tug-of-war. Lili��s mother has gone off on a lengthy trip with her husband leaving the girl with her father who Lili demonstrably doesn��t much like. Mr. Mundruczo at first seems to share Lili��s aversion; at the very least he knows how to stack the story decks: Daniel isn��t just a dour unsmiling sad sack he��s also a fallen man who now works as a slaughterhouse inspector. You first meet him in an antiseptic room in which after workers gut and skin a dead cow he plunges a gauge in the innards declaring it fit for consumption." period. Those who don��t care how we treat animals may wonder what any of this has to do with a movie much less a review. Yet it is our bonds with other animals our obligations and our sympathies that make ���White God�� more than a gimmick movie. These are questions Mr. Mundruczo suggests that also extend to creatures that we godlike designate as meat not pets to borrow a formulation from Michael Moore��s ���Roger & Me.�� What are nonhuman animals to us? In Mr. Coetzee��s ���Disgrace �� a character who helps out at a shelter in which animals are euthanized says of dogs ���They do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things.�� In ���White God �� the dogs respond with their own kill policy." mornings and nights."

who is 45 does not pretend to be neutral and neither can I. ���While We��re Young�� opens with some darkly funny lines from Henrik Ibsen��s ���The Master Builder�� that show the hostility directed against the rising generation by the middle-aged to be very old news. Of course it is. How could we not be terrified and resentful? Their evolutionary job is to correct our mistakes to ignore our hard-won wisdom and to replace us whether or not we��re ready. They need less sleep and look better in their clothes and they��re so damn confident. Don��t get me started." not all of which can be ascribed to the usual narcissism of small differences. But first it��s important to acknowledge the acuity of Mr. Baumbach��s insight and his overall generosity of spirit. Generosity as it happens is the film��s key ethical principle. It��s the quality Josh most admires in Jamie and Darby and finds most lacking in himself. A documentary filmmaker who has spent most of a decade working on a sprawling incomplete project on ���power in America �� Josh marvels at his young friends�� apparent indifference to success at their open eager embrace of experience. He and Cornelia seem crabbed and cautious by comparison." Mr. Baumbach��s movie mostly brings a light touch and a forgiving gloss to its own self-consciousness. It is not afraid to be implicated in the confusion ��� in the self-involvement the anxiety the pettiness ��� it depicts. But there are also areas where it feels soft and compromised where the subtlety and clarity of Mr. Baumbach��s vision seem to desert him. The last section while it has a few fine farcical moments goes astray in trying to recapture flagging comic momentum and slides toward chaotic Greenbergian hostility. The inevitable complications in what had seemed to be a perfect friendship are not quite credible and the movie seems uncertain how to handle them." as in Judd Apatow��s somewhat similar ���This Is 40 �� is a guy thing. Men make movies. Women make ice cream or babies or help the men make their movies. The frustrations and identity crises that plague poor Josh ��� his rivalries with older and younger men his failure to live up to his early promise ��� are large and central. Whatever analogous problems Cornelia might have are circumscribed and peripheral and exist entirely in terms of her relationships with the men in her life." Mr. Baumbach is as usual a piquant observer of the manners and morals of the various demographic subsets of the white urban lower-upper-middle class. He is without peer among screenwriters as a composer of incisive non-punchline-driven comic dialogue and unrivaled among directors as a choreographer of fraught social encounters." played by Ben Stiller unleashes a tirade against a roomful of 20-year-olds whom he believes have been ruined by sensitive parenting among other things. (If you haven��t seen ���Greenberg �� we need to talk). ���While We��re Young �� Mr. Baumbach��s buoyant vinegar-laced new film is not a sequel ��� Mr. Stiller plays Josh a reasonably pleasant and well-adjusted guy for a Ben Stiller character in a Noah Baumbach picture ��� but it does pick up where the earlier movie left off in its exploration of the fraught relations between ascendant millennials and the rapidly aging members of Generation X." Josh and Cornelia neglect their old friends Fletcher (Adam Horovitz) and Marina (Maria Dizzia) who seem preoccupied with their new baby. Josh and Cornelia who decided not to have children after a series of miscarriages seem to have more in common with Jamie and Darby in any case. And also more to learn from them. These youngsters take an impressive interest in the past: They collect vinyl records VHS cassettes and manual typewriters and have a healthy ability to take or leave the latest technology. When no one can remember the word ���marzipan �� Josh pulls out his phone to Google it but Jamie and Darby stop him. ���Let��s just not know �� Jamie says." Paul and Mary and the Beastie Boys represented however subliminally in the same movie. If you were born during the Johnson or Nixon administrations and drifted from a progressive nursery school toward a liberal arts college that��s pretty much the story of your life right there." like many a child of his era obsessed with the finer points of pop-cultural taste. ���I remember when this song was just supposed to be bad �� Josh marvels when Jamie with apparent sincerity plays ���Eye of the Tiger�� for inspiration. Josh��s relationship with music and movies is based on sorting and rating whereas his new bro seems to take everything as equivalent without regard for categories like high and low or even good and bad. Josh and Jamie are equally objects of gentle satire (which sharpens as the movie goes on) but Mr. Baumbach also honors both of their sensibilities compulsively combining and repurposing the detritus of the recent past in the hope that some kind of meaning will emerge from it." however ���While We��re Young�� presents a sun-dappled vision of intergenerational harmony. Josh and his wife Cornelia (Naomi Watts) befriend Jamie and Darby a 25-year-old married couple who open a portal into a new cool parallel universe. It��s still New York but it��s totally different. There are ���street beach�� parties and ayahuasca ceremonies artisanal restaurants and thrift shops. Cornelia accompanies Darby (Amanda Seyfried) to a hip-hop exercise class. Josh goes bike riding with Jamie (Adam Driver) and buys himself a narrow-brimmed fedora." and struggles against them. Fletcher is a stay-at-home dad; Darby experiences a feminist awakening though nobody quite calls it that. But in spite of those moments and in spite of the happy good-humored companionship that exists between Josh and Cornelia Mr. Baumbach never quite grants the women in the movie equal access to their own lives or to the audience��s empathy. His title turns out to be doubly ironic: We��re not really young and we��re not really ���we.��" Josh in particular. He finds himself squeezed on one side by Jamie an aspiring documentarian guilelessly seeking a mentor and on the other by Cornelia��s father Leslie (Charles Grodin) a beloved old lion of the heroic cin�ma v�rit� era. Leslie��s name is invoked alongside those of Frederick Wiseman D. A. Pennebaker and the Maysles brothers and he stands for an honest rugged socially conscious brand of filmmaking that both Jamie and Josh admire. But while Leslie could believe in an ideal of truth in cinema and Jamie can just go out and shoot great stuff Josh finds himself tangled up in overthinking and qualification. Pitching his unfinished masterpiece to a hedge-fund friend of Jamie��s Josh is unable to say exactly what it��s about. It��s about so many complicated things including ���the very possibility of making this film.��" Jamie and Leslie are all vividly drawn and intricately shaded characters but Darby and Cornelia in spite of Ms. Seyfried��s quickness and Ms. Watts��s incomparable emotional range are blurry and sketchy in comparison. They have a lesser share in the story."

That is pretty much what the makers of ���Get Hard�� have done (Etan Cohen is the director. He Ian Roberts and Jay Martel are the screenwriters. All white guys in case you were wondering.) It��s more or less how a lot of R-rated big-studio comedies are put together these days with or without racial themes. Let a couple of funny guys do a lot of funny things and don��t worry too much about whether it makes sense." a superrich financier named James faces 10 years in the penitentiary after being convicted of fraud and embezzlement and he��s terrified of sexual assault. He hires Darnell the upwardly striving carwash owner played by Mr. Hart to teach him how to protect himself. Why? Because James assumes that as a black man Darnell must know all about prison. Let us pause here to marvel at the challenge the filmmakers have set for themselves which is to say at the many different ways this conceit isn��t funny. It��s hard to know where to begin." who is also James��s boss; John Mayer as himself. The only one who makes much of an impression is the rapper T.I. who takes what might be the most egregiously stereotyped role in the whole movie and infuses it with sly menace and charismatic wit. There is a plot of sorts ��� James who insists he��s innocent will need to find out who set him up ��� but it��s pretty much abandoned until the very end when the need for an action sequence or two asserts itself and the rape jokes have run low." you can��t watch ���Get Hard�� without laughing a few times whether you like it or not. What makes you laugh will of course depend on your taste or lack thereof. It may be the sight of Mr. Ferrell��s buttocks. (Did I mention that he��s white?) It may be his goofy swear words. It may be when Mr. Hart impersonates the whole population of a prison exercise yard. Or when Mr. Ferrell bench-presses him. (Mr. Ferrell it should be noted is fairly tall. Mr. Hart is quite short.)" as usual is jumpy and silly maniacally mugging his way through every scene. Mr. Ferrell as usual is lumbering and silly using his big body and his adaptable voice to explore new varieties of embarrassment. Neither is exactly bad though both have been better doing other things." of course but even among comedians there��s some reluctance to mine sexual assault for easy laughs. The exception seems to be when men in prison are involved but why should that be the case? (No need to answer.)"

(Ms. Bier apparently spent more than a year in postproduction trying to get the movie in shape.) That said all the deep-fried performances including from Rhys Ifans as a weird mountain man with a gun strongly suggest that no amount of post magic could have saved this picture from its makers." the story takes place in the North Carolina mountains and finds George and Serena first battling those who want to turn the area into a park and then fighting each other. Blood spills and drama erupts but none of it registers. What does register is that this is another recent bid from a Danish director to recreate not simply the American past but also a Hollywood-style version of that past. In ���The Salvation �� the Danish director Kristian Levring reimagines the old American West in a movie shot in South Africa; here Ms. Bier has tried to recreate 1920s Appalachia in the Czech Republic.

This proved false: ���Michel Houellebecq has not been captured by Al Qaeda �� one  news outfit  assured anxious readers. Enter the French filmmaker Guillaume Nicloux who casually blurring nonfiction with fiction and shooting in remarkably ugly digital has created a distinct insistently light version of that disappearance. This lightness is especially strange as is the movie��s comedy which together make a dissonant counterpart to the now-familiar deadly kidnappings by the likes of the Islamic State." ashen-faced man on screen stands on a corner in Paris alone and seemingly ignored.

A typically vulgar caricature of him was on the cover of the magazine Charlie Hebdo on Jan. 7 the day that two jihadists entered its Paris offices and set about slaughtering 12 people." ���The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq�� had its premiere at the 2014 Berlin International Film Festival a year before the Charlie Hebdo killings. There��s no direct connection between the movie and the murders but both are part of that contested terrain known as Michel Houellebecq. By this I mean less the real Mr. Houellebecq (whoever he is) than that site in which writerly production meets intellectual validation or condemnation vociferous public debate and political denunciation. It is this site this authorial marker that is presumably on view in ���The Kidnapping �� a divertingly eccentric often comically absurd movie about a novelist also named Michel Houellebecq who finds something like happiness after being abducted." he becomes intimately humorously and fraternally acquainted with his French-speaking kidnappers ��� played by Luc Schwarz Mathieu Nicourt and Maxime Lefran�_ois all called by their real first names ��� who pour him drinks ask about his writing process and demonstrate their various bodybuilding and fight skills. Michel proves to be a demanding kidnapping victim: he asks for wine food cigarettes a lighter books.

That detachment its cause and consequence forms the shrouded heart of ���Please Be Normal �� a tiny piercing study of dawning desperation that��s all the more remarkable for being virtually silent." the actors remain miraculously natural as their director (who also photographed the film with Ori Lahav) creates a curiously magnetic drama from restraint and repression. Stabs of eerie music (by the duo Stars of the Lid) punctuate the narrative most effectively in a dreamy sequence that follows Victor and a grieving young woman (Dana Eskelson) on a nighttime journey. Their connection is transient but profound just one of the film��s several kinds of love. But happiness? That��s something else entirely." the writer and director Haik Kocharian lets us see the prison that love can become when responsibility smothers dreams.

Too many movies hurtle forward on fast editing and breathless plotting and too much of life goes by in a blur. The characters in four of Mr. Alonso��s features ��� ���La Libertad �� ���Los Muertos �� ���Liverpool�� and now ���Jauja�� ��� undertake difficult journeys at least partly on foot across hostile terrain. Following them through long takes and static shots accompanied by abundant silence and sparse dialogue and music the viewer feels the weight of time. This can be uncomfortable but the risk of tedium can deliver a special kind of intensity a slowing of the metabolism and an awakening of the senses." a Danish engineer played by Viggo Mortensen the first actual movie star to appear in an Alonso film (and also one of the composers of the film��s curiously and also purposely anachronistic-sounding score). Sometime in the late 19th century somewhere along the rocky and desolate Patagonian coast Dinesen and his 15-year-old daughter Ingeborg (Viilbjork Mallin Agger) are camped out with a small group of soldiers and surveyors. A middle-aged officer expresses polite but unmistakably predatory interest in the girl who instead runs off with his assistant a skinny dreamboat named Corto. Her father sets off in pursuit." his search follows the trail of a classic western ��� of ���The Searchers �� to be precise. We assume that it will end either in a reunion or in disaster and as Dinesen encounters bloody corpses and bloodcurdling screams the second possibility seems much more likely. But Mr. Alonso it turns out has an entirely different destination in mind." I doubt if I could. Suffice it to say that this filmmaker who has until now specialized in earthbound emphatically linear stories that nonetheless resonate with intimations of spiritual mystery has gone in a new direction toward a more overtly poetic and frankly anti-realist kind of cinema. ���Jauja�� is more stylized and shapely than his earlier films. The rounded-off corners of the almost-square frames evoke early movies and antique photographs and there is wit and mischief in the way Mr. Alonso plays with the relationship between what we see what we don��t see and what we expect to see." yet nobody experiences true solitude. Whenever characters might think themselves alone and unobserved the camera will pivot to reveal that someone else is nearby watching or scheming or just taking up space. The wilderness a barren and silent entity in ���La Libertad�� and ���Liverpool �� now feels haunted full of inscrutable meanings and intentions. These may be signs of a cosmic or metaphysical presence or they may be figments of Dinesen��s increasingly desperate and fevered imagination. It��s possible that we end up in his mind or his dreams or in a hitherto uncharted dimension or maybe the film guides us to the magical city of Jauja. It may take a few more trips to figure it out."

As the Wachowskis proved in the ���Matrix�� trilogy and as copycat moviemakers have been affirming since jackboot fashion and heroic hyperviolence go together in movies like guns and ammunition. And while guns may be a hot-button topic off-screen they remain blandly par for the action-movie course including in PG-13-rated movies like this. So much so that ���Insurgent �� based on the young-adult series by Veronica Roth features not one but two scenes in which a nominal villain is executed point blank with a bullet to the head by a nominally righteous character." whose to-the-screen-born poise and controlled nervous energy make a jolting contrast to the pouts and droopiness of some of the other secondary male leads. Mr. Teller plays Peter a Dauntless member who turns up every so often to help push the story forward and throw some barbs at Tris. Mr. James has obvious charms but together he and Ms. Woodley work like a palliative on the movie. A somewhat appealingly diffident presence Ms. Woodley has a talent for carving out a little pocket of intimacy on-screen which is why she��s good at bringing you into a character��s head space. She too has appeal though it��s clear that even after two movies she isn��t as much driving this franchise as catching a ride." Tris still isn��t all that engaging even if she remains an effective empathy generator despite her occasional need to shoot to kill. She feels bad about that mind you shedding tears now and then amid the mayhem and exegesis. In broad strokes Tris is the classic odd girl out and compulsory self-reliant heroine who leads with her brains instead of her inevitable good looks the protagonist who struggles to feel she belongs even though she was born to lead. Sometimes she��s called Joan as in Arc; in ���The Hunger Games �� the obvious model for the ���Divergent�� book series she��s called Katniss Everdeen.

If you didn��t know that the first movie��s director Neil Burger had bowed out of the sequels you might not even notice the change in personnel. True Ms. Woodley looks more comfortable with her action-heroine duties than she did in ���Divergent �� though this may have more to do with her rising stardom than anything else including her new director. She looks at ease running and gunning now and also shows off some impressive upper-body strength along with some feeling. Like Mr. Schwentke she hits all the requisite marks in a story that like so many middle chapters feels distinctly interstitial." perhaps especially for readers struggling to find their own paths and selves amid the confusions of adolescence. Ms. Roth��s stated interest in psychology may partly account for why her factions evoke the five-factor model of personality a.k.a. the Big Five: agreeableness conscientiousness extraversion neuroticism and openness. Tris who is actually an outlier type called Divergent transcends these classifications which makes her a danger to power and assures her the widest possible audience appeal.

Their defensive competitive roughhousing suggests that their bonds are shallow; they act more like fraternity brothers than lifelong friends and they have few common interests. As they make their way downtown they pass an apartment they once shared in which a fire broke out and foam from an extinguisher caused damage leaving some hard feelings." but it feels like a slightly older male version of ���Girls.�� Because the costumes at that children��s birthday party have a pirate theme you are reminded of ���Peter Pan.�� The portrayal of rampaging screeching children at the picnic is a nightmarish premonition of their future as stressed-out parents unable to control the little savages they have spawned.

Over time though the kid grows meaner and the flicks grow harder faster too and you realize that they��re keeping time with the thudding of your heart (thump thump).

He��s set out to have you now steer clear of the lovely dark and deep woods too." unnerving fun watching their descent at least for a while. Making the most of the beautiful surroundings the camera sweeping over the quiet grandeur of the crystalline lake and dense forest Mr. MacDonald and his nimble-footed director of photography Christian Bielz make a convincing visual case for why Alex and Jenn (who has little camping experience) have made the trip. During the couple��s short canoe ride to the trailhead the pristine park looks vast yet inviting and as deceptively manageable as the boat itself. Once they hit the trail in earnest though that initial sense of expansiveness (and manageability) begins to disappear along with the friendly faces of other hikers. The forest begins to progressively close in around them like a hand ��� a giant furry clawed one." and so it is here. ���Backcountry�� includes a brief notice that it��s based on a true story and Mr. MacDonald has said he was partly inspired by an Ontario couple��s real-life wilderness nightmare. He teases out the exact nature of the attack with insinuating cracks and creaks a foreboding dead bird a lot of neck-swiveling double takes and a sly amusingly testy encounter with another hiker Brad (Eric Balfour). Something wicked this way comes ��� or maybe not. When the worst finally does arrive Mr. MacDonald trades in his timing and discretion to go full-bore gore gleefully painting the screen red with blood and guts in an ugly scene that proves yet again man really is the most dangerous animal." the snap of a twig ��� is all the more impressive given that it takes a while to warm up to the two souls he cuts loose in those woods. You first meet Jenn (a good Missy Peregrym) and Alex (Jeff Roop) en route to a backpacking trip in the Canadian wilds. They��re attractive if bland and it becomes clear when they check in with a ranger (Nicholas Campbell) terribly ill equipped for their adventure. They may have the gear including water purification (if not enough water!) but when Alex a self-professed park expert tells the ranger they don��t need a map the couple��s fate is as good as sealed." as countless Farrelly brothers chuckleheads show. Too many dumb decisions by a good-guy stiff like Alex a Dudley Do-Right whom Mr. MacDonald tries to make sympathetic tends to mean that a filmmaker hasn��t done the necessary hard work. In ���Wild �� when Cheryl Strayed sets off on her trek with too much gear and ill-fitting boots it makes sense for her personality and becomes part of her journey. By contrast Alex��s mistakes ��� and he makes several forehead-slapping doozies ��� don��t register as expressions of character but rather as specific narrative strategies because without a map or a compass (never mind G.P.S.) and nowhere near enough water he and Jenn have nowhere to go but down down down."

light look into the abyss ���Amour Fou�� takes as its inspiration a terrible bloodletting: In 1811 Kleist fired a bullet into the heart of a friend Henriette Vogel and then shot himself in the mouth. Vogel may have been terminally ill one of the few details about her that tends to make it into great-man accounts. Kleist seems to have held his own narrow views of her as suggested in a letter to his cousin Marie (who had declined his offer) writing of Vogel: ���She has grasped on a higher plane that my sadness was incurable and deeply rooted and therefore although she has enough means at hand to make me happy here on earth she will die with me.��" as in her earlier movies like ���Lourdes �� Ms. Hausner draws you in with the oddness of the material exacting compositions and the kind of narrative ellipses that force your engagement (and risk your irritation). She��s working within a recognizable art-film idiom but bending it to her own ends. The physically restrained at times borderline somnolent performances in ���Amour Fou�� will be familiar to habitu�s of European art cinema as if the characters were in the grip of some destabilizing ennui. Here the restrained physicality thematically serves as proof of the prison that Henriette will soon be liberated from by her suitor. It also works for the subtly escalating comedy that Ms. Hausner with finesse and fine timing sneaks into her story with dogs sidelong looks and deadpan." notably by turning her gaze and ours from the man who wrote of ���my sadness�� to the woman willing to ���die with me.�� Much of the movie centers on Henriette who before Heinrich seizes on her seems perfectly content being a wife and mother. With a maid D�_rte (Alissa Wilms) Henriette keeps house; serves her husband Friedrich (Stephan Grossmann); and cares for the couple��s only child Pauline (Paraschiva Dragus). It��s an orderly tastefully sterile and you soon sense palpably suffocating world with a place for everything and a thing for every place one that Ms. Hausner appears ��� from bedroom to dining table ��� to have mapped out using a compass and a straightedge." she receives great help from Mr. Friedel whose portrayal of Kleist ��� with his already-dead eyes hunched shoulders and uncomfortably stiff formality ��� can bring to mind a Beatrix Potter illustration of a gentleman toad. It may be an uncharitable creation more absurd than tragic but this isn��t a biographical study of the doomed poet and his times or anything that literary or high-minded. It is rather a teasingly dry gloss on the notion of romantic love and its costs. To that end it can be a strategically off-putting movie yet one that also steals under your skin scene by scene and through Ms. Schnoeink��s slowly revealing performance as an ill-fated heroine turned future biographical footnote. Her Henriette enters ���Amour Fou�� as much a mystery to herself as us only to figure it out a little too late." specifically a woman to die for and with him. He has both the weapons and the romantic bona fides having been modeled on none other than the poet and playwright Heinrich von Kleist who once wrote ���It was hell that gave me this half-talent of mine: Heaven grants a whole one or none at all.��" �� an eccentric coolly deadpan story of love including that of the self. Set in Germany in the early 19th century it tells of a middle-class woman Henriette (Birte Schnoeink) who to her great surprise catches the eye of an insistently gloomy young poet Heinrich (Christian Friedel)." like the big bouquet that nearly bursts out of one early shot partly and instructively obscuring Henriette from view. Of course the blooms are already dead and therefore more funerary than life-affirming which seems very much to be the point much like the beautiful flowers that ornament Douglas Sirk��s Hollywood melodramas. Ms. Hausner��s approach to her material is considerably more restrained than that of Mr. Sirk who deployed his Brechtian distancing devices in lushly emotional fantastically hyperbolic sob stories that simultaneously pulled you in. Ms. Hausner clearly wants to create some distance between her characters and the audience; she initially seems less interested in full-on seduction."

It��s not a universally loved story; in a review Norman Mailer wrote that Mr. Salinger ���disappoints because he is always practicing.�� That��s a dig and off the mark. Practice doesn��t always make perfect but as Mr. Bernstein shows practice struggle and running your fingers up and down the scales year after year is what we must do. As Seymour asks Buddy what will you be asked when you die? �������Were most of your stars out? Were you busy writing your heart out?����� Seymour assures Buddy ���If only you knew how easy it would be for you to say yes to both questions.��" if you gave up playing an instrument (oh let��s say the violin) you will surely regret that folly. Among the lessons musical and otherwise that Mr. Bernstein offers is that surrender isn��t an option. ���The struggle is what makes the art form �� he says. ���I had to go to war for my art form.�� Many of us may not have felt equipped for war when we were trying to coax grace beauty something from our sheet music but that��s scarcely the point.

Mr. Hawke incorporates a fair amount of interviews with Mr. Bernstein but much of the movie takes the form of dialogues including between the filmmaker and his subject a dynamic that over time begins to resemble some of the other teacher-student encounters in the movie. Some of these students are familiar others less so. (Among the guests is The New York Times critic Michael Kimmelman.) None dazzle as brightly as Mr. Bernstein whether he��s talking teaching or playing. That the three blur together is evident whether he��s alone at the piano teaching students in his cozily appointed one-room apartment or holding a master class." as is the sense that the terms are inseparable for him. Life for Mr. Bernstein began in Newark in 1927; music entered not long after. At 6 he begged his mother for a piano though music was entirely absent from his family��s home. He began teaching piano when he was 15 started winning prizes shortly thereafter studied with the likes of Clifford Curzon and in 1969 made his debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Bernstein played at the front in the Korean War and in concert halls afterward winning praise and admirers only to give up his public career when he was 50." ���Seymour: An Introduction�� doesn��t try to offer the final word on its subject Seymour Bernstein the pianist composer teacher philosopher and ultimate New Yorker. Instead in 81 transporting minutes this intimate big-hearted documentary draws you so completely into his world that you feel as if you know all there is to know even as questions linger. So effectively does it close the distance between you and Mr. Bernstein that afterward you may find yourself scanning the streets hoping to catch sight of him as if for an old friend." who directed and occasionally appears on camera provides a generous amount of biographical details about his subject while omitting others. Mr. Bernstein doesn��t seem terribly interested in oversharing. He sketches in his early years but doesn��t often voluntarily return to the subject of his family. Sometimes he is pulled back to it as when Mr. Hawke asks if it bothered Mr. Bernstein that his father said he had two daughters and a pianist. (Yes it did.) You can learn more facts from Mr. Bernstein��s website than from this movie and still more from his suggestively titled 2002 memoir ���Monsters and Angels: Surviving a Career in Music.�� There��s nothing about his love life in the movie no questions about partners or whether he longed for children."

What matters more are the consequences including the casual cruelty with which Posthumus gambles with his and Imogen��s love. The wager reaps various dividends plotwise and otherwise including the playfully silly sight of Iachimo sneaking into Imogen��s bedroom while she sleeps and taking cellphone selfies with her body." although Mr. Almereyda adeptly unkinks the complications. Set in the untrammeled boutique-free wilds of New York (standing in for ancient Britain) the story runs on two parallel tracks. One involves Cymbeline (Ed Harris) the overlord or rather drug kingpin of the Britons a motorcycle gang. He��s tough but he��s also burdened by a feckless fashion-forward queen (Milla Jovovich) who has encouraged him to withhold tribute to Rome. She has her reasons namely her son from a previous union Cloten (Anton Yelchin) whom she wants to wed to the king��s daughter Imogen (Dakota Johnson lovely). Imogen meanwhile has married Posthumus (Penn Badgley) a former favorite of the king who has little going for him beyond his looks and a skateboard he hasn��t mastered." his version of ���Cymbeline�� (which for a while was actually titled ���Anarchy��) reaffirms that Shakespeare can always survive every interpretive trick with or without choppers and chrome. As soon becomes evident in this appealing eccentric divertissement the loudest flashiest of contemporary appurtenances from blazing machine guns to gleaming leather jackets are inevitably outshone by Shakespeare��s words even in a lesser-known lesser-loved late play like this. And ���Cymbeline�� has not always felt the love as witnessed by Samuel Johnson��s spittled outrage at ���the folly of the fiction the absurdity of the conduct the confusion of the names and manners of different times and the impossibility of the events in any system of life.��" the machismo and the mayhem Mr. Almereyda is transparently more interested in Imogen than all the scheming warring men who surround her. Soon after Iachimo��s bedroom raid Imogen��s fate takes a dramatic turn. Aided by Posthumus��s servant Pisanio (John Leguizamo) she chops her hair ditches her shorts and goes on the run becoming one of Shakespeare��s undercover women by transforming into a man. In her journey she finds lost brothers waylaid honor and herself. The fate of a people hangs in the balance in Cymbeline��s contentious dealings with Rome.

the story of Cinderella is also that of mothers ��� dead cruel and magical ��� who loom over this quintessential dutiful daughter far more than any man. One mother abandons Cinderella leading the way for a second mother to torment her who in turn opens the door for a third mother to come to the rescue with a wave of her wand. The prince may eventually find and marry Cinderella but it��s a mother who truly saves her. It��s a strange matriarchal world after all if one still rived with complexities. Here the screenwriter Chris Weitz adds some dimensionality to the standard conception of the Stepmother (as she��s only known) mostly by referencing the dire prospects for a widow with two children and no income of her own." her friendly neighborhood mice know the score and give it song: ���Night and day it��s Cinderelly! ���Make the fire fix-a breakfast wash the dishes do the mopping and the sweeping and the dusting.�� They always keep her hopping!�� In Disney��s latest version directed by Kenneth Branagh the mice stick to squeaking and look about as real as most computer-generated rodents. And fascinatingly much remains the same including a fairy tale that opens with clear skies but soon plays the poor-little-girl blues before you-know-who comes along. ���Maleficent�� and its revisionism are so last year." pretty as a picture with flowing blond hair a flashing smile a fabulous gown ��� a bewitchingly blue number from the costume wizard Sandy Powell ��� and that go-good-girl triumphalism. First though here��s the once upon a time: ���Cinderella�� opens in an indeterminate past with long frocks horse-drawn carriages and no cellphones in one of those lavish soundstage countries. (The movie was partly shot in the Pinewood Studios in Britain.) There 10-year-old Ella (Eloise Webb) safely nests in a pocket paradise alongside her homemaker mother (Hayley Atwell) and merchant father (Ben Chaplin) a small menagerie and a clutch of smiling servants. This being a fairy tale heaven soon gives way to woe so the story can get down to business." bibbidi-bobbidi-boo and all that jazz. Helena Bonham Carter toddles in as the Fairy Godmother and Richard Madden (���Game of Thrones��) gallops in as the Prince. Mildly charming and orthodontically dazzling the Prince first sees Ella taking a very unmaidenly bareback horse ride a scene that conveys that she remains free despite the home-front misery. Try as the filmmakers might to obscure her victimization there��s no getting around that this Cinderella has to do time as the classic persecuted woman even if the Disney imperative means that she must also dust herself off go to the ball and waltz into a happy ending. As tabloids reality television countless novels and sometimes the movies suggest you cannot keep a good woman down even if it��s fun trying." eyes widening and narrowing and teeth all but gnashing plays the role at full Cruella de Vil tilt. It��s a divertingly oversize near-vaudevillian performance ornamented with frozen looks boogieing brows and rubber-band-like mouth contortions. Mr. Branagh��s ascension into big-budget studio directing largely remains a mystery and there��s little in ���Cinderella�� beyond its faces and gowns that captures the eye or the imagination. His one interesting directorial choice is to fold in different performance styles which tend to fall into exaggerated almost-burlesque mode or a more familiar naturalistic expressiveness. This suggests that at least in the case of the Stepmother (if not her nitwit daughters) cruelty sometimes may be more a mask than a question of being." why now? If you��re the Walt Disney Company the answer can only be: Why not? She may not be a princess (yet!) and the story may have been told innumerable times but there��s gold in those glass slippers no matter how many miles they have on them. The cinema pioneer Georges M�li��s told her story in 1899 perhaps for the first time on screen and she recently popped up in Disney��s live-action adaptation of Stephen Sondheim��s ���Into the Woods.�� Disney has further helped stoke the demand for this new movie with two direct-to-video sequels to its 1950 film ���Cinderella II: Dreams Do Come True�� (2002) and ���Cinderella III: A Twist in Time�� (2007)." this Stepmother can��t help but steal the show. Ms. Blanchett takes some of the credit (or blame) as does the visual design for the character which from her soign�e updos to a leopard-skin dressing gown suggests a 1940s femme fatale. There certainly is a touch of Joan Crawford��s Mildred Pierce to the Stepmother and her sob-worthy back story (as well as her blood-red lipstick and power shoulders). And when Ms. Blanchett��s pale face emerges from behind a hat the entrance evokes the likes of Jane Greer ���coming out of the sun�� in the noir ���Out of the Past�� so she can destroy Robert Mitchum. Even so the Stepmother isn��t really evil ��� she just proves from her smoky eyes to her enviable green frocks that bad always sizzles more than good." so pardon my spoiler: Ella��s mother dies after some discreet coughing time passes and Lily James takes over the role of the older Ella. A regular on the television series ���Downton Abbey �� Ms. James effortlessly holds the big screen less because of her beauty than the life that both animates and demystifies that beauty making it seem less other (even a touch aspirational) and her character feel approachable and likable. It��s smart casting because that likability and the smiles it solicits help take the edge off Cinderella��s victimization and because the minute Ella��s father brings home a new wife Ms. James becomes a wee planet in the orbit of a very bright star known as Cate Blanchett ��� the Stepmother of course."

uninvolving fictionalized take on the real 1983 snatching of Alfred Heineken chairman of the company bearing his family��s name. A few years ago the same story was turned into ���The Heineken Kidnapping �� a Dutch movie with Rutger Hauer in the title role which racked up some business in the Netherlands and is available on Amazon on demand." which plays out as a shopworn tale of greed stupidity and deserved comeuppance. This time Anthony Hopkins plays the big brew king who amid murky shadows and awkward camera angles is grabbed off an Amsterdam street with his chauffeur Ab Doderer (David Dencik) by a gang of idiots. These four are played by an international crew of familiar names ��� Jim Sturgess Sam Worthington Ryan Kwanten and an actual Dutch dude Mark van Eeuwen ��� who with Mr. Hopkins probably got this flick bankrolled." the actors playing the kidnappers speak in shades of accented English though Mr. Worthington as a hothead named Willem Holleeder doesn��t seem to be trying to master a Dutch inflection terribly hard or perhaps just gave up. He��s playing more a notion (he��s the criminal with daddy issues) than a realized character an under-conceptualization that you might think would have been evident in the script. The screenplay credited to William Brookfield covers the basic facts of the kidnapping and briefly and irritatingly suggests that the abductors were at least partly motivated by economic hard times. This dubious socio-economic rationalization evaporates the moment the four guns firing wildly rob a bank to finance the kidnapping." as does the follow-up which largely involves the sad-sack villains flailing about and looking quizzically at one another. Mr. Hopkins doesn��t have much to do but it can be amusing to see him upstage everyone else with sonorous murmurings and imperious demands for a robe and Chinese takeout. When the kidnappers leave the ransom letter in a copy machine the movie seems to be lurching into gang-who-can��t-shoot-straight burlesque. The filmmakers alas seem to think that they have something serious to say and that Mr. Sturgess��s doe eyes will reveal the heart beneath this mess. The basis for his character Cor van Hout apparently went on to become with the real Mr. Holleeder a criminal mastermind which given this movie seems like pure science fiction."

as is so much of ���Chappie�� despite the violence crenelated brows and choreographed grimaces. For all of Mr. Blomkamp��s attention to grim speculative fiction and its trappings (the despair the gadgets) he often seems more at ease when things are going right for his characters or when he��s lobbing a joke. Sometimes he uses comedy as a distraction or to soft-pedal an emotion or an idea. It��s funny when Chappie watches the cartoon ���He-Man and the Masters of the Universe �� because you see him learning but the scene also gestures to the idea that hyperbolic masculinity is absurd learned behavior. And when Yo-Landi reads a children��s book or chatters sweetly to Chappie something rather more surprising happens because Mr. Blomkamp has let real emotions creep in too." �� a science-fiction blood-spurter and would-be heart-warmer that wavers uncertainly between laughter and tears. Set in South Africa in the usual bummer future ��� yet again it��s man against man as well as machine ��� the movie imagines a scenario in which tin-can police march in lock step with their human analogues to roust the usual tattooed and dreadlocked gun-toting degenerates. All the aerial shots of the dangerously swarming and swelling multitudes suggest that such draconian tactics are necessary." and he��s still finding his way as a director; again and again as in the past he struggles with the material a performance an idea the tone or just some blocking. ���Chappie�� is more visibly modest and less narratively ambitious than his last movie ���Elysium �� which benefited greatly from Matt Damon��s emotionally anchoring star turn as an Everyman struggling among the human-made ruins. Scaling down has its drawbacks as some of the visible digital artifacts in ���Chappie�� make clear. Yet even at his shakiest Mr. Blomkamp holds your attention with stories about characters banding together to emerge from a hell not of their own making a liberation journey that just isn��t the same old same old when a director was born in South Africa." and Chappie ends up in the hands of a troika of misfit criminals who decide that a smart robot would make a useful accessory to go with their pink and yellow guns which look as finger-licking good as Valentine��s candy. The South African musicians Ninja (the guy) and Yo-Landi Visser (the woman) bring the cartoon charisma as the flashiest two thirds of this trio with the American actor Jose Pablo Cantillo as Yankie valiantly thumping along as the third wheel. A well-greased matched set Yo-Landi Visser and Ninja (the characters share the performers�� names) take to Chappie-rearing seriously and soon teach the robot how to talk shoot and stroll like a gangsta while he in turn takes jerky baby steps and calls them Mommy and Daddy." it��s no surprise that the robots with their matte gray cladding and rabbit ears swiveling heads and articulated limbs have been created with more attention to detail than the story. After the preliminaries a protagonist emerges in the person of Deon (Dev Patel) an engineer for the outfit that churns out the Scouts. His only colleagues who at that point seem vaguely sentient are his boss Michelle (Sigourney Weaver) and a teeth-gnashing foe Vincent (Hugh Jackman) who parades around with a gun on his belt. One night Deon takes a decommissioned robot home and after some Red Bull and energetic keyboard abuse solves the problem of artificial intelligence. Enter Chappie played with a singsong by Sharlto Copley Mr. Blomkamp��s favorite attraction." but he doesn��t engage with it (as say Steven Spielberg did in ���A.I.��) as much as desultorily kick it around. It��s as if he felt that he needed an excuse to trot out his robot as if one were ever needed. It��s no wonder his nods to earlier texts ��� from the different iterations of ���Frankenstein�� to ���RoboCop�� ��� register as little more than shorthand for ideas that have been worked out more fully elsewhere. In some movies allusions to other movies build on earlier thinking or at times become an index of authorial self-regard intended mostly to close the distance between the original and the copy. Here the allusions feel like the handiwork of someone who��s eager to make something cool and so borrows with promiscuous abandon." working with a script he wrote with his wife Terri Tatchell doesn��t engage with the question of whether a police state is necessary; he just goes with the paramilitary flow. And as an introductory flurry of news reports indicates law demands order. To help stem the murderous tide the authorities have deployed a force of armed robots called Scouts to serve as shields for their human brethren or to fire on the heavily fortified shouting masses. Mr. Blomkamp who directed the back-to-back science-fiction tales ���District 9�� and ���Elysium �� has a real feel for dystopia and he persuasively sets a chaotic scene partly by again shooting in the real Johannesburg."

So of course in the end he gets the girl (Diane Farr). Mr. Carolla finds roles for among others Jay Mohr David Alan Grier Howie Mandel and Larry Miller who does a particularly humiliating turn as Bruce��s vile agent." a comic who once had a hit television show but is now reduced to doing stand-up in small clubs and being bitter that fame often doesn��t last.

Mladen has been using the money meant for mortgage payments to rebuild the broken-down camper that blocks their front gate in the hopes of selling it for big money." ���The Lesson�� is a textbook work of neorealism at once a moral parable of contemporary life and a close examination of local circumstances. The influence of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne is evident in the film��s structure and themes as well as in the way the camera bumpily follows Nade as she hurries through her increasingly stressful days.

A loan shark is reasonable and businesslike at first but it��s not difficult to predict that there will be hidden costs to dealing with him. As Nade races against the clock ���The Lesson�� becomes an effectively suspenseful quasi thriller. The pursuit of the thief at school provides a pointed subplot and foreshadows the climactic twists in the story. But the tidiness of the narrative is also a limitation.

Donato (Wagner Moura) a lifeguard haunted by his first failed rescue smothers his feelings in mindless sex with the victim��s friend Konrad (Clemens Schick). And when Konrad returns to Germany Donato uncertainly tags along as baffled by his decision as we are." ���Futuro Beach�� has followed death with sex and the loss of a friend with the gain of a lover. None of these events feel particularly momentous however in a film that ravishes the eye but keeps the heart at arm��s length." ���Futuro Beach�� explores liberation and reinvention the tug of familiarity versus the allure of the foreign. Donato��s abandonment of an ailing mother and adoring younger brother (beautifully played as an adult by Jesuita Barbosa) is scrutinized not in dialogue but in long musically enhanced scenes of drinking dancing and picturesque soul-searching.

This story of a lonely middle-aged businessman whose involvement with a scrawny rent boy he meets at the Gare du Nord in Paris explores interlocking themes of sexuality immigration and power dynamics with a cleareyed sensitivity and refuses to demonize even its shadiest characters." Robin Campillo is a close associate of the French master Laurent Cantet and is credited as a screenwriter for Mr. Cantet��s films ���The Class�� and ���Heading South.�� Like those movies ���Eastern Boys�� explores the transactional nature of relationships with a hyperawareness of how social hierarchies and economic and class differences affect behavior.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/movies/review-in-71-young-green-and-behind-enemy-lines.html
�� an excitingly jumpy finely calibrated chase movie about a British soldier caught behind enemy lines the director Yann Demange goes from zero to 100 in the blink of an eye. The soldier is played by Jack O��Connell last seen being brutalized (in more ways than one) in ���Unbroken �� the Angelina Jolie biopic about Louis Zamperini. That movie proved a bad fit for Mr. O��Connell who never put down roots in the character an Olympian turned World War II captive because Ms. Jolie couldn��t or wouldn��t let him. By contrast Mr. O��Connell runs away with ������71 �� in which his character��s every emotional psychological and physical hurdle makes for kinetic cinema." Northern Ireland in a year that opened with the tarring and feathering of several men by the Irish Republican Army. By February a British soldier was dead as were a number of civilians and several riots had convulsed Belfast. It��s against this backdrop that Mr. O��Connell��s character Gary Hook arrives with a regiment of similarly inexperienced soldiers. Smoke pours from burning cars some strategically bookending streets like barricades. During the day children play among scattered bricks that they sometimes hurl at the soldiers (when they��re not lobbing bags of feces instead). At night the mazelike streets belong to the war and the running people British and Irish stoking the flames." but Mr. Demange moves so effortlessly and rapidly from these introductory interludes that you may not notice all the parts shifting into gear. He knows when to linger in the moment too as when Gary watches Darren at a home for children a place that you intuit the older brother knows inch by loveless inch." though you wonder if being parentless explains the seriousness of Gary��s gaze and his mournfulness. His immaturity and the military may explain his reserve but it��s also a good guess that his survival instincts were honed in that home." and at times it seems as if the movies were made for ready set go go go: Buster Keaton bolting in ���Seven Chances��; Cary Grant fleeing in ���North by Northwest��; Franka Potente racing in ���Run Lola Run.�� Mr. Demange makes his feature directing debut with ������71 �� but he already knows how to move bodies through space and the complex choreography that he��s worked out in this movie is a thing of joy. One minute Gary is ripping down an alley with the camera jostling after him as if desperate to keep up; the next he��s careering down a street the camera now steadily gliding alongside him." he��s a wide-eyed recruit on the receiving end of another man��s fists. He doesn��t talk much. The movie written by the playwright Gregory Burke favors narrative devices like foreshadowing and doubling over the usual blabbity blab an approach that dovetails with Mr. Demange��s talent for elegantly deployed action. The blood that pours from Gary��s face bluntly sets the scene but also foreshadows the river of red to come. Similarly the obstacle course that Gary and his fellow soldiers soon run leaping and going belly down in the muck forecasts the more punishing hurdles to come. Meanwhile a short elliptical sequence of Gary and his young brother Darren (Harry Verity) adds some personal detail even as it presages the later appearance of a second boy." which certainly worked for James Joyce in ���Ulysses.�� Whether or not the filmmakers self-consciously borrowed from that book��s chapter set during one hallucinatory Dublin evening Gary��s journey into this other night-town is similarly a voyage into the self. In between sprints ��� he��s soon fleeing a breakaway faction of the I.R.A. led by an eager killer Quinn (Killian Scott) ��� he meets several souls who help him out sometimes a bit too conveniently including a father and daughter Eamon (Richard Dormer) and Brigid (Charlie Murphy). What Gary doesn��t know is that the biggest threat may come in the form of an undercover British unit led by a twitchy captain Browning (a ferocious Sean Harris). The enemy of Gary��s enemy is closing in." on a broken-down street they shakily stand at the ready while other British soldiers raid a building noisily roughing up its inhabitants. As shouts ring out inside locals begin gathering outside. Before long the British soldiers are facing off with screaming civilians who soon engulf them. Mr. Demange inserts you right in the midst of this tumult bringing you cheek to cheek with each side and using the trembling camerawork to create a visual instability that deepens the sense of escalating danger. Within a few minutes one soldier is dead his brains splattered across a wall and Gary is on the run his unit having inadvertently left him behind in the chaos."

which shows a number of young people mostly women reacting excitedly to their school acceptance letters. Captured in what looks like their own home videos they whoop their joy as Mr. Dick cranks ���Pomp and Circumstance.�� These upbeat scenes give way to images of students descending on campuses and then a handful of older people talking while decked in somber caps and gowns. ���As your parents learned when they dropped you off today �� one gray-haired man in purple says ���what happens in college stays in college ��� most of the time.�� There��s no indication of who he is; he��s just a representation of male power enjoying a sinister-sounding joke seemingly at the expense of those young faces." �� a documentary shocker about rape on American college campuses goes right for the gut. A blunt instrument of a movie it derives its power largely from the many young women and some men recounting on camera how they were raped at their schools and then subsequently denied justice by those same schools. Their stories ��� delivered in sorrow and rage with misting eyes and squared jaws ��� make this imperfect movie a must-watch work of cine-activism one that should be seen by anyone headed to college and by those already on campus." the gray-haired man is just a place-holder meant to represent the real adults who fail campus rape victims. Inserting nonspecific material to advance a specific argument is a standard documentary practice. It can be misleading and at times undermine a movie��s claim on the truth. Here though the use of a one-nameless-guy-fits-all image material is merely unnecessary and a bit baffling given how much great detailed information Mr. Dick has gathered. Again and again he adds cinematic exclamation points when none are needed. At one point during a sequence in which a woman describes her assault he briefly slips into horror-flick mode and inserts a shot of a door ominously opening; soon after he switches gears and moods by starting up the Lady Gaga and Diane Warren song ���Till It Happens to You.��" Ms. Yoffe took issue with the statistic that one in five women will have been sexually assaulted by the time they graduate a number that��s been invoked by President Obama and is repeated in ���The Hunting Ground.�� Mr. Dick wields that number and many others as if to assure us that there are statistics to back up these testimonials. He doesn��t need to play the numbers game. The women and men taking on institutional power are getting the message out ��� brilliantly." a coach for their handling of her reported rape by three school basketball players. On Feb. 9 the university and Mr. Altman filed a countersuit against the female student." who say they became acquainted after Ms. Pino was raped in 2012 while enrolled in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Ms. Pino reached out to Ms. Clark who said that she too had been raped at the school. The two became allies and friends and in 2013 they filed a Title IX complaint against the university with the Department of Education. It��s unclear when Mr. Dick contacted Ms. Pino and Ms. Clark whose stirring stories he charts with seamlessly integrated original and archival material." inspiring figures and they along with the other women and men who talk openly about their school histories and ordeals are the reasons to see ���The Hunting Ground.�� As Ms. Pino Ms. Clark and the other interviewees share their lives on camera their voices underscore that publicly talking about rape isn��t just an act of political radicalism but also a way for survivors to reclaim their lives. By speaking out they are asserting that they rather than their assailants are the narrators of their own stories the agents of their destinies. Mr. Dick doesn��t specifically address this openness but it��s impossible not to think ��� as woman after woman speaks ��� that it is female empowerment itself that is driving some of the backlash directed at rape activists. Mr. Dick addresses that backlash rather obliquely as in a section in which interviewees swat away the issue of false rape claims. It��s too bad that he doesn��t dig into whether the new guidelines to protect (mostly) women are infringing on the civil rights of men as Emily Yoffe argued in Slate last December." �� the writer-director Kirby Dick working with the producer Amy Ziering crams a crowd of faces and one seemingly unwieldy subject into a painful absorbing if periodically cluttered 103-minute documentary. (The filmmaking pair previously collaborated on the documentaries ���Outrage �� about homophobia among American political elites and ���The Invisible War �� about sexual assault in the United States military.) Subscribing to the more-is-more school of documentary the director pulls out all of the stops in this movie using talking-head interviews v�rit�-like scenes seemingly generic archival imagery seemingly nongeneric archival imagery and numerous graphics including some footnote-like citations. Visually the movie is somewhat of a mess and although that can be frustrating it does reflect wittingly or not the cacophony defining the current discourse on rape." sometimes furious and at times crudely simplistic national discussion about sexual assault. Fueling that discussion is the Obama administration which has made the issue a priority. In 2014 the White House released guidelines on how campus rapes are to be treated. In a move that continues to make waves it also released the names of 55 schools ��� from Harvard College to the University of California Berkeley ��� that were under investigation by the Department of Education for their handling (or mishandling) of rape accusations. At issue is whether they violated federal laws under Title IX which bans gender discrimination at colleges receiving federal money." but there are instances when it could benefit from a more conventional approach. That becomes evident when Mr. Dick focuses on an image of Michael Gottfredson president of the University of Oregon from 2012 to 2014 and some text reading: ���Allowed two basketball players accused of involvement in a gang rape to play in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Both players were expelled after the tournament.��"

Villains in movies like ���The Salvation�� tend to be like nesting Russian dolls with the heaviest heavies invariably hovering in the background until it becomes time for them to emerge. There is a puppet master of sorts in ���The Salvation�� who helps make Delarue jump and gives the movie a weak glimmer of a political back story though one as persuasive as ���F Troop.�� The movie��s Danish director Kristian Levring (���The King Is Alive��) may be interested in the historical forces that made European immigrants wittingly or not agents of American expansionism but his nods to the 19th-century ebb and flow of labor and capital feel distinctly ritualistic." which is Mr. Levring��s most eccentric and original filmmaking choice. Much of the movie looks bathed in an ocher yellow (presumably the colors were digitally tweaked in postproduction) which gives Jon a nice tan to go along with the rocky dusty terrain. The colors are often striking if at times somewhat distracting ��� a rich maroon coat gleams alongside other costumes ornamented with splashes of teal purple and pink ��� but they also help emphasize the strangeness of the story and its world.

About the only thing that remains fairly fixed is Mr. Mikkelsen��s face whose sharp jutting angles suggest despite its stubble that he shaves with a hand plane. This stillness draws the eye (and has of course long worked for Mr. Eastwood) and suggests mystery when there isn��t any. This lack of mystery doesn��t hurt the movie but rather fits a story as elemental as this one that at times resembles an illustrated list of genre codes and conventions: black hat white hat six-shooter horse." lavishly violent western ���The Salvation�� takes place in an America shaped less by history than by the legacies of some of its chroniclers from Sergio Leone to Clint Eastwood to Paul Thomas Anderson. Set in a nameless dusty patch of the Southwest apparently forsaken by God as well as the law it spins a far-fetched tale of a not-so-simple Danish homesteader Jon (Mads Mikkelsen) turned avenger. Yes there will be blood as well as Eva Green as Madelaine whose corset cups runneth over and tongue was once ripped out by her Indian captors." an old B western a Charles Bronson flick and well just about any chronicle of vengeance.

But you may find yourself drawn back to it and retracing its route from the familiar to the uncanny from entertainment to revulsion from dream to nightmare." ���Maps to the Stars�� may be just what you need. Suavely directed by David Cronenberg from an elegantly waspish script by Bruce Wagner it belongs to the venerable tradition of movieland self-loathing. The film tipping its hat to Nathanael West��s ���The Day of the Locust�� and Mr. Wagner��s own novels imagines Los Angeles as an inferno of narcissism greed and sexual perversity. The radiant sunshine has a sinister glow and the blossoms on the trees are surely poisonous." directors and studio executives unfold with mordant black humor. We have seen a lot of this before of course but Mr. Cronenberg is not interested in rolling out yet another red carpet for our show-business prurience. What is most unnerving about ���Maps to the Stars�� is the sinister quiet punctuated by Howard Shore��s panicky score. Mr. Cronenberg��s recent films wherever they happen ��� the Middle America of ���A History of Violence �� the Russian underworld of ���Eastern Promises �� the early-20th-century Europe of ���A Most Dangerous Method�� ��� seem to take place on the edge of an abyss. If you listen carefully you can hear the first tremors of the end of the world an outcome that can��t be prevented only deferred by the unfolding of a narrative." teasing ultimately self-congratulatory satire that you find on television shows like ���Entourage�� or ���Curb Your Enthusiasm.�� Its deadpan humor and sepulchral mood might put you in mind of ���Sunset Boulevard�� and it shares with that film (and with this review) an obsession with the cinematic past. Hollywood often misunderstood as a desert of shallow novelty is a place weirdly even morbidly obsessed with its own history. Much of the real estate is haunted by memories of half-forgotten stars and scandals." �� though they could be hallucinations. In a city governed by fantasy and superstition that amounts to a distinction without a difference. Havana Segrand (Ms. Moore) an actress perpetually on the verge of coming apart sees the apparition of her mother a more famous actress who died young in a fire.

He and his wife Cristina (Olivia Williams) live in terror that a shameful secret will be revealed though that might not make them as special as they think. Their world is small and the theme of incest that threads through the main plots of ���Maps to the Stars�� is both literal and metaphorical. It may not be the freshest metaphor but Mr. Wagner��s low-key creepiness and Mr. Cronenberg��s spooky precision breathe new life into a few other tired ideas as well." where damaged souls come to breathe and reflect. The grotesque humor of Mr. Wagner��s script feels less like a distancing gesture ��� hey let��s laugh at these freaks ��� than a route toward empathy. Ms. Moore��s performance is certainly that. Few actresses go as deep into their characters and push them so relentlessly toward the furthest edge of sympathy. (Isabelle Huppert is the only one I can think of at the moment). Havana does some hateful things but it isn��t quite possible to hate her." Agatha (Mia Wasikowska) who was banished from the family after setting a fire that may have been intended to kill him. Agatha is alive but by far the most frightening revenant in the movie. Arriving in Los Angeles by bus she befriends a limo driver (Robert Pattinson who played a limo passenger in Mr. Cronenberg��s ���Cosmopolis��) and parlays an Internet acquaintanceship with Carrie Fisher into a job as Havana��s personal assistant." but the decline will be slow enough to allow for a great many more movies to be made before fire global warming Facebook or some other plague devours everything. Mr. Wagner is like most satirists a savage moralist and he marvels at the callous cruelty of his carefully groomed creatures. Benjie in particular is a hothouse flower of sociopathy bred by Stafford and Cristina and by his environment to be cynical selfish and rude. His peers are no different. His parents are worse. Havana for her part is a Santa Ana wind of need neurosis and solipsism. The least horrible person might be Agatha who is also the most dangerous."

The cartoonish quality of Mr. Szifron��s violence has age-old appeal of course which is itself a moral to ponder. Notably he is on shakier ground when he tries to complicate the stakes as he does in ���The Deal �� about a wealthy family that pins a crime on a gardener who��s willing to take the fall for a price. He recovers nicely with ������Til Death Do Us Part�� a brutally gloriously streamlined story of love and jealousy that blows up a wedding filling the screen with tumult and kisses." ���Wild Tales�� opens on a savage note and ends well that��s for you to find out. In between its shocker start and equally startling windup this Argentine anthology offers up a scabrous often unsettlingly funny look at human behavior in extremis. It��s a mad mad social Darwinian world churning with men and women who whether pushed a lot or just a little are all eager to do the worst to one another. They pounce and then they pummel engaging in drag-down fights that leave them black and blue and sometimes stone-cold dead." sometimes murderous reaction to a grievance real or perceived major or absurdly minor. In the second story ���The Rats �� a greasy-spoon waitress Moza (Julieta Zylberberg) realizes that her only customer Cuenca (C�sar Bord�_n) once did her family a profound injustice. Mr. Szifron sets the scene skillfully starting with a dark and stormy night that inaugurates an equally foreboding initial exchange between waitress and customer. ���Party of one? �� Moza asks with a smile. ���I see you��re good at math �� Cuenca says by way of hello.

Mr. Turner is a sly agreeable presence. Bill as a child (Sebastian Rice Edwards in ���Hope and Glory��) was watchful in a manner befitting a future director and in this chapter he sometimes seems more observer than participant. But that is at least partly a self-protective ruse. Percy is a passionate rebel who eagerly courts trouble for laughs and for revenge." Redmond (Pat Shortt) is a seasoned skiver. This wonderful bit of slang connotes a special blend of scheming and laziness a commitment to do as little as possible without getting caught. Bill is somewhere in between Percy and Redmond wielding a quietly subversive irony as his weapon against the absurdities of army life." �� John Boorman��s gently nostalgic quasi-autobiographical film about Britain in the early 1950s it isn��t entirely necessary to have seen his earlier ���Hope and Glory.�� You should of course see it if you haven��t already: One of a handful of great movies that look at World War II through the eyes of a child ���Hope and Glory�� is distinguished by mischievous good humor and by the unashamed acknowledgment that war can be fun as well as horrible." and so is the heightened wide-eyed perceptiveness of the child protagonist. A young man is a more pedestrian creature and the ��50s a quieter decade. Bill��s family the focus of much of the drama in ���Hope and Glory �� is glimpsed here in a few lovely scenes. The update is welcome." �� the army provides a loose frame around the action here. But Mr. Boorman approaches his story in the relaxed and generous manner of a raconteur charming the audience rather than pushing us through the machinery of a plot. Our attention wanders into Bill��s romantic life where his own attention is divided between Sophie (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) a warm good-humored nurse and a chilly melancholy college student he knows as Ophelia (Tamsin Egerton). Each has other suitors which is awkward farcical and painful like much of what happens in the movie." �� which catches up with Bill (Callum Turner) at the age of 18 begins with a flashback to a memorable scene of childish jubilation during the Blitz as the boy and his classmates respond with cries of ���Thanks Adolf!�� to the news that a German bomb has smashed their school. A similar irreverence pervades this new chapter in Bill��s adventures. When he is conscripted into the army his natural resistance to authority is both tested and given fresh opportunities to express itself. The military with its endless protocols and musty hierarchies is a nonconformist��s purgatory and a prankster��s paradise." fleeting yet precisely detailed of Britain at a time of change. The overt manifestation of that change is the arrival of the sovereign who gives ���Queen and Country�� its title and who inspires cynicism and patriotism in its characters. But as the young Elizabeth IItakes the throne you can feel the ground shifting and a different Britain coming into view: the one that would give the world angry young playwrights rock ��n�� roll bands and resourceful iconoclastic filmmakers like John Boorman." Bill and his best pal Percy Hapgood (the Cagneyesque Caleb Landry Jones) are put in charge of a typing class. Their supervisor is a humorless martinet always eager to report the tiniest infraction to his commander (Richard E. Grant). There is a stark contentious generational split between the older officers who served in the earlier war and the young men who are a bit sick of hearing about it and also eager to taste some of the freedom the elders fought to preserve.

if finally in a sense redeemed by cinema. Under Israeli law a woman can be divorced only if her husband presents her with a religious bill of divorce called a gett (sometimes spelled get). No gett no divorce. The long-suffering title character desperately wants to be free of her husband who refuses to let her go. So year after year Viviane pleads her case before a rabbinic court waiting for her divorce as days slip into weeks and then months her pacific face glazed with tears and her body occasionally rocked by a laugh tinged with knowing and madness." a political metaphor a shout to heaven and earth. The movie��s title brings to mind all those novels named after their protagonists especially women with tribulations (Jane Eyre Madame Bovary Anna Karenina) but the word trial also almost predictably suggests Franz Kafka. It soon becomes clear why. In Israel all divorces and marriages even secular ones are under the power of rabbinic courts and therefore Orthodox Jewish law. A wife who doesn��t receive a gett from her husband becomes an ���agunah�� ��� chained or anchored woman. A husband can be chained too although this is apparently rarer." almost implausibly so. ���Gett�� is the third movie featuring Viviane that Ms. Elkabetz has written and directed with her brother Shlomi Elkabetz after ���To Take a Wife�� and ���Shiva�� a.k.a. ���Seven Days �� and their work here is assured streamlined and bold. As if to underscore the highly subjective quality of the storytelling in ���Gett�� (he said she said they said) the Elkabetzes use only point-of-view shots throughout which tethers every image ��� of the judges of Viviane��s legs of Elisha��s profile ��� to the perspective of one of the characters. This concentrated focus underscores the personal stakes and torques the tension so that even the image of Viviane letting down her hair ��� and incurring the wrath of the court ��� becomes a tremulous action scene." Ms. Elkabetz is never more effective than when she��s holding still her face so drained of emotion that it transforms into a screen within the screen on which another indelibly private movie is playing. This stillness can be transfixing in close-up because the human face remains one of cinema��s great landscapes even if our screens are cluttered with banally framed head-and-shoulder shots. There��s nothing indifferent about the human face here especially Viviane��s. That��s why every so often the filmmakers fill the screen with her face allowing you to traverse its planes and trace its lines and in the process discover a woman who ��� even as she has been denied her freedom ��� retains a stubborn transcendent humanity." sometimes to each other quietly slipping between Hebrew and French ��� much of the talking is done for them. ���Gett�� is a trial narrative complete with witness testimonies and periodic admonitions from the judge but with little of the courtroom dramatics that characterize mainstream legal stories. Nothing if not dialectical ���Gett�� instead unfolds as a debate about love marriage and human rights that turns on personal stories and philosophical asides arguments and counterarguments. As one witness after another testifies about Viviane and Elisha��s marriage her virtue his rectitude it becomes clear that divorce here isn��t a personal choice but a matter for God and a people." ���Gett�� focuses on Viviane��s determined efforts to divorce her longtime husband Elisha (Simon Abkarian) a pious man with whom she has had several children and an apparently unhappy life. As radical in its narrative conceit as it is in its secular politics the movie takes place almost entirely inside a rabbinic court presided over by a nameless judge (Eli Gorstein) who is flanked by two others on a raised podium embellished only with an emblem of a menorah. These three bearded men in black suits and kipas stare down upon Viviane and her lawyer Carmel (Menashe Noy) who are usually seated at a small plain table next to a similarly humble table where Elisha is dourly parked sometimes with his brother and advocate Shimon (Sasson Gabay)."

He has his own helicopter which he pilots himself; an underground garage full of cars with a chauffeur to drive them; a penthouse apartment with a grand piano; and a walk-in closet so big that his suits hang without even touching." if one attempts to read it in any other way than as a sexual stimulus to read it say as a psychological case-history of the author��s sexual fantasies one is bored to tears.�� In defiance of this irrefutable good sense the ���Fifty Shades�� phenomenon has spawned innumerable kink-themed think pieces though the analysis has dwelt less on Ms. James��s psyche than on the fantasies of the tens of millions of women who have bought her books. The writers transform their boredom into mockery and judgment as they circle around a tantalizing perhaps frustrating question. Why do so many women read these novels even though they have no literary value?" but the one thing it can��t be ��� the thing the novel so trashily and triumphantly is ��� is pornography. Ms. Taylor-Johnson��s sex scenes are not that much different from other R-rated sex scenes though there are more of them and more hardware is involved. You know the routine: an arched neck some curled toes a buttock here a breast there a wisp of pubic hair a muffled moan another Beyonc� song. Maybe a riding crop for variety." perhaps more than the actual movie did. Was it delight? Derision? Embarrassment? Surprise? All of the above?" but I can venture a guess: for fun. They seem to be the kind of books you can simultaneously have fun with make fun of trash and cherish and adapt to the pursuit of your own pleasures. Which brings me back to the laughter at the end of the sneak preview. ���Fifty Shades of Grey�� might not be a good movie ��� O.K. it��s a terrible movie ��� but it might nonetheless be a movie that feels good to see whether you squirm or giggle or roll your eyes or just sit still and take your punishment." this hardly matters. In fact it��s something of an asset. Anastasia��s inner life exists to fill the space between sex scenes and her zigzagging responses to Christian��s proposals make the fantasy more inclusive while also providing an escape clause. ���Fifty Shades�� is both daring and conventional falling back into traditional gender roles even as it plays with transgressive desires. Christian��s sexual tastes are intriguing to Anastasia but they are also the result of emotional wounds that she sets herself the task of healing. He wants to take charge of her and she wants to take care of him. She tolerates the kind of sex he wants and even enjoys some of it but what she really wants is something more and she wants to make him want that too. She loves him but love in these tales functions less as an emotional ideal than as a literary safe word a return ticket to the land of romance." but the bad writing serves an important purpose. ���Fifty Shades�� not only destigmatizes kink bringing bondage and spanking to airport bookstores and reading groups across the land. But it also so to speak de-sophisticates certain sexual practices taking them out of the chateau and the boudoir and other fancy French places and planting them in the soil of Anglo-American banality. If E. L. James were a better writer her books would be more ��� to use one of Anastasia��s favorite words ��� intimidating. And much less useful." for that matter in Christian��s.

�� the latest from Lana and Andy Wachowski is a big woozy spacey fairy tale with a science-fiction exoskeleton and a core of pure mush. With its nods to the original ���Star Trek�� and David Lynch��s proto-steampunk hallucination ���Dune �� it seduces the eye with filigreed flourishes even as the mind reels from some of the mildewy storytelling. Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones an earthling who turns out to be the reconstituted queen of the universe or some such which apparently means that she needs to be repeatedly rescued. An uncomfortable-looking Channing Tatum plays her hybrid honey Caine Wise a man-wolf with pointy ears and my what big bulging muscles." �� he seems more comfortable inhabiting this fantasia than Mr. Tatum does. Then again Mr. Bean doesn��t have to wear pointy ears. The ears are amusing but they��re almost all that��s memorable about the sketchily conceived Caine. Like Ms. Kunis Mr. Tatum is a charismatic screen presence who often feels lost amid the clutter and chaos in ���Jupiter Ascending.�� In another movie these two stars might have been able to add life and layers to their characters; here they just seem to be trying to keep up with the action. The performances are especially unconvincing in the quieter intimate scenes because while the Wachowskis know how to put on a big show and ��� like many other spectacle-minded filmmakers ��� excel at blowing their fantasies to smithereens they too often fumble something more crucial and more difficult to pull off: ordinary believable human emotions." including lavishly detailed sets and costumes. After the story really starts churning ��� there are good guys and bad a spectrum of skin colors a gallery��s worth of body art and some soft ritualistic jabs against capitalism ��� Jupiter ends up way way over the rainbow. There she meets overripe villains like Balem Abrasax one of those decadent aristo-cats with a sneer on his lips and blood on his hands who once would have been played by a camping Jeremy Irons but is now played by a camping Eddie Redmayne. If you��re familiar with the fall of Rome you get the big picture more or less but with spaceships." yet it��s startling how inattentive they can be to certain filmmaking fundamentals like two shots. They��re good at making entire worlds but whether distracted by the big stuff or bored by the putatively small they have a tough time making a conversation between two people come alive. So once again they give you loads of fun stuff to look at whether Jupiter is hanging onto Caine��s back as he skates across the sky or she��s wearing a fab flowery headdress that would have made Elizabeth Taylor moan. Every square inch of this movie feels so obsessed over that it��s startling how rapidly the Wachowskis breeze through all their sets and setups. (It��s hard not to think that the original edit ran hours longer.)" Jupiter has to verify her status as the genetically reborn queen with some paperwork an amusingly pedestrian errand that finds her briefly entering a bureaucratic spiral as she goes from office to office including one run by a Dickensian gargoyle nestled in a lair festooned with shadows and old-fashioned machines. It��s a pleasantly decrepit suggestive tableau because as this extraterrestrial creature punches the keys on one machine and turns the crank on another you get a sense of all the many histories poured into this science-fiction world. But before you can really take it all in Jupiter is rushing toward the next plot twist. Part Alice in weirdland part imperiled Pauline she periodically hitches a ride in the arms of Mr. Tatum��s wolf-man Caine and occasionally joins up with another he-man Stinger Apini played with relaxed appeal by Sean Bean." the answer to the audience��s potential uninterest or worse the vaguest tremor of boredom has always been more: more plot more special effects more violence more coolness more awesomeness ��� the better to dazzle or bludgeon you my dear. In the one movie in which it didn��t feel as if they were simply piling on ��� ���The Matrix �� as if there was any doubt ��� they found a story that dovetailed with their will to spectacle and ended up with a tour de force. It��s been fairly rough going for them ever since whether they��ve taken on someone else��s excesses (as in their 2012 adaptation with Tom Tykwer of David Mitchell��s ���Cloud Atlas��) or have ventured forth with their own original screenplay as in the case of ���Jupiter Ascending.��" doing the Cinderella thing with truckloads of pluck and eye makeup.

She responds to this surprising close encounter not with screams or dazed smiles but with what feels like typical 21st-century insouciance: She takes a photo of them with her phone. Her apparent indifference seems bizarre at best. (There��s more going on because well in this movie there always is.) Yet intentionally or not it also telegraphs just how tough it is to impress an audience that��s inundated and perhaps terminally dulled by images."

Marieme is tall and athletic but her habit of looking down and hunching her shoulders makes her appear slighter and more delicate than she is. She lives with her mother two younger sisters and an older brother Djibril (Cyril Mendy) a moody sometimes frightening would-be patriarch. She has a crush on one of his friends Isma�l (Idrissa Diabate) but can barely meet his eyes.

It��s worth noting that the state which usually shows up in French movies in the form of the police the educational system or the strongly implied ideals of the Republic is barely present here. And its absence increases the sense that Vic and her friends are alone and vulnerable safe and valued only in the uneasy cocoon they weave together." with pads and helmets and hard contact at the line of scrimmage. This may come as a surprise in a French movie. Shouldn��t they be playing soccer? Another surprise: All of the players are girls mostly of African descent and residents of a high-rise housing complex on the outskirts of Paris. So right from the start before the plot has gotten underway ���Girlhood�� insists that the world will not conform to easy categories or lazy expectations." it doesn��t feel like a misery-mongering expression of high-minded (and therefore condescending) concern. This is because Karidja Tour� evolving from the shy Marieme into the assertive Vic carries herself with the kind of dignity that disarms all pity and also because Ms. Sciamma whose previous explorations of female adolescence include ���Tomboy�� and ���Water Lilies �� is less interested in what Marieme might represent than in what she experiences. While the movie has a lot to say about the general condition of being a girl in the Paris banlieues and elsewhere it never loses sight of the specific girl at its heart." and it honors the genre and its main character with exemplary sensitivity and sympathy. But even as she stops at familiar stations on the road to maturity ��� problems at home and school new friendships and first love ��� Ms. Sciamma revels in the risky reckless exuberance of adolescence and in the sheer joy of filming it." but it��s hardly complete. Even a girl as defiant and self-possessed as Lady is still subject to male authority which in this neighborhood rests on a complex set of codes and customs. Some of these are rooted in old religious and cultural traditions others in the Darwinian realities of poverty crime and social marginality. Vic must keep her interest in Isma�l a secret because Djibril��s honor and reputation would be compromised if she were known to be sexually active. At the same time she and her friends even as they terrorize and dominate rival girl posses are careful not to antagonize the drug dealers and pimps who run the housing projects."

The most obvious vice exhibited by members of the militia controlling the desert city of Timbuktu in the name of Allah is hypocrisy." far from being ���an apology for terrorism �� as the mayor (who of course had not seen it) supposed is an unflinching quietly furious exploration of life under radical Islamist rule. It also makes a point about power that even nonextremist democratically elected leaders would do well to keep in mind. When you try to restrict the movies people can see the music they can play or the opinions they can express ��� in the name of whatever theological or secular ideal you claim to represent ��� you may or may not become a monster. That you will make a fool of yourself is in contrast a moral certainty." but it returns frequently to the tent in the dusty hills outside the city where Kidane (Ibrahim Ahmed) lives with his wife Satima (Toulou Kiki) and their daughter Toya (Layla Walet Mohamed) tending cows and drinking tea. The presence of the heavily armed fanatics running Timbuktu sends a dispute involving Kidane and one of his neighbors spinning toward tragedy and horror but Kidane is more than just an innocent victim in just the way that Mr. Sissako��s film is more than a simple polemic. He is a symbol of decency and tolerance of everything the extremists want to destroy precisely because he is an intriguing fully rendered individual. And ���Timbuktu�� is a political film in the way that ���The Bicycle Thief�� or ���Modern Times�� is a political film: It feels at once timely and permanent immediate and essential." discreetly presented." ���Bamako�� (named for Mali��s capital city) similarly embedded a political argument in a rich evocation of daily life. In that film the main action is a surreal (but entirely earnest) trial of the institutions of neo-liberalism for crimes against Africa. But the story keeps wondering off into the streets of the city taking refuge from abstraction in the pleasures and travails of everyday life." Abderrahmane Sissako��s ���Timbuktu �� an official selection in Cannes last year and a current nominee for the best foreign-language film Oscar was caught up in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo murders when the mayor of a Paris suburb briefly succeeded in banning it from a local cinema. Coming amid an outpouring of public and official support for freedom of speech this act of censorship was both dismaying and ridiculous." it is un peu Charlie Hebdo though Mr. Sissako��s sensibility is gentler his satirical impulse less scabrous and his imagination more expansive than that shared by most of the magazine��s cartoonists. There is a strong current of anger and disgust running through his film which was inspired by the Islamist takeover of Timbuktu and other parts of northern Mali in 2012. With some adjustments it could have been set in Syria Iraq Nigeria or Pakistan. But the glory of ���Timbuktu�� lies in its devotion to local knowledge in the way it allows its gaze to wander away from violence toward images of beauty and grace." which is the kind of accusation that is often unthinkingly leveled at stories that veer away from presenting political conflict as a simple fight between good and evil. How could the bad guys be anything other than human? Their folly lies in the belief that they can transcend that condition and terrorize their fellow Muslims into holiness. They may be sincere in their devotion to their God and his prophet but they are still jerks. ���Timbuktu�� is an act of resistance and revenge because it asserts the power of secularism not as an ideology but rather as a stubborn fact of life."

But the film��s ability to provoke such strong negative sentiments and at the same time ��� even within the same viewer ��� equally strong feelings of sympathy solidarity and identification is testament to Mr. Dolan��s talent. To take ���Mommy�� as an undisciplined outpouring of aggression and angst is to underestimate its artistry. He has both advanced beyond the romanticism of ���Heartbeats�� and ���Laurence Anyways�� and regressed toward a more primal and confrontational mode of storytelling. ���Mommy�� may seem out of control but it knows exactly what it��s doing." director and actor Xavier Dolan is only 25 but ���Mommy �� his fifth feature film in five years seems like the work of an even younger filmmaker.

Not long after making it to the stage Simon makes a suicidal dive into the orchestra pit that lands him a 30-day stay in a psychiatric hospital." a rich young woman who boasts of having had a perfect life until she came home to find her husband molesting their young daughter. Recalling that Simon in one of his movies played a man who went berserk and killed his neighbors she imagines that he is an expert at murder and entreats him to kill her husband. Her confusion of movies and life distills one of the film��s themes: the difficulty of distinguishing reality from fantasy especially for an actor in search of truthfulness while playing roles."

Mr. Roth is 81; Mr. Pacino 74; Mr. Levinson 72; and Mr. Henry 84. All were once young Turks and should know a thing or two about evolving from boy geniuses into lions in winter.

A scene in which he picks up a shotgun and prepares to shoot himself like Ernest Hemingway then bungles it is played for comedy.

Simon��s response to her is that of an aging stud throwing up his hands in frustration trying to keep up with her and blaming women for his troubles. The screenplay��s misogyny extends to the vindictive Sybil who carries out the murder herself and lies to police investigators by naming Simon as a co-conspirator." a transgender man who despite his gender reassignment is still besotted with Pegeen.

As the attendees sniffle and dab their red eyes the group facilitator Annette (Felicity Huffman) encourages the women to process their grief. ���Will you forgive me?�� Annette asks pretending to speak for Nina.

The introduction of Nina��s husband Roy (Sam Worthington) gives Ms. Aniston an excuse to warm Claire up. But he��s a distraction and an unfortunate one because Claire��s most dynamic relationship is with her Latina housekeeper Silvana (Adriana Barraza very good) an exploited saint. Their relationship borders on the embarrassingly unexamined and Silvana is woefully underwritten but every so often ��� as when the story follows her home ��� life flickers into view as does another movie about two mutually dependent equals." sad-funny indie drama ���Cake�� centers on a woman and the kind of grief that��s so unbearable this movie can��t even handle it. Jennifer Aniston plays Claire who having survived a horrific accident now lives in near isolation in Los Angeles in a midcentury magazine layout of a house. Its clean lines drawn by an architect and embellished by a period-design obsessive make a vivid contrast with the scars jaggedly slashed across Claire��s face and body.

more benign hacker turned prisoner Hathaway is first seen reading Jean Baudrillard��s ���The System of Objects �� a neo-Marxist critique of the commodification of everyday life. Also adorning Hathaway��s shelves is ���Discipline and Punish �� Michel Foucault��s inquiry into modern penal systems and disciplinary technologies of power including surveillance. The nods to these heavyweights happen in an eye blink and they felt gratuitous and self-conscious the first time I saw ���Blackhat.�� (Jean-Fran�_ois Lyotard��s ���The Postmodern Condition�� is also on the shelf as is Jacques Derrida.)" pegged to a shadow hacker stirring up global trouble could have been gleaned from the latest news. The inspiration for the script by Morgan Davis Foehl was an attack on the Natanz uranium enrichment plant in Iran by malware deployed through USB flash drives. The movie opens with an explosion at a nuclear power plant in Hong Kong where Chinese officials call in Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom) who in turn taps his sister Lien (Ms. Tang) for help and then an old school friend Nick Hathaway (Mr. Hemsworth)." though notably during a chaotic fight in a crowded Jakarta square that turns multitudes into a streaming network the locations feel like an directorial extravagance and a mistake. Those bodies are finally too decorative and disposable and the ease with which they fall undercuts the movie��s moral seriousness. Mr. Mann fares better in more intimately scaled scenes whether inside a restaurant with Hathaway and Lien or out on the street with some joltingly personal shootouts. Whether his characters are making love or war Mr. Mann often captures them in tight close-ups that thrust their faces into the foreground of the shot. It��s a visual choice that briefly isolates these men and women from a world that like everyone else they��re desperate to comprehend." pasty criminal hacker even if his bulk makes sense as a jailhouse defense. He isn��t a persuasive typist (he was tutored on his keyboard fingerwork) but what he does have is a natural pensiveness bordering on melancholy that creates a nice frisson with his bulging muscles and heartthrob looks. You can see him diving into thought which works for a role that requires his character to serve as our conduit for a lot of jargon. His strong physicality also works with the movie��s sense of hacking and other tech work as labor." many of which involve following the digital trail left by the hacker who infiltrated the nuclear plant. That initially makes ���Blackhat�� a cat-and-mouse game one that shifts into high-action gear with the introduction of the hacker��s army of thugs whose apparatus of choice is a machine gun and whose leader is a dead-eyed enforcer Elias (an excellent Ritchie Coster). The chase takes Hathaway and company through computer networks a pursuit that Mr. Mann at times represents by plunging deep into the physical networks running straight into the guts of the machine much as he did in ���Thief�� when he pushed his camera in for a peek inside a lock cylinder as it��s being picked." Mr. Mann crams a great deal into the movie��s fleet two-hour running time including the nuclear mishap a commodities run-up some cyber-slapstick with the National Security Agency and the specter of 9/11. Once Hathaway has been cut loose from federal lockup with an ankle monitor he joins a stellar backup team tasked with catching the power-plant hacker that includes Viola Davis on lead. Her character Carol Barrett is an agent for the F.B.I. whose reddish wig plumy lashes and cavalcade of weary sighs and devastating deadpan stares are among the movie��s best special effects. Barrett serves as Hathaway��s handler and coordinates the American team with the Chinese while Ms. Davis��s fine-grained performance deepens the movie��s emotional texture." �� Mr. Mann��s 1981 thriller Hathaway is defined ��� as a man and professional but also as a friend lover and target ��� through his job. The characters in ���Blackhat�� spend a great deal of time staring at screens and making like Rachmaninoff with their keyboards a familiar image for the increasing numbers of people who are plugged in for work play or both even as they��re increasingly disconnected from the physical world. This disconnect and its dangers are something of a refrain in the movie and are invoked in Hathaway��s prison-house philosophy (when not perusing Baudrillard he connects mind and body by um doing ironman push-ups) and in the conceit of faceless terrorists who hidden in a virtual world wreak damage on human beings." �� a story about the intersection of bodies and machines is a spectacular work of unhinged moviemaking. By turns brutal and sentimental lovely and lurid as serious as the grave and blissfully preposterous it combines a truckload of plot with many of the obsessions tropes sights and sounds that distinguish his other movies from kinetic gun battles to cool beauties gazing into the distance in sunglasses. Here those beauties are a pair of improbable computer savants played by Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei who race jet and furiously bang on keyboards across the globe while chasing villainy lines of code and millions in loot." even if name-dropping philosophers has long been par for the cinematic course for the likes of say Jean-Luc Godard. Yet such allusions are of a piece with Mr. Mann��s singular hybrid approach which exists at the crossroads of the classical Hollywood cinema and the European art film and is evident in his oscillation between action and introspection transformation and stasis exterior and interior realms." as are the various Far Eastern locations that add palpable density to the movie��s thin-looking at times near-translucent visuals. The contrast between the richness of the action and the thinness of the (still beautiful) images is just one of many dualities that run through the movie as when Mr. Mann cuts from a fanlike image spreading across a screen to a huge flame shooting out from under a Hong Kong cook��s wok. Time and again he puts computer and other spaces into play visually mapping a brave new world with images of kaleidoscopically pulsing screens and the jewel-like glittering of nighttime megacities. The practical locations with real bodies moving through real spaces underline the idea that something big is still at stake in the physical world."

Whatever the case after the bandages come off in one decade the newly mustachioed temporal agent turns up tending bar in another pouring shots for a man curiously known only as the Unmarried Mother (Sarah Snook wearing a sneer and a sack suit). The Unmarried Mother writes confession stories from the women��s angle one he knows intimately. He has a story to tell which begins with ���When I was a little girl�� and leaps across the years and yawning gaps in logic." Mr. Hawke serves as both the narrator and the story��s ballast amid all the woo-woo interludes and disruptions the puzzle piece you hold and worry about even as the scenery changes and identities shift. His temporal agent contains sly multitudes and could easily have become a gimmick but Mr. Hawke brings enough pathos and soul to his performance that the conceit soon becomes a man ��� well for starters." �� a mind-and-body-bending short-story classic that he wrote in 1958. From its many temporal and sexual kinks the story suggests that Mr. Heinlein was looking to dust off H. G. Wells��s time-travel machinations with some 1950s-style transgender sizzle borrowed from one of the tale��s touchstones Christine Jorgensen. This is a story that doesn��t just swallow its tail it eats itself whole but Mr. Heinlein��s narrative sleights of hand are very much of a piece with his playful take on identity.

There��s a boom a mess of melting flesh and shortly thereafter the temporal agent is in bed with his face wrapped in bandages much like Humphrey Bogart��s in the 1947 noir ���Dark Passage.�� In that film (based on a David Goodis novel) Bogart��s character wrongly accused of murder undergoes plastic surgery to avoid recapture. ���Predestination�� similarly plays around with enduring topics like fate and imprisonment metaphysical and otherwise and pins them on a character forced to change identities. But it also tosses in a whole lot of time travel." thankless business in ���Predestination �� a slab of science-fiction speculation draped in old-fashioned detective story crepe. The story centers on a temporal agent a futuristic enforcer (he tries to right wrongs before they happen) nicely played by Ethan Hawke with a hungry hangdog look that suggests that his character has spent long nights howling in the wasteland often without either a scrap or a prayer. Whether slinking through 1985 or another vintage year (usually while chasing down a bomber) the temporal agent looks like a classic lone wolf." but is more persuasive when dolled up in period dresses with a slash of red lipstick.

There are tourist-ready images of the Rhine Falls and of a river where Schiller who can��t swim risks his life to save a drowning girl." ���Beloved Sisters�� has the feel of a historical pageant; it is a game of dress-up that never transports you to the past.

Some of the trouble is atmospheric. It��s 1981 and New York City is in a state of decay that looks in the burnished tints of movie hindsight almost picturesque. Subway cars blossom with graffiti; the radio news wearily tallies each day��s shootings and stabbings; crime and corruption hang in the winter air like smog." the writer and director of this pulpy meaty altogether terrific new film and Bradford Young its supremely talented director of photography succeed in giving this beat-up version of the city both historical credibility and expressive power. The light is harsh the shadows are dense and forces of chaos seem to gather just outside the frame their presence signaled by Alex Ebert��s anxious musical score. In the course of ���A Most Violent Year �� there is an occasional gunshot and some blood is shed but the violence alluded to in the film��s title is largely a matter of mood rather than action ��� of whispers not noise. We can��t understand Abel a quiet calm man whose good manners seem to sit atop a deep reservoir of fury without a grasp of his environment even if its governing logic is mysterious." both of which are studies in confinement and compression. ���Margin Call�� took place almost entirely inside the offices of an investment firm on a single hectic night. ���All Is Lost�� was about a man alone on a boat in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Compared with them ���A Most Violent Year�� is busy and crowded full of incidental pleasures (including at least a half-dozen memorable bits of character acting notably from Alessandro Nivola Catalina Sandino Moreno Peter Gerety and Jerry Adler) and piquant period details." ruled by a small group of families whose members divide territories and settle disputes according to Mafia-like principles. Abel��s company is expanding but not without significant growing pains.

His trucks are hijacked by armed thugs and one of his drivers (Elyes Gabel) is in particular danger. Abel��s salesmen are not safe as they go from door to door.

It is also the portrait of a brilliant hustler working a very long con. It��s a terrific movie either way." though. Not that there is any doubting Anna��s resolve. It is clear that she can be ruthless in defense of her family��s interests but she is also limited by the patriarchal codes of her milieu.

The movie entwines two old sayings: behind every great man there is a great woman and behind every great fortune there is a great crime." Abel��s wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) whose father used to own the company wonders if her husband has the wherewithal to protect her and their three young daughters. Abel rarely raising his voice or losing his composure takes ostentatious pride in his honest reasonable way of doing business.

Mr. Oyelowo a British actor of Nigerian background has mastered the Southern inflections and preacherly cadences that have become part of the permanent soundtrack of our educational system and the script offers credible paraphrases of his character��s unmatched eloquence.

Dr. King worked in the service of the movement not the other way around and Mr. Oyelowo��s quiet attentive reflective presence upholds this democratic principle by illuminating the contributions of those around him. I have rarely seen a historical film that felt so populous and full of life so alert to the tendrils of narrative that spread beyond the frame." and it is very much a group portrait. We see Dr. King at home in Atlanta with his wife Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) confronting her worries about his safety and her suspicions of his infidelity.

This is not a simple question and it is one that Mr. Burton toys with to intriguing effect.

to say the least. As an ethical touchstone or a political principle it certainly has its dangers. But a lot of great movies including several of Mr. Eastwood��s arise from the simple premise of a fight to the death between good guys and bad guys. ���American Sniper�� is not quite among them but much of its considerable power derives from the clarity and sincerity of its bedrock convictions. Less a war movie than a western ��� the story of a lone gunslinger facing down his nemesis in a dusty lawless place ��� it is blunt and effective though also troubling." which is a political statement in its own right. And though George W. Bush��s name is never invoked ���American Sniper�� can be seen as an expression of nostalgia for his Manichaean approach to foreign policy.

This is less a matter of the way he tells the true story than in the way he edits the history in which it is embedded. Terrorist attacks on United States Embassies in 1998 inspired Chris to enlist and his resolve is fortified when he sees the World Trade Center collapse on Sept. 11 2001. In Iraq his foes are identified only and repeatedly as Al Qaeda." stark view of the order of things one that guides Chris in his subsequent career as a Navy SEAL sniper and one that has with some modification informed much of the work of Clint Eastwood the director of ���American Sniper.�� Faithful in shape and spirit to the real Chris Kyle��s memoir ���American Sniper�� also reaffirms Mr. Eastwood��s commitment to the themes of vengeance and justice in a fallen world. In the universe of his films ��� a universe where the existence of evil is a given ��� violence is a moral necessity albeit one that often exacts a cost from those who must wield it in the service of good." which is not to say that Chris doesn��t suffer. (Mr. Kyle��s death in 2013 at the hands of a disturbed fellow veteran casts a somber shadow over the movie though Mr. Eastwood avoids the obvious trap of using it as a foreshadowing device.) ���American Sniper�� doesn��t flinch from portraying the toll of his service on his psyche and his marriage though it may tidy up the damage a bit too quickly and neatly. But this too is part of the film��s loyalty to its hero��s understanding of himself and his work." though we are in Iraq where Chris Kyle served four tours of duty racking up 160 confirmed kills. He approaches his work with steady nerves and a clear conscience banishing the doubt and fatalism that afflict some of his comrades and buttressed by the unambiguous depravity of his enemies. These are people who use women and children as suicide bombers who mutilate and torture anyone who opposes them who ambush American Marines in the street. Giving them cover is Chris��s nemesis and sinister doppelg�_nger a shadowy sharpshooter rumored to be a Syrian Olympic medalist." which is to say before he grows up into a burly bearded Bradley Cooper Chris Kyle receives a lesson in life from his strict Texan father.

His Chris Kyle is a loyal friend and a brave warrior but Mr. Cooper and Mr. Eastwood working from a script by Jason Hall decline to make him a saint.

Ms. Jolie��s tendency to go David Lean with this material works against her in the camp sequences because what you want to know isn��t what the prisoners looked like standing in formation in long shot but what they thought and did to survive. What the movie ends up in desperate need of is a sense of life made real and palpable through dreadful transporting details not a life embalmed in hagiographic awe. You can find that movie here at times tucked amid the crane shots and angelic singing though mostly in the perverse intimacy that emerges between Louie and the sadistic officer Watanabe (Miyavi) and shows just how personal war can really be." in its human reach and cosmic scale in its different permutations and theaters of war has been recounted in memoirs novels fiction films and all too painfully true documentaries. It emerges again in Laura Hillenbrand��s 2010 best seller ���Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival Resilience and Redemption �� which is the basis for the movie. With some narrative rejigging a lot of compression and one significant exception Ms. Jolie follows the lead of the book which focuses on the first 25 years or so of Mr. Zamperini��s life. She also sweeps through his early education as a peewee gangster truculent son of Italian immigrants and accidental athlete who discovers he can run like the wind but she gets to the war sooner." as a director she leans closer to hell than heaven. She has given herself plenty to work with: The movie takes a slice out of the life of Louis Zamperini the Olympic runner turned World War II bombardier who after surviving a plane crash and 47 days adrift on the Pacific was fished out of the water by a Japanese patrol boat and then imprisoned in camps where he was brutalized for years. His is one of those stories that has come to define the Greatest Generation." she thrusts you inside the claustrophobic confines of a B-24 bomber that��s soon under Japanese attack. There the adult Louie as he was called bounces through the plane while bullets begin shredding its exterior and soon its occupants the fusillade opening little circles of light in the hull as effortlessly as a pencil punches holes in paper. It��s a shrewd opener because it immediately puts you on notice in regard to the story��s life-and-death stakes and draws you close to Louie (the appealing Jack O��Connell). Mr. Zamperini was a distance runner but here he��s a sprinter whose quicksilver movements ��� he crouches and scuttles while tending the wounded plane and men ��� suck you in with gravitational force." of course or make his story any less touching. Being an Olympian is a triumph in and of itself yet that truism doesn��t seem to have been grand enough for Ms. Jolie��s purposes. The Olympic interlude is sandwiched between some wartime scenes right after the plane that Louie��s on starts to malfunction and just before it falls into the Pacific. The placement of his Olympic experience suggests that Louie��s life is flashing before him or that he��s drawing strength from a memory. But the triumphalism of the race is so excessive that it competes with rather than complements the war scenes and ends up being another clip in what increasingly will feel like one man��s extended highlight reel." he��s running laps at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. There he catches a glimpse of Jesse Owens and gawps at the cheering crowds and bloated Nazi spectacle which Ms. Jolie conveys with digital effects and a touch of Leni Riefenstahl pomp-and-creepiness.

Sandra has returned to work only to discover that her position is in danger of disappearing. The company has offered her co-workers a choice: If she is laid off all of them will receive the 1 000 euro ($1 200) bonuses they have long been promised; if they agree to give up the bonuses she can keep her job." One Night�� does not paint a pretty picture of the world as it is now. Partly for that reason ��� and partly because of the gravity and grace of its star ��� it��s a beautiful movie." One Night�� is rated PG-13. Hard times hard feelings." for Sandra and her fellow citizens of the Dardenne Republic is an irreplaceable source of meaning identity and happiness. ���Two Days One Night�� is about the erosion of all of those values and also about the waning of solidarity in the modern economy. In the past the quality of life that workers like Sandra and Manu enjoy might have been secured through collective struggle. Now the film suggests it is maintained through individual competition among the workers themselves." Manu (Fabrizio Rongione) live with their two young children in a clean well-appointed townhouse a big hard-won step up from the ���social housing�� where they used to live. The thought of going back is especially galling to Manu who works in the kitchen of a chain restaurant and who pushes his wife to make her case. Anxious frequently tearful and quick to reach for a Xanax Sandra would rather curl up in bed than endure the humiliation of begging for the pity of her peers." housing projects and modest suburban developments in and around the industrial Belgian cities of Seraing and Li��ge ��� is no place for a movie star. The Dardenne brothers twice winners of the top prize at Cannes practice an austere and democratic style of realism. Their working-class heroes and heroines make their way in stark circumstances their ethical dilemmas and material challenges presented without glamour sentimentality or soundtrack music." but her boss agrees to a second ballot. This gives Sandra a weekend ��� two days and one night as the film��s title says ��� to persuade a majority of her colleagues to make a painful sacrifice on her behalf." unhappy company is played by Marion Cotillard an Oscar winner and glossy-magazine icon makes very little difference apart from the fact that Ms. Cotillard��s performance is as fine a piece of screen acting as you will ever see. It would be facile to say that in ���Two Days One Night �� she disappears into the role of Sandra Bya a working mother fighting to save her job at a small company that makes solar panels or that she accomplishes a breathtaking transformation. Her shoulders slumped her eyes weary her gait heavy Ms. Cotillard moves past naturalism into something impossible to doubt and hard to describe. Sandra is an ordinary person in mundane circumstances but her story plainly and deliberately told is suspenseful sobering and in the original fear-of-God sense of the word tremendous." One Night�� consists almost entirely of encounters between Sandra and the people who have through no choice of their own been given the power to decide her fate. The key to the movie ��� what makes it moving as well as grueling thrilling as well as harsh ��� is that the Dardennes refuse to skip or cut away from a single meeting. Like Sandra the audience must absorb the emotional impact of each conversation. Most begin politely but after the initial handshakes and greetings the reactions to Sandra��s pleas vary wildly. There are anger compassion evasiveness and shame. A man bursts into tears. A fistfight breaks out. A marriage comes undone. A blunt refusal is followed by an offer of orange juice." but the Dardennes never underestimate the importance of money in the lives of their characters. That 1 000 euros will help pay for school tuition for home repairs for children��s clothes and mortgages. Nobody is rich or greedy though some people are perhaps more selfish than others. The leisure of a summer weekend is mostly a time for more work: fixing the car coaching soccer toiling at a second job looking after the kids."

thanks to the exquisite painterly cinematography of Dick Pope see the world as Turner saw it. And as we do an almost alchemical transformation takes place as our various sensory and cognitive impressions merge into a thrilling and powerful form of understanding. By the end we may not be able to summarize Turner��s life explain his paintings or pass a midterm on British history. But we may find that our knowledge of all those things has deepened and the compass by which we measure our own experience has grown wider. Only art can do that and it may be all that art can do." though we might be reading a novel a Victorian triple-decker thick with information about the organizing principles and deep contradictions of a complex civilization. We meet Turner in middle age already successful and living with his cheerful father (Paul Jesson) and Hannah Danby (Dorothy Atkinson) a housekeeper whose patient masochistic devotion is a source of occasional comedy and more frequent pathos." though. ���Mr. Turner�� is a mighty work of critical imagination a loving unsentimental portrait of a rare creative soul. But even as it celebrates a glorious painter and illuminates the sources of his pictures with startling clarity and insight the movie patiently and thoroughly demolishes more than a century��s worth of mythology about what art is and how artists work. You may have had the good fortune to study Turner��s watercolors and martial tableaus up close to linger over his storms and placid river scenes but somehow Mr. Leigh makes it all look newly painted fresh and strange." but Turner shares with Mr. Leigh an ability to travel the circuit between the sublime and the ordinary to bring into view aspects of reality that had been somehow invisible in plain sight. All of Mr. Leigh��s films are personal to the extent that they reflect his sensibility his politics and his ethical concerns but his methods ��� characters and stories developed over many months of rehearsal improvisation and research in collaboration with actors and crew members ��� resist the imposition of a singular authorial vision. He is best known for anatomizing the pervasive indignities and saving graces of modern Britain with particular attention to the low and middle rungs of the class ladder and the stresses and pleasures of family life. Social life for him is what sea air was to Turner: an atmospheric element that becomes a vehicle of meaning and emotion." for sure and all the more so for being uttered by John Ruskin one of the giants of 19th-century British art criticism. But nothing is quite so simple. In ���Mr. Turner ��Mike Leigh��s revelatory new film Ruskin (Joshua McGuire) appears as a pretentious carrot-topped nitwit with a voice like a posh Elmer Fudd. In one scene he offers up ���controversial�� theories about landscapes and seascapes to a roomful of harrumphing artists. It��s all very well one of them says to opine and interpret but unless you have braved the elements with brush in hand you don��t really know what you��re talking about." and suffers when his work falls out of fashion enduring overheard snark from the young Queen Victoria and mockery in a music hall sketch. He welcomes potential buyers and believes that his work should survive him as the property of the British people." semi-estranged wife (Ruth Sheen) and two grown daughters (Sandy Foster and Amy Dawson) though when asked if he has children he replies that he has none. On his visits to Margate where he keeps amorous company with Sophia Booth (Marion Bailey) a kindhearted widow he sheds his identity altogether adopting his lady friend��s last name. The tenderness he shows her is missing from most of his relations with women with the exception of Mary Somerville (Leslie Manville) a Scottish scientist who shares his interest in the properties of light." �� and now Turner in ���Mr. Turner��) extend the range of his sympathy and curiosity into a past that is neither the mirror of the present nor wholly alien to the world as we know it. Turner with his lumbering gait and broad suety face dominates the picture seeming to personify his age and all its contradictions. His speech is a symphony of growls snorts and flights of guttural eloquence. As he traipses from London to the seaside town of Margate and back paces in his studio and prowls the galleries of the Royal Academy we witness an act of creation that seems more sculptural than cinematic as if Mr. Spall and Mr. Leigh were molding Turner in molten bronze." J. M. W. Turner ��� the Ruskin of Mr. Leigh��s film is a cruelly etched cautionary figure a warning that even those people most passionately devoted to the cause of art are likely to get it wrong. A bit of well-placed cynicism might even be in order." played with blunt brutish grunting delicacy by Timothy Spall is both a genius and an ordinary man with the usual emotions and appetites. His art does not arise from any special torment or trauma though he has his share of unhappiness. Nor is the unhappiness he inflicts on others ��� women in particular ��� excused as the prerogative of talent. The son of a barber Turner takes a disciplined businesslike artisanal approach to his vocation and even though he often seems gripped by an almost otherworldly inspiration he and his art belong very much to the everyday world. With other artists Turner is convivial collegial and competitive. He is conscious of his celebrity protective of his reputation and tireless in his labor."

that small thrown rock instigates a series of spiraling crises that set owner against tenant man against man paralyzing convictions against destabilizing doubts. Each action begets an inevitable reaction sometimes in the form of a raised eyebrow or clenched fist although more often in long often barbed impeccably orchestrated conversations that turn intimates into combatants. These words don��t merely jab and sting they drip drip drip into ears like Iago��s pestilence an association that Mr. Ceylon obviously sought to suggest when he named Aydin��s high castle with its servants and stony fortifications Hotel Othello. ���Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons �� Iago asserts ones that ���burn like the mines of sulfur.��" Ebru Ceylan ���Winter Sleep�� unfolds over more than three hours in three distinct movements the first involving Aydin and an impoverished family that lives in one of his properties. Its youngest member Ilyas (Emirhan Doruktutan) a boy of around 11 throws a rock at Aydin��s S.U.V. shortly after the story opens shattering a window. With his driver Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan) Aydin brings the boy back to the family��s rundown house which is nestled into an enormous rocky slab. As he scans the jumble scattered outside the home a look of disgust spreads across his face a sentiment that turns into a public article of faith when this nonreligious privileged man writes an editorial linking godliness with cleanliness." �� a speck of a man can be seen in long shot dwarfed by the staggering natural beauty that envelops him like an embrace.

He spends much of his time in a gloomily lit home office ��� at times alone in near-monastic quiet at times with bitingly effusive company ��� writing editorials about a world from which he has largely retreated." shrieking fire there isn��t much that burns in ���Winter Sleep �� despite some of its first-rate smolderers including the boy��s father Ismail (Nejat Isler). He has plenty to get worked up about as does Aydin��s wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen) a beauty with moist lashes and a Modigliani neck who��s nursing a grudge against her husband. In one of the movie��s missteps she makes the case against him with the detail of a forensic psychologist testifying against a criminal defendant. Much like a wild horse that��s brought to its knees in one scene Nihal too often serves as a dispensary of obvious meaning a disappointment given that Mr. Ceylan is a master of ellipses and the quietly devastating moment." Aydin and his sister Necla (Demet Akbag) discuss the editorials he writes a conversation that builds ��� with icy observations nonchalant cruelty and Aydin��s unsettling punctuating little laughs ��� into a portrait of mutual hostility and contempt. Again and again Aydin laughs at the wrong time for the wrong reason. He chuckles when he offers his hand to a contrite tenant and again when his wife weeps. You can hear the arrogance in these small hollow-sounding snickers and chortles the titanic ignorance and the irony too. Yet despite Mr. Bilginer��s dug-in performance and the haunting grandeur of Aydin��s world this is finally a character too small to see." man of leisure bourgeois conformist imperious landlord bad brother worse husband ��� that speck Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) takes on a series of overlapping roles in ���Winter Sleep �� which was directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. In genre terms the movie can be classed as a character study although it often plays more like one of those spiritual autopsies that directors occasionally perform on their protagonists gutting them with degrees of gravity glee and precision and extracting flaws like diseased organs.

But can a weeklong vacation from each other refresh a marriage that has been going sour for years?" after the passion has cooled when tiny irritants that once were tolerated threaten to turn into toxic infections. In Sophie Filli��res��s ���If You Don��t I Will �� the French stars Emmanuelle Devos and Mathieu Amalric portray such a couple with a subtlety and depth that let you glimpse their rich shared history as well as their dismal present." wide-eyed gaze conveys a lurking sense of alarm while Ms. Devos��s heavy-lidded eyes and drooping mouth suggest a sensual woman with submerged layers of disappointment and despair. When she pressures Pierre to dance with her at a party he glares at her throws up his hands and refuses." Pierre��s unconscious desire to escape his wife prompts him to board a bus without checking to see if she is right behind him and she is nearly left at the curb. Pomme who suspects that Pierre may be having an affair with a younger TV weather reporter remarks ���You don��t love me anymore �� in a tone so offhand that he doesn��t bother to respond." who is recovering from surgery for a benign brain tumor makes the first move. The two enjoy hiking in the woods and on one of their forays into the wild she impetuously decides to venture off on her own leaving Pierre looking aghast as she disappears. As the days pass and she doesn��t return Pierre does nothing until their college-age son Romain (Nelson Delapalme) suggests that Pierre should deal with a situation that he believes is serious. Although Pierre returns to the woods and begins searching for Pomme you wonder if he is just going through the motions."

Lana and Nico the director Alexandre Rockwell turns ���Little Feet�� into a whimsical exploration of loss transformed by magical thinking." the siblings set off to find some water and perhaps a new mate for their pet. Their picaresque journey photographed in shimmering black and white by Mr. Rockwell and David Walter Lech transforms innocence into a cloak against the random dangers of the adult world. So eloquently does Mr. Rockwell evoke the joy of adventure and the solace of imagination that his film would work in virtual silence; the enchantment of the siblings�� worldview pervades every frame." ���Little Feet�� is a quixotic poem to youthful resourcefulness. Dead and absent parents haunt the movie��s margins but they don��t weigh it down; as Nico knows his mother��s spirit is as likely to be found in the flight of a feather as at the bottom of a fishbowl." Lana cares for her 4-year-old brother Nico and her recently widowed father (Mr. Rockwell) who disappears most nights into a drunken stupor. So when one of the children��s two pet fish dies they process its passing like that of their mother without adult mediation; what matters to Lana and Nico is the happiness of its surviving partner."

illusions about men women God and country are manufactured which are often harshly at odds with the city��s off-screen reality. Mr. Anderson nods to the complex relationship between those real-life and representational histories folding in march-of-time moments alongside evocations of Robert Altman��s ���The Long Goodbye.�� The one place where Mr. Anderson��s film slips is in a strip scene that��s straight from the book and is at once bleak ��� the woman disrobing confesses to selling herself out ��� and a fantasy of female erotic power. It��s a beautifully staged and played interlude but also the one time when Mr. Anderson is himself seduced by an illusion. It harshed my mellow." the story opens with a slinky number Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston) sliding into Doc��s beach shack all Ali MacGraw hair and come-hither murmurings. Like the wild young thing in Raymond Chandler��s ���The Big Sleep �� the one who calls Marlowe cute Shasta has been hanging around with the usual shady characters. One Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts) a real-estate developer and serial philanderer has mysteriously gone missing. Shasta thinks this could be bad news (Wolfmann has a wife and she has a lover) and asks Doc to find out what happened a request that sends him down assorted narrative byways tangled freeways and bottomless rabbit holes sometimes in an abused Dodge Dart." the L.A.P.D. belong to another story about Los Angeles one that didn��t need Charles Manson for a villain. It��s a story that��s been told in narratives about Chavez Ravine a largely Mexican-American neighborhood demolished by the city that became the home of Dodger Stadium and in films like Charles Burnett��s ���Killer of Sheep �� a masterpiece about a black family in 1970s South-Central. At one point Doc drives down to South-Central (now called South Los Angeles) and with the camera riding alongside him looks out at some black children racing alongside his car an image that echoes one in Mr. Burnett��s film. Soon after Doc seems to be hallucinating a line of men ��� like Indians in a western ��� running through the flatlands like ghosts." as well as in and out of homes offices and states of being. He��s nudged in one direction by an ex-con Tariq Khalil (Michael Kenneth Williams) and steered in another by an ex-heroin addict Hope Harlingen (Jena Malone). She introduces a second missing man her husband Coy (Owen Wilson) former needle user and saxophonist turned snitch who works for anti-subversive concerns including some Republican activists and Nixon boosters called Vigilant California. The two missing men aren��t missing for long and mostly function as doppelg�_ngers ��� one rich and master of his universe the other poor and apparent slave of his ��� who with another matched set help establish the dialectical lay of this contested land." a Los Angeles son and its reigning cinema laureate knows California��s plagues and pleasures well. His films are filled with its light and malevolent forces its faith healers and dream peddlers. Bodies writhe like Cecil B. DeMille extras in ���Boogie Nights �� in which a pornutopia is found and lost while a prophet rises in ���Magnolia�� with a Kubrickian flourish. In ���There Will Be Blood �� an oil speculator who sounds like John Huston (it��s Chinatown Jake) gushes crude and blood; in ���The Master �� a religion is born on the bodies of broken men. (Psst it��s Scientology.) Like some filmic equivalent of Kevin Starr the pre-eminent historian of California Mr. Anderson tells the state��s story with big-picture sweep intellectual cool and unforced sympathy." �� Joaquin Phoenix plays Doc Sportello a Los Angeles shamus in Jesus sandals trucking through the sunshine and noir like a stoner Philip Marlowe. Based on the 2009 Thomas Pynchon novel the film is set in 1970 the year after Charles Manson freaked the city out and its good vibrations faded into an endless summer bummer. That��s the gospel according to Joan Didion at any rate who in ���The White Album�� writes that many people she knew believed the 1960s ended Aug. 9 1969 the day the Manson Family began its Helter Skelter frenzy. Somehow Doc a hippie crowned in a halo of pot smoke never got the message." Bigfoot Bjornsen (a terrific Josh Brolin) Doc��s tormentor and secret sharer who with him completes the story��s other set of doppelg�_ngers. A thick coil of muscle almost bursting Bluto-like from his overly snug undertaker suits Bigfoot wears a flattop so sharply planed it looks like a slice of his head was left on the barbershop floor. He��s a cartoonish villain but a serious threat as well as a figure of sneaky pathos. Much like Kevin Spacey��s character in ���L.A. Confidential �� Bigfoot earns extra cash working in the entertainment industry and pops up on Doc��s television both in a real-estate commercial and as an extra in ���Adam-12 �� the show that with ���Dragnet �� helped whitewash the Police Department��s reputation." his jaw slacking with bafflement or wonderment sometimes both. With his head of laid-back angel curls and Neil Young mutton chops ��� the excellent playlist includes several of Mr. Young��s songs ��� Doc comes across as a counterculture holdout the last of the pre-Manson hippies. He takes an occasional deep snort (he generally goes with the flow) but his drug of choice is pot. That helps distinguish him from the speed freaks and pill poppers but his hippy M.O. (beach shack Army jacket dirty feet marijuana haze) also sets him apart from the straight world from Wolfmann Fenway and the guardians of their galaxy the Los Angeles Police Department." with its listing palm trees and choking smog ��� is the brass ring in this classic California tale of land grabbers like Wolfmann and power mongers like Crocker Fenway (Martin Donovan). Fenway has his own problems including a missing stash and an errant daughter Japonica (Sasha Pieterse) who��s mixed up with a corrupt dentist Rudy Blatnoyd (Martin Short delivering a comic master class in clammy desperation). Fenway appears late in the proceedings his pale face rising vampirelike from the murk. There��s a touch of Brando��s Godfather to his entrance too except that the old-money Fenway is scarier than any new-immigrant threat. ���People like you �� Fenway sneers to Doc ���lose all claim to respect the first time they pay anybody rent.��" in other words for the site-specific ���Inherent Vice �� Mr. Pynchon��s third novel set in California. Mr. Anderson has condensed the book with surgical precision ditching certain subplots characters and locales while retaining the novel��s sociopolitical tug barbed asides and chokingly funny details. In a nice genre twist he has also added a female narrator Joanna Newsom as Sortil��ge who helps offset all the peekaboo miniskirts. Mr. Phoenix��s note-perfect performance flows on the story��s currents of comedy that occasionally turn into rapids as the funny ha-ha funny strange back-and-forth abruptly gives way to Three Stooges slapstick: a bonk on the head a kick in the rear a fired gun a busted-down door.

�� Wim Wenders��s new documentary about the life and work of the Brazilian photographer Sebasti�o Salgado elegantly inhabits a moral and aesthetic paradox. Mr. Salgado��s photographs illuminate some of the worst horrors of the modern world: starvation war poverty displacement. They are also beautiful dramatic visual artifacts and their power has a double effect. We are drawn into the contemplation of terrible realities but at the same time our attention turns to the person bearing witness." Mr. Salgado set out to document unexplored aspects of human life often focusing on remote areas and vulnerable or exploited people. ���The Salt of the Earth�� begins with the contemplation of pictures taken in and around an enormous open gold mine a crowded infernal place in which Mr. Salgado��s camera discovers humanity in its raw desperate essence." for his part occupies the screen with quiet charisma.

Susan Sontag��s 2003 book ���Regarding the Pain of Others�� explores the ways that photographs of atrocities can both awaken and dull the conscience creating a sense of immediacy that is also inevitably a measure of the distance between the sufferer and the observer. ���The Salt of the Earth �� a document of Mr. Wenders��s admiration for his subject largely avoids such complications: a perfectly defensible choice but also something of a lost opportunity. ���The Salt of the Earth�� leaves no doubt about Mr. Salgado��s talent or decency and the chance to spend time in his company is a reason for gratitude. And yet his pictures precisely because they disclose harsh and unwelcome truths deserve a harder more robustly critical look." either in Mr. Salgado��s lifelong project or in Mr. Wenders��s consideration of it. It��s just a fact of their common vocation.

What is most audacious about the film directed by Jean-Marc Vall�e (���Dallas Buyers Club��) from a screenplay by Nick Hornby (yes that Nick Hornby) is how closely it follows and how fully it respects Ms. Strayed��s free-associative memory-driven narrative. In its thrilling disregard for the conventions of commercial cinematic storytelling ���Wild�� reveals what some of us have long suspected: that plot is the enemy of truth and that images and emotions can carry meaning more effectively than neatly packaged scenes or carefully scripted character arcs." a trek of over 1 000 miles along the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail from the Southern California desert to the lush forests of Oregon. Based on Cheryl Strayed��s best-selling memoir the film begins like the book in the middle of the journey with a scene that at once celebrates the sublimity of nature and the spirit of solitude and douses such romanticism in a demystifying spray of cold water." written in a frank funny voice that only occasionally drifts into clouds of self-help abstraction is a complicated blend of grief memoir and travelogue.

The story ���Wild�� has to tell is partly about how Cheryl deals with hardship and about how following a piece of long-ago maternal advice she learns to put herself ���in the way of beauty.�� But it is also about her appetite for difficulty and her insistence on confronting ugliness inside and out." who appears in nearly every frame of ���Wild.�� The overstuffed backpack she hoists onto her shoulders is a metaphor not only for the baggage the character is carrying but also for the scale of the actress��s undertaking. It is clear from the beginning that her task is not to make us like Cheryl but to help us understand her. And since Cheryl doesn��t understand herself ��� she can��t really say why she��s on the Pacific Crest Trail in the first place ��� a certain amount of patience will be required. We are not going to be charmed teased flattered or befriended.

Those words crystallize some of the film��s ideas while its feelings are carried along on a current of music: a well-timed Grateful Dead cover; hummed and whistled snatches of ���El Condor Pasa �� by Simon and Garfunkel; and an unexpected a cappella ballad that delivers a clean and overwhelming catharsis near the end." some of them scary some of them kind almost all of them intrigued by the presence of a solitary woman so far from civilization ��� dissolve into montages of memory.

Or rather until I came home from the screening went to bed and woke up in the throes of the kind of nightmare that was the reason I had shunned those books in the first place." longing resentment and all kinds of other emotional baggage. Somehow Ms. Kent has folded all of this into a highly effective little ghost story one that is as simple and austere as the Babadook book itself. The off-kilter camera angles echoing sound effects and lurid cinematography (by Radek Ladczuk) certainly help and so do the two lead actors.

this film might have felt radical and counterintuitive like a daring inspired leap from one era to another or an excavation of the hidden history of the present. Instead it has the shiny hollow ring of conventional wisdom. It��s kind of perfect and also kind of stale." ���The Imitation Game�� is a parable of disruption. It not only provides an origin myth for the digital age but it also projects the ideology of the present back into the past. Turing an eccentric visionary stuck in an organization that is bureaucratic hierarchical and wedded to tradition is an apostle of innovation. Commander Denniston lectures him about the importance of ���order discipline and chain of command�� for the war effort but the solving of Enigma decisively rebuts this old-fashioned notion. The strategic acumen of generals and the tactical valor of soldiers is incidental. What won the war was data and the heroes were the tech guys (and the one woman) who worked late snacked freely fiddled with crossword puzzles and geeked out over a piece of hardware that looked like a giant toy. Hut 8 at Bletchley Park serves as a prototype for the corporate campuses of Apple Google and Facebook." but also not hugely insightful ��� is as a land of understatement indirection and steadfast obedience to norms of behavior that seem to a fiercely logical mind like Turing��s arbitrary and incomprehensible.

The head of Bletchley Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) finds him insufferable as does Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) the suave clever playboy who runs the Enigma project until Turing with an off-screen assist from Winston Churchill displaces him." enlivened by the indispensably charming Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke the only woman on the Enigma team is the heart of the film though it is also the most familiar and in some ways the least challenging part.

The film interweaves three decisive periods in Turing��s life using his interrogation by a Manchester detective (Rory Kinnear) as a framing device. Turing tells the investigator ��� who thinks he is after a Soviet spy rather than a gay man ��� about what he did during the war. Later there are flashbacks to Turing��s school days where he discovered the joys of cryptography and fell in love with a slightly older boy named Christopher Morcom." �� meanwhile settles for a partial appreciation. Turing��s sexuality is mystified and marginalized treated as an abstraction and a plot point. There is no sense that between his chaste intense and brief passion for Christopher and the anonymous encounter that led indirectly to his arrest love sex or romance played any significant part in Turing��s life at all. Mr. Hodges��s biography threaded with quotations from Walt Whitman gives eloquent and sensitive testimony to the contrary. For their part the filmmakers though willing to treat Turing as a victim of bigotry and repression also nudge him back toward the closet imposing a discretion that is at once self-protective and self-congratulatory. It��s not that we need to see him having sex ��� the PG-13 rating must be protected I guess ��� but that a vital aspect of his identity and experience deserves more than a whisper and a wink." all in all a very welcome thing. Chances are that you are reading this as I am writing it on a device that came into being partly as a result of papers Turing published in the 1930s exploring the possibility of what he called a ���universal machine.�� His decisive contribution to the breaking of the Nazi Enigma code gave the Allied forces an intelligence advantage that helped defeat Germany though the extent of his wartime role was kept secret for many years.

He can perceive patterns invisible to others but also finds himself stranded in the desert of the literal. Jokes fly over his head sarcasm does not register and when one of his colleagues says ���We��re going to get some lunch �� Turing hears a trivial statement of fact rather than a friendly invitation." but in other respects it is very much a document of the present. There are lines of dialogue that sound either anachronistic or ��� it may amount to the same thing ��� prophetic. It is thrilling and strange to hear the words ���digital computer�� uttered a half-century before any such thing existed and when Turing says ���think differently �� it is impossible not to hear a grammatically fastidious premonition of the once-ubiquitous Apple advertising slogan. Another sentence ��� a slightly clumsy invocation of the power of imagination ��� is repeated three times and sounds each time as if it had been plagiarized from a TED talk." bristling with ideas and present-day implications and it benefits from the streamlined structure and accessible presentation of modern prestige cinema.

Only gradually did Ms. Schwartz now 37 begin to suspect what might seem obvious to an outsider: that her biological father was black." but the movie goes one step further by charting the effect that Ms. Schwartz��s transformation has on her family members and the awkward sense in which her embrace of a biracial identity might be seen as a repudiation of them.

Or do you stay in touch with your homeland like Yannick (the novelist Edwidge Danticat) the oldest of Micheline��s two daughters; she��s a teacher and political activist who remained in Haiti after Micheline left.

the boundary-smashing butch goddess of dystopian cinema acts in a propaganda video. The idea is for Katniss who��s both the spark of a revolution and its flinty strength to rouse the masses with a heroic scene. Slicked up in lipstick and a Joan of Arc breastplate she delivers her lines ��� ���with energy �� the video director hopefully instructs her ��� but the scene needs tweaks. Eventually they get it right and the video ends with a call to ���join the fight �� an exhortation that��s clearly addressed to more than one audience. It��s a funny self-aware moment given how extreme the stakes have become in this fascinating and strange pop epic." which makes the movie feel far more claustrophobic than its antecedents. To an extent since the rebel leaders are strategizing from a bunker the sense of entrapment works for the story as do the physical limitations presented by District 13 which is underground and organized around a dimly lit multilevel atrium that looks like a repurposed silo. Yet you grow antsy in District 13 both because it��s such a dreary militarized world ��� created for maximum defensiveness and that��s it ��� and because it locks up Katniss who was made to roam. It��s a relief when she steps outside even to go hunting with her best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) whose moony lovesick shtick has become a drag." the off-screen battlegrounds have shifted but Ms. Davidson��s take remains as valid as ever. And ���Mockingjay Part 1�� is indisputably a war movie from tearful start to unsettling end. Its director is Francis Lawrence who did the honors in the second one and he does a serviceable job again of pulling the parts together. If you haven��t seen the earlier movies you may get a little lost; it doesn��t matter. If you��ve watched them and forgotten certain details it also doesn��t matter. ���Mockingjay Part 1�� is streamlined blunt and easy. The Capitol the base of Panem power is after Katniss who is squirreled away in a part of the country District 13 once thought to have been destroyed. Led by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore equal parts iron and silk) District 13 is now leading the charge against the Capitol." most obviously) often come stuffed with the best acting talent money can buy. The script for ���Mockingjay Part 1 �� credited to Peter Craig and Danny Strong gets the job done but the performers matter far more than the words they deliver. When Ms. Moore sits around a table with Jeffrey Wright (as Beetee a tech whiz) and Philip Seymour Hoffman (Plutarch a strategist) you��re both watching a scene and seeing how great actors can give emotional and psychological specificity to blather about the art of war and the fate of a people. Hoffman who looked so uncomfortable in ���Catching Fire �� is here loose funny and stingingly real." including as an allegory for the agonies of adolescence but on screen those interpretations have receded as the series has unfolded and the story��s focus has sharpened. When the curtain rises on the third movie (the full unwieldy title is ���The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1��) the games are over and the subject of the series ��� war ��� has been revealed. Though of course it��s been there all along as Amy Davidson wrote in The New Yorker on the eve of the first movie��s release in 2012: ���America has been at war for a decade now; is it really a coincidence that the biggest movie of the year is the first in a trilogy in which torture terror asymmetric warfare and the manipulation of public opinion all play a role?��" thumping and sometimes racing in a franchise that more than most industrial movies and even putative indies speaks to both its audience and its time. There��s heart in the vague yet stirring liberation story that comes to the fore in this chapter and that��s echoed in real-life struggles around the world. And it��s there of course in Katniss the backwoods savior who as played with guileless appeal by Jennifer Lawrence is mounting an attack on the forces of oppression." which considering that 85 percent of the top-grossing movies from 2013 have male leads means most of the people making films. But there��s more here than gender equality. Last year the second installment ���The Hunger Games: Catching Fire �� topped the year��s box office. It��s easy to see why. ���Mockingjay Part 1�� returns to the series backdrop: a totalitarian country ��� Panem a stand-in for any number of nations ��� that rose from the ashes of a postapocalyptic North America. Katniss has surmounted her station as a slave by emerging victorious from the annual gladiatorial games that pit (usually child) combatants against one another. Her very survival has made her an existential threat to Panem." etc. ��� which is complicated. Fran�_ois Truffaut is said to have observed that there��s no such thing as an antiwar movie because all war movies make combat look fun which isn��t true even if many turn death into easy-to-consume spectacles. ���The Hunger Games�� has never been antiwar and while some object to a fiction in which adults send children to slaughter one another what��s truly appalling is that this isn��t a grotesque fantasy but a bitter truth of human civilization. The scene in the first movie of combatants racing into the start of the games to kill and die is shocking only because it acknowledges that truth." but the ugliness of those deaths was mitigated by Katniss whose very individuality her grit roughness and decency serve as a rebuke to the Capitol. In her struggle to keep herself alive along with her other love interest the insufferably dull Peeta (Josh Hutcherson still miscast!) Katniss personalizes ��� humanizes ��� the fight. That humanity is crucial to her evolution as a classic charismatic revolutionary hero. She��s the one who embodies articulates and justifies the battle and breaks collective chains even as she��s being folded into District 13��s militaristic operation. Plutarch and the rest of the rebel leaders understand that but when they make that first propaganda video they get it wrong because by writing the script for her they also silence her." but in some respects it sidelines her. She still has plenty to say and do though not enough partly because in chopping the last book into two movies (���Part 2�� lands next year) and by embracing the blockbuster imperative ��� big bangs and action ��� the filmmakers lose sight of her. That��s most evident with a rescue that Katniss doesn��t physically participate in. The rescue happens midway through the final book but it��s been turned into the movie��s culminating set piece one that Katniss ��� like you ��� witnesses unfold on screen. It��s perfectly watchable in a generic action-flick way. Yet as Katniss Everdeen stands gaping at the rescue with widening and watering eyes it��s hard not to feel that for the first time in this series the filmmakers are treating her just like well the girl."

Whatever the inspiration the kid is just one of a number of character types drifting through Ms. Amirpour��s cinematic fun house." this black-and-white movie opens with a male beauty Arash (Arash Marandi) a gardener who��s been dolled up to resemble James Dean but looks more like a James Franco cousin. Wearing a T-shirt and jeans his hair flopping prettily Arash is posed in a desolate vista that brings to mind ���Giant �� the 1956 wide-screen soap in which James Dean pines for Elizabeth Taylor through a fog of complications and under a coat of crude oil. (It may summon up Texas but everyone speaks Persian which produces a mild estrangement effect.) Arash doesn��t appear terribly tortured though he��s burdened by his addict father Hossein (Marshall Manesh) a swamp of misery indebted to a pimp Saeed (Dominic Rains)." including a prostitute Atti (Mozhan Marno) and a rich woman a so-called princess Shaydah (Rome Shadanloo). For the most part however Ms. Amirpour in her feature directing debut spends her time switching between Arash and the Girl whose lives unfold on nearly parallel story tracks that ��� detail by detail incident by incident ��� gradually converge. In one scene the pimp seizes Arash��s Thunderbird to help satisfy Hossein��s debt; in another the Girl watches as the pimp hunkered down in the Thunderbird threateningly shakes down the prostitute. Time and again the relationships in the movie are defined by the exchange of money and the tremors and eruptions of violence that invariably accompany its circulation." Calif. and she has obviously watched her share of Sergio Leone westerns. She can fill a wide-screen frame and if you don��t mind narrative repetition and passages in which nothing much happens beyond pretty people staring at other pretty people you may not mind that she has trouble filling this overlong movie which comes in at 107 minutes when 70 would have done nicely. Still she gives you much to look at including an image that looks like Madonna (it��s Margaret Atwood!) on the Girl��s wall that suggests that time (and life) stopped for the vampire in the 1980s. The image reflects the movie��s humor and feminism and suggests Ms. Amirpour��s complex relationship to appropriation." which conjures up the ���Papa Don��t Preach�� music video in which Madonna wears a shirt and a pixie do borrowed from Jean Seberg. The video is a model of pop-culture intertextuality that makes a virtue out of its wide-ranging sampling and much of its fun came from peeling its thickly layered influences. Something similar initially seems at work in ���A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.�� This is a movie that after all invites you to play a game of Name That Allusion with Dean Leone and so forth. Yet even as Ms. Amirpour draws heavily from various bodies of work with vampirelike hunger she gives her influences new life by channeling them through other cultural forms including her chador-cloaked vampire. The Girl isn��t actually alone: She has lots and lots of company."

Mr. Serra��s immersive period film might be a lost chapter from Casanova��s memoirs and this eccentric filmmaker too goes way beyond conventional expectations. The opening candlelit alfresco banquet set in Switzerland sets a suitable tone given the notorious 18th-century libertine��s appetites. But rather than serial romances pursued across the Continent much of what follows consists of desultory pleasures enjoyed by Casanova at home and later affairs with servants at a Carpathian boarding house." an apparition of the gothic in Casanova��s playground of life. There��s no lunging dueling between legends or arterial spray as this Dracula (Eliseu Huertas) fits the mold of a fleeting wraith bellowing after a bloody drink but embodying a mood as much as a myth." but the film��s lived-in feel does make for one vivid way of imagining shifts in thought." slurping down oysters and fruit and giggling over acts of defecation (his own ���gifts�� and others��). Letting darkness fall where it may and conversations linger the filmmaker gets inside unfiltered experience as he did with the travails of Don Quixote in ���Honor of the Knights�� (which amounted to a series of drolly hilarious blackout sketches) and the Three Wise Men in ���Birdsong.��" but Mr. Serra notably resists the pull of his idol��s confessional storytelling (and isn��t as witty). ���Story of My Death�� is no adaptation and it��s free to grow opaque quite literally with a lot of elliptical dimly lit t��te-��-t��tes involving Casanova (Vicen�_ Altai�_ a poet and critic) or his servant Pompeu (Llu�_s Serrat who played Sancho Panza in ���Honor��). As nightfall appears to drop permanently on the film lovely guitar strumming on the soundtrack is replaced by rumbling drum rolls." each held for the fixed camera into an all-encompassing saturnine poem of darkness.

The dueling hairstyles suggest an inner conflict between conformity and individuality in a restrictive environment.

painful interviews with Paterno��s widow and two of his sons and with Matt Sandusky Jerry Sandusky��s adopted son who offers a harrowing glimpse into the household of a serial pedophile. There are conversations with critics and partisans of Penn State and its football team including a student who thinks the punishment of the university went much too far and a lawyer who believes it did not go far enough." especially as articulated in a report overseen by Louis J. Freeh the former director of the F.B.I. only deepened the sense of crisis at Penn State. Suspicions about Mr. Sandusky had been raised as early as 1998 but nothing was done. The N.C.A.A. banned the team from bowl games and nullified all victories from 1998 to 2011 taking away Paterno��s status as the most winning coach in major college football." and a statue of Paterno a landmark for fans and tourists will be uprooted from its place outside the football stadium. The cause of this downfall is well known far beyond Central Pennsylvania. In 2012 Jerry Sandusky a longtime defensive coach under Paterno was convicted on 45 counts related to the sexual abuse of children. Mr. Sandusky had used his charity which ostensibly helped poor and vulnerable youngsters as a way of finding and grooming victims and camouflaging his crimes in good works." �� which recounts the sorry tale of his trial and its aftermath. His monstrousness has been amply documented in Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting by Sara Ganim and others at The Patriot-News in Harrisburg Pa. and in exhaustive sometimes prurient coverage on national television. Mr. Bar-Lev whose other documentaries include ���The Tillman Story�� and ���My Kid Could Paint That �� is more interested in the storm of shame denial and anger ��� the crisis of faith ��� that washed over State College as attention turned from Mr. Sandusky to the team and the university administration. Did anyone know that a sexual predator was at large in the football program using its prestige to his own despicable ends? Did anyone try to stop him?" �� even as it revisits past events has a chilling timeliness. Mr. Sandusky��s crimes are his alone but there are enough other scandals related to college sports to suggest a pattern of dysfunction. Big-time college sports represent an area of American culture where democratic values give way to other more atavistic impulses: the worship of authority the celebration of discipline and conformity the absorption of the individual��s voice into the roar of the crowd. Societies where statues are erected in honor of living people and then pulled down in disgrace are not usually happy places." including the campus riot the night after Paterno��s firing when students knocked down lampposts and upended cars. A strain of self-pitying defensiveness is evident among Penn State loyalists who defiantly chant Paterno��s name at gatherings and ritualistically blame ���the media�� for the university��s woes." �� Amir Bar-Lev��s powerful new documentary frequently describe Penn State football as a religion. This is almost not a metaphor. The film pays periodic visits to a large outdoor mural in State College Pa. where Nittany Lion luminaries are depicted as if they were figures in an Italian Renaissance tableau of biblical luminaries. At one point a halo is painted in over the head of Joe Paterno the former Penn State head football coach who died in 2012 a few months after being fired from the position he had held for 46 seasons. Mr. Bar-Lev��s interview subjects sometimes describe Paterno as a god or a saint and he is almost universally recalled as a beloved and benevolent patriarch." which is at once an isolated enclave of sports fanaticism and a symbol for other such places. The cult of personality around Paterno ��� a man paradoxically hailed as a deity and praised for his modesty ��� is hardly unique. In many states the highest-paid public employee coaches a college football or basketball team. At the end of ���Happy Valley �� we see merchandise featuring the name and likeness of Paterno��s successor Bill O��Brien (who has since left for the N.F.L.)."

She has no clue about Dev.) Soon Dev buries his gun and declares to his buddy Tutu (Mr. Zafar) and the heavens ���I��m tired of being bad.��" a grade-school dropout has trouble finding work in the sleek office towers of the new economy. When he finally lands a job his rickety office has pictures of Gandhi on the wall. And Dev and Tutu��s living quarters ��� on a roof with a view of a highway overpass where the sky is always a muted polluted yellow ��� might as well be in a different city from Disha��s glamorously suburban digs." and one memorable stakes-clarifying dance sequence that juxtaposes two styles: the macho moves of the criminals (led by Govinda) and the alluringly feminine ones of Disha��s world where Dev is playing hooky. It��s easy to know which side to root for." ���Kill Dil�� is a production of Yash Raj Films which mostly churns out candy-coated tales set in a fantasy India. But Mr. Ali��s movie has glimmers of reality and even of a social conscience." its twists are worth considering. In the opening sequences we meet two orphaned boys raised on the wrong side of the law (���breast fed on gulps of blood��). They quickly grow up to be killers played by movie stars (Ranveer Singh and Ali Zafar underused in a glowering change-of-pace role) their hair bouncing prettily as they run from crime to crime." ���Kill Dil�� asks the audience to admire its heroes�� outlaw gumption. But after the shoot-��em-up opener the movie stops wanting us to applaud their violence."

too is a haunting figure an enigmatic alloy of decency selfishness murderous rage and tenderness. Originally the film��s exaggerated folkloric comic spark he winds up as its reality principle and the bearer of its tragic weight. It may take time to absorb the sorrow of ���The Homesman �� to appreciate the odd rhythms and jarring surprises of its plot and to grasp its unsettling ideas about the American West and the larger civilization that conquered it. The movie shows us a cruel and beautiful place where grit is rewarded and goodness is betrayed where venality and righteousness coexist and are sometimes hard to tell apart. A place that might look like home." which encounters some of the usual western trouble ��� a lawless gunslinger a band of Indians bad weather ��� as well as some less familiar problems. Mr. Jones��s primary interest is in the two main characters who at first look like archetypal figures but evolve into complex vulnerable unpredictable human beings. Ms. Swank starts out emphasizing Mary Bee��s strength and stoicism her acceptance of disappointment and her natural courage. At the end we are left with a sadder more enigmatic picture. Mary Bee who once annoyed Briggs now haunts him." by two different men both spurning her offer of marriage ��� are ���bossy�� and ���plain.�� The point of ���The Homesman �� directed by Tommy Lee Jones and based on Glendon Swarthout��s novel of the same name is not that these adjectives are inappropriate. Ms. Swank is about as far from plain as it��s possible for a human being to be. The point is that even in situations where toughness is paramount and survival is at stake a woman will still be judged by her looks and her docility." Mary Bee ��� walking behind a mule-drawn plow tending livestock making supper and playing silent music on an embroidery keyboard ��� evokes the world of John Ford. She has carried civilization into the wilderness and in the face of adversity has upheld its values of cleanliness godliness and culture. Briggs on the other hand arrives on the scene in a literal blast of Looney Tunes slapstick. After a bomb is sent down his chimney he stumbles into the frame in his long johns covered in soot a plume of smoke rising from his disheveled head. It��s as if Yosemite Sam had turned up in the pages of a Willa Cather novel." unforgiving stretch of the American frontier in the decade before the Civil War ���The Homesman�� is both a captivating western and a meticulous devastating feminist critique of the genre. Mr. Jones who rides alongside Ms. Swank as a whiskery ruffian known as Briggs uses western iconography to dismantle a familiar set of romantic myths. Most basically the journey Briggs and Mary Bee undertake is not further into the West but back toward the East. It is a trek that originates in failure passes through frustration and concludes on ambiguous notes of sorrow resignation and cynicism." Mr. Jones is well within his comfort zone playing an irascible old coot. As a director he is both canny and bold dropping bits of backwoods humor into an austere landscape dominated by violence and anguish. (This is his second feature after ���The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.��) The reason Briggs and Mary Bee are headed back across the river to Iowa is that three local women have gone mad and need to be brought back home. The causes of their distress are clear enough: dead children bad land brutal husbands. They need to be sent away for their own good but also because their presence is a rebuke to the fledgling settlement��s idea of itself." the Nebraska farmer played by Hilary Swank in ���The Homesman.�� A paragon of pioneer self-sufficiency she is capable and conscientious industrious and morally upright. Her prosperity looks like the visible reward of a sturdy work ethic and she takes pride in her tidy and well-appointed wooden house set amid the sod-sided hovels of her fellow homesteaders." a Norwegian woman with an especially nasty mate howls and bites. Arabella Sours (Grace Gummer) barely more than a child refuses to move or speak clutching the rag doll that is her substitute for the babies she lost.

The scene cuts away before he��s finished his speech but like his solitary wrestling it helps establish the narrowness of his world and the movie��s thematic terrain. By the time a school official is writing Mark his $20 check Mr. Miller has announced at least some of what he wants to tell us about America. Mark is so isolated visually and narratively that even when he eats ��� he scarfs fast food alone in his car and slurps instant noodles in his grim apartment ��� there��s no question that you��re watching the emergence of a character��s existential condition rather than some guy chow down." ���Foxcatcher�� is prefaced by the common assurance that it��s based on a true story although all the usual caveats apply with changes elisions and so forth. This is familiar ground for Mr. Miller whose films include two fictions rooted in history ���Capote�� and ���Moneyball �� which along with being just really good stories take diagnostic pokes at the national character and its swamp of confusing contradictory ideas about material success hard work self-invention and inevitably what it is to be a man." though it��s a slippery one. Beautifully acted and impeccably mounted it is light on historical details and heavy on atmosphere character and chintz. The first time you see Mark he��s alone in a gym wrestling with a grappling dummy an apparatus that looks like an anthropomorphized boxing bag complete with head and stubby arms. It��s a crude pas de deux somewhat like watching Gene Kelly get frisky with a beanbag and hypnotic because of its exotic choreography. It��s also off-putting because there��s something slightly comic and borderline pathetic about a man who is for all intents and purposes wrestling with himself. Soon after Mark delivers a speech to some school kids ��� he wants to tell them about America ��� for which he earns a princely $20." though I wish he had made more room for Mr. Ruffalo who enters and exits as Dave flashes in and out of Mark��s life. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the brothers including an early one in which they train in their old gym hitting and grasping in a pantomime of aggression and affection the crowns of their heads touching like the antlers of young stags testing each other. It��s rare to see such physical male intimacy on screen especially among men not bonded by war. And it��s in the depictions of this intimacy in its tangle of bodies and desires ��� the images of John squirming on top of and below other men say more than any of his pitiful speeches ��� that ���Foxcatcher�� rises to the occasion of real tragedy." with its rolling hills patrician veneer expensive kitsch tiptoeing servants stable of horses and a wizened wagging finger in the form of John��s disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Mr. Miller��s handling of the earlier stages in John and Mark��s relationship is impeccable and sometimes lightly uneasily comic. Mr. Carell��s physical transformation is perverse hypnotic and a touch distracting and you may find yourself searching for the familiar face behind the pasty skin and large prosthetic nose that juts from John��s face like a cruel joke. Little by little with long stares an old man��s shuffle and strange phrasing Mr. Carell transforms the character from a figure of ridicule into something truly grotesque." �� an eerie horror story about one American have and one have-not a startlingly transformed Steve Carell plays John Eleuth��re du Pont the chemical company heir. A dabbler extraordinaire and apparent fantasist whose family fortune was partly created on battlefields across the world ��� as a producer of gun powder dynamite and plutonium ��� the real du Pont collected monumental amounts of shells birds and stamps as well as guns and as the wealthy can do other human beings.

But there��s no one here like Capote to guide you through the murk and no one who gives the spectacle of human struggle its spark as the baseball savant Billy Beane does in ���Moneyball.�� Mark and John make a fine odd couple in ���Foxcatcher�� (things get seriously weird at the farm) but they never evolve into the kind of deep meaningful figures who can carry the weight of Mr. Miller��s symbolism and all those American flags." a vast swath of prime real estate in Newtown Square Pa. There John has created a wrestling facility that he��s baptized Foxcatcher Farm and which through his patronage he hopes or more rightly expects will lead to Olympic glory. Mark accepts the offer to live and train at Foxcatcher dazzled by John��s wealth and quasi-religious pitch ��� a hash of patriotism paternalism entrepreneurialism and old-fashioned hucksterism. Despite Mark��s appeals though his older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) himself a gifted wrestler who doesn��t want to uproot his family declines to join the crusade.

and from the Russian perspective the Lake Placid games are a minor unfortunate episode in a glorious and sometimes tragic history. The Soviet squad that lost in 1980 won gold medals in the next two Olympics and is almost universally regarded as the greatest hockey team ever assembled. In 1991 the system that spawned and sustained it ��� making national heroes and political pawns of its members ��� collapsed an event that altered the course of global sports along with everything else. Former Soviet players made their way to the N.H.L. where they did not always find a warm welcome." �� Gavin O��Connor��s 2004 feature about the 1980 American team with Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks is a fable of underdog grit and can-do spirit. ���Red Army�� touches on themes of friendship and perseverance and also offers a compact and vivid summary of recent Russian history. It provides as clear an explanation as I have seen for the appeal of Vladimir V. Putin who has revived some of the patriotic sentiments that held the old system in place including the emphasis on sports as an expression of national greatness. For Mr. Fetisov a former minister of sports a member of the National Assembly and a prosperous businessman this is a happy ending. It may also give Mr. Polsky or some future documentarian material for a sequel." and as high-ranking members of the Soviet military they enjoyed privileges denied to most of their fellow citizens.

He borrowed techniques and ideas about training and strategy from ballet and chess other great Soviet obsessions making his players perform somersaults and pirouettes in skates and heavy pads. In archival footage he appears jolly and cherubic in notable contrast to his successor Viktor Tikhonov a K.G.B. man who looks like a caricature of the gray-faced dogmatic Brezhnev-era apparatchik." crazy story ��� a Russian novel of Tolstoyan sweep and Gogol-esque absurdity ��� is recounted in ���Red Army �� Gabe Polsky��s jaunty collage of a documentary. Mr. Polsky is a tireless researcher and a dogged interviewer sometimes to the annoyance of his subjects. In an early sequence his pushiness earns a raised middle finger from the great defenseman Vyacheslav Fetisov but Mr. Fetisov��s occasionally grumpy participation is crucial to the film. As handsome as any movie star thoughtful and temperamental he is both narrator and hero and serves as a guide to the curious vanished world of high-level Communist athletics." and a genuine camaraderie that Mr. Fetisov and his colleagues look back on with nostalgia. When they make their way post-U.S.S.R. into the commercial world of the N.H.L. ���Red Army�� takes a poignant slightly surreal turn with cheesy American and Canadian television clips stepping in for old Russian newsreels and Western show business vulgarity sweeping aside the pomp and bluster of official Communism. The mid-��90s provided a happy second act for Mr. Fetisov and his erstwhile teammates who reunited as the Russian Five to win back-to-back Stanley Cups for the Detroit Red Wings." even those otherwise indifferent to hockey are likely to have vivid memories of the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid N.Y. when a bunch of American college players upset a formidable Soviet team. It was the Miracle on Ice a Cold War victory greeted with chants of ���U-S-A! U-S-A!�� and according to Herb Brooks the United States coach proof that our way of life was better than theirs."

But this is very much Noni��s story and Ms. Mbatha-Raw��s film and both Mr. Parker and his character seem to recognize that with gallantry and good humor. ���Beyond the Lights�� may be a fantasy ��� movies about love like songs about love tend to fall into that category ��� but it is an uncommonly smart and honest fantasy. What it wants us to believe most of all is that despite all the ugliness and exploitation in the world of entertainment the bond between artist and audience is a real and sustaining form of love in its own right. And the movie is marvelous proof of its own argument." and I meant both as compliments. Movie romances are not supposed to follow the strict conventions of realism and Ms. Prince-Bythewood��s script contrives enough twists coincidences and tearful confrontations to produce the necessary gasps giggles and sniffles. It sprinkles some glittery celebrity cameos among the scenes of earnest striving and ornaments Mark Isham��s emotive score with even more emotive songs culminating with a second a cappella rendition of ���Blackbird.�� At that moment as in quite a few others ���Beyond the Lights�� perfectly mirrors the swooning swirling unself-conscious access to feeling that pop music can provide." �� Gina Prince-Bythewood��s occasionally silly frequently stirring romantic melodrama was originally going to be called ���Blackbird �� after the Nina Simone song at its yearning heart. That song a blunt anguished barely metaphorical reckoning with the intimate psychic violence of racism and sexism is performed several times by Noni the film��s suffering pop star. The first time is as a young girl (played by India Jean-Jacques) at a South London talent show where we are introduced to the two forces that will rule her destiny: a stunning vocal gift and a ruthless stage mother." and Noni in the glare of her fame feels invisible as unloved and unrecognized as Nina Simone��s blackbird. One night she indulges a self-destructive impulse and is rescued by Kaz (Nate Parker) a Los Angeles police officer who has been assigned to her security detail. As she dangles from a hotel balcony he says three words that at least temporarily restore her will to live: ���I see you.��" of course is the product of an often cruel and impersonal machinery in whose gears aspiring artists like Noni often find themselves caught.

Honest hard-working and immune to glamour (though not to beauty) he embodies a fantasy of manhood and represents for Noni a possible refuge from the frenzy and superficiality of her working life. He also has some symmetrical issues of his own to deal with notably his father (Danny Glover) a police captain who sees in Kaz the fulfillment of his own thwarted ambition. Just as Noni has been groomed for stardom so has Kaz been prepared for political glory.

when his mother Moloojoon (Shohreh Aghdashloo) shakes him awake. Having returned to Iran he is back in his old bed surrounded by mementos and memories that will haunt him throughout his time in prison. As he��s being driven away the story flashes back to around the time when Maziar first arrives in Iran intending to cover the coming elections. Mr. Stewart packs a lot into these initial scenes filling in details about Maziar��s life ��� including the pregnancy of his girlfriend back in London and the dead father and dead sister who remain poignantly alive for him ��� and setting his personal liberation story within the larger political context of the liberating aspirations of the Green Movement." Mr. Bahari has described his ordeal as Kafkaesque. That��s a familiar modern shorthand for bizarre impenetrable nightmares and fitting here given that Mr. Bahari was accused of phantom crimes like being a Zionist. That��s getting ahead of the story however which begins in 2009 or maybe really in 1979 the year of the Iranian Revolution. Or perhaps it begins in 1953 when the United States and Britain backed a coup d���tat that led to the ouster of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh of Iran cementing the shah��s power and contributing to the anti-Americanism that ��� in all its absurd and deadly serious iterations ��� is spectacularly on display in ���Rosewater.��" ���Rosewater �� the directorial debut of Jon Stewart is an argument for filmmakers to start their trade after they��ve looked beyond the limits of their own horizons. This fictional movie tells the story of the real Maziar Bahari an Iranian-born journalist living in London who was arrested in Iran while covering the 2009 elections for Newsweek. Accused of being an agent for foreign intelligence organizations he was thrown into the Evin Prison where he was interrogated and beaten partly for the surreal reason that he had appeared on ���The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.�� Mr. Stewart��s interest in the material is obviously personal but his movie transcends mere self-interest." Maziar is engaged in political dialogue about Iran though now also with the dead and not just the living. As days turn into weeks and then months and the beatings and maddeningly circular sometimes surrealistically comic interrogations blur Maziar learns to escape through fantasies and memories. He conjures up his father (a very good Haluk Bilginer) a gracefully stern and ghostly presence who offers advice and gently harangues him. Maziar��s sister (Golshifteh Farahani) also appears offering comfort and guidance. There is insanity inside these walls but Maziar having opened himself to the world ��� to Chekhov Pasolini and Leonard Cohen ��� had already freed his mind long ago. The trick as you learn was getting the rest of him out too." which was written with Aimee Molloy and published as ���Then They Came for Me�� but has been promotionally repackaged as ���Rosewater.�� The book��s original title echoes the oft-quoted line from the German pastor Martin Niem�_ller ���Then they came for me ��� and there was no one left to speak for me.�� As a famous call to speaking out (originally against Nazism) it underscores the universal tug of Mr. Bahari��s ordeal even as it carries the complicating weight of the Holocaust. ���Rosewater�� is the better title partly because as Mr. Stewart makes clear it��s the specifics of Mr. Bahari��s story ��� his voice memories fantasies ghosts and abiding love of Leonard Cohen ��� that distinguishes it." and the world and its distractions fall away (and Mr. Bernal��s over-bright over-deployed smile dims) so do any qualms about the star. Whatever the reason Mr. Bernal was hired whether it was a question of getting the movie financed or simply a matter of directorial taste his intensely sympathetic screen presence suddenly makes sense. And it��s in Evin Prison that Mr. Stewart does his best work specifically in the scenes between Maziar and the man who gives the movie��s title its nauseating sickly meaning the guard (an excellent Kim Bodnia) whose rosewater perfume can��t obscure the stench that wafts off his body and announces his presence to his blindfolded prisoner. ���I could smell him �� Mr. Bahari writes ���before I saw him.��" the political and the personal ��� continues as Maziar reports on the election cruises the streets conducts interviews and takes the pulse of the people. Working with the cinematographer Bobby Bukowski Mr. Stewart gives the movie a run-and-gun tremble that��s familiar from documentaries and war movies. This visual approach along with the dusty churning streets (with Jordan standing in for Iran) swirling crowds and looming images of Iranian leaders contributes to the you-are-there authenticity that at first fights with some of Mr. Stewart��s other choices including casting a well-known Mexican actor as his lead and having the Iranian characters speak in accented English."

Vivid restored wartime footage shows Poles huddled in air raid bunkers slurping soup flirting with soldiers dodging sniper fire or going for a dip all with a breathtaking sense of tangible detail."

Roberto And�_'s ���Viva la Libert���� wobbles between being wispily suggestive of finer existential meaning and generational commentary and being basically a handsomely dressed-up ���Dave�� for post-Berlusconi Italy." just like that 50 percent of the film becomes deeply uninteresting. Away from the action Enrico seeks refuge with a married ex-girlfriend (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi) and gets involved with a film shoot but his time off feels diffuse and hastily sketched." Enrico��s jowly glumness next to Giovanni��s Groucho-eyebrowed insouciance. But Mr. And�_ flows ineffectually back and forth between the brothers making elegant use of some Verdi but less so of Mr. Servillo." the opposition leader Enrico Oliveri (Mr. Servillo) goes AWOL after an embarrassing speech at a party conference. In a pinch his chief operative (Valerio Mastandrea) installs Enrico��s brother Giovanni a philosophy professor and mental patient." a consummate holy fool a nagging vacuousness. But ���Viva la Libert���� amounts to a rather uninspiring satire at this point for a country frustrated by political decrepitude." with English subtitles"

for all the emphasis on hard work Ms. Meshel-Dillman doesn��t show it being done. She gives us the bustle and chaos of rehearsals but not the gaffes and try-agains that tighten and refine a sequence and take the students from the studio to the bright lights onstage." even sweet account but it��s too soft. Ms. Meshel-Dillman shows no real naysayers: parents who question the sacrifice or overwhelmed students. And though we hear about disappointment we see little of it. (One girl cries talking about a role she didn��t get.)" who appreciate the discipline and real-life lessons that school imparts ��� about disappointment and the prerogatives of talent. Not every girl after all gets to be a Sugar Plum Fairy." the movie takes us from auditions to opening night of an elaborate ���Nutcracker�� involving dancers ages 3 to 19. (And beyond. Some dads are conscripted for the party scenes.) Ms. Meshel-Dillman herself a former dancer who trained at the School of American Ballet has a clear and present fondness for the Daukayev school and its students and for Marat Daukayev the former Kirov dancer who runs it." ' �� Serene Meshel-Dillman��s documentary about a dance school preparing for a big performance. The unsurprising way you get to ���The Nutcracker��? Practice and hard work."

to be released as a two-part three-hour mini-series through video-on-demand platforms on Tuesday should be seen in its entirety. In its stunted theatrical version the second half is a sketchy digest of events that leaves you feeling cheated." the family patriarch is a surgeon; his wife Anne (Claudia Michelsen) is a nurse; and their son Christian (Sebastian Urzendowsky) is a sensitive bookworm with a rebellious streak. In a country plagued by shortages and power blackouts they live more comfortably than most of their neighbors. Behind closed doors they laughingly ridicule the Communist overseers who gather dirt on everyone including them and use it with fiendish ruthlessness." �� the major character is driven to the brink of insanity by paranoia and hopelessness. ���The Tower �� in its full three-hour version is the better film because of its sweeping overview of a society that operates on fear secrecy and duplicity ��� and doles out harsh prison sentences to anyone who is overheard criticizing the regime." Nelly finds herself in a limbo that is even more depressing than the world she left behind and she becomes increasingly paranoid. Ms. Triebel��s passionate performance is almost the equal of that of Nina Hoss as a persecuted doctor in Christian Petzold��s recent film ���Barbara.�� But ���West �� for all its intensity becomes too bogged down in detail to be as strong as it might have been." who grew up in Leipzig and East Berlin this epic-scale story spans the last seven years before the demise of East German Communism. It��s far from the first film to show how the Stasi the East German secret police infiltrated everyday life so thoroughly that no one could trust anyone and how society was gripped by institutionalized paranoia." he is pressured to atone by joining the army. The film��s most excruciating moments depict his East German Army training by bullying buffoons who force one poor overweight soldier to eat feces. With their barking cruelty these officers might as well be Nazis except for their bumbling incompetence." the father of her son Alexej died in a car accident she is grilled by British French and American agents who think he may still be alive and working for the Stasi. They follow her wherever she goes." he is pressured to be their puppet. His career and family endangered he disintegrates." and any intrusion can be justified in the interests of security." being shown at Cinema Village in New York coincides with the opening of ���West �� Mr. Schwochow��s similarly themed adaptation of a novel by Julia Franck at Anthology Film Archives. Set several years earlier in the late 1970s ���West�� tells the story of Nelly (J�_rdis Triebel) a beautiful organic chemist who leaves East Berlin with her young son only to find herself trapped for months in a dreary West Berlin refugee center."

with English subtitles" somewhat clumsy yet full of illuminating interviews seems mostly like an exercise in building national pride but it holds lessons for anyone trying to resist an overwhelming force. NEIL GENZLINGER" �� a documentary about the doomed resistance movement that tried to block the Soviet takeover of Lithuania in the aftermath of World War II might seem just an interesting bit of fading history were it not for two very timely echoes. One of course is that although the Soviet Union is no more Russia seems to have taken over the role of exerting muscle in neighboring countries. The other is that the resistance fighters in Lithuania like some contemporary people in strife-torn places put too much hope in the idea that the United States would ride to their rescue." a resistance leader who escaped from Lithuania in 1948 to among other things try to generate support for the partisans abroad and then returned to the country voluntarily with the help of the C.I.A. His story didn��t end well ��� among those heard from in the film is the fellow partisan who ultimately betrayed him ��� and the resistance was crushed."

���The Better Angels �� is also a Christ story in a strange key. It opens with black-and-white images of the Lincoln Memorial some suggestive of the view of an awe-struck visitor. The absence of color holds your eye (black-and-white has become a palette for gimmicks and obscure auteurs) as do several arcs traced by the camera as if that visitor were looking up and even searching. The camera movements seem familiar not only because they mirror the physical effort of what it��s like to tilt your head and stretch your neck to gape up at a cathedral window or gathering clouds but also because they evoke Terrence Malick." and the movie is threaded with snatches of ordinary talk and a hushed intermittent voice-over taken from the reminiscences of Lincoln��s cousin Dennis Hanks that fills in a few blanks. There are scenes of hard work of Lincoln��s father Tom (Jason Clarke) chopping wood and plowing a field but there are many more scenes of Abe and others including his mother Nancy (Brit Marling) staring into the distance and sometimes drifting through the grass as the camera hovers like an attentive supplicant. The sense of predestination hangs heavily over the movie but not a sense of life. The historian Garry Wills once described Lincoln as ���a Transcendentalist without the fuzziness��; this Abe is all fuzz." although it was a project that he was once interested in directing; rather he has helped shepherd it into existence giving his blessing by serving as a producer. ���The Better Angels�� was written and directed by A. J. Edwards who has worked on several of Mr. Malick��s recent titles including ���The New World �� and has now for reasons that are at once understandable and baffling made his own Malickian movie. Not Malick Malickian because ��� in its wandering and rushing cameras; its grandly sheltering sky and trees; its lovely people walking and gazing and sometimes twirling in the tall grass; and its evocations of a Christian paradise lost and surely refound ��� ���The Better Angels�� proudly announces itself as an aesthetic pastiche." ��� ���all that I am or hope to be I owe to my angel mother �� raising expectations of the childhood scenes that soon follow. The young Abe (the pretty Braydon Denney) is introduced in Indiana in 1817 sitting with a book and a faraway gaze not far from the tiny cabin in which he and his family live. Abe does a lot of staring and some reading at one point opening ���The Pilgrim��s Progress �� which Mr. Edwards shows in close-up as if to ensure we read its subtitle too: ���From This World to That Which Is to Come.�� Mr. Edwards doesn��t connect this to the boy Lincoln was or the man he became: His filmmaking method is by turns elliptical and overbearing."

however Nick and his monitor rapidly become the patsies of this unseen psycho and his elaborate plans as well as the focus of some masked French hackers who may want to help or may just want to practice their English. I really have no idea." the plot is simplicity itself as Nick (Elijah Wood) an entertainment blogger is contacted online by a creepy British stranger who offers him the chance to spy on his favorite starlet (Sasha Grey) through her computer and phone cameras." like Nick��s ability to speed-drive his car while staring at his laptop. Was it wrong to wish that both of them would crash?" ���Open Windows�� clearly wants to say something about ubiquitous surveillance and invasion of privacy. But the exposed flesh of its imperiled celebrity and the army of eager peepers it attracts offer only weak reminders of a real-world tabloid narrative." Nacho Vigalondo��s ���Open Windows�� unfolds entirely on a computer screen whose manipulators are sometimes visible and more often not. The result is a thriller with so many viewpoints feints and fake-outs that it swiftly disappears up its own URL."
