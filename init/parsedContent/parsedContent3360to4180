her life has morphed into unlikely legend and a surprisingly durable brand. Bettie mania has gone high with a Florida museum exhibition of images snapped by Bunny Yeager and it�۪s also gone predictably low with an endless parade of Bettie-related paraphernalia from T-shirts to handbags lunchboxes poker chips beauty products light-switch plates and a line of shoes that the licensee describes as ���catering to the Rockabilly Pin-Up and Burlesque genres.�۝" but the industry that has steadily grown up around her since the 1980s lives on most recently in the promisingly titled documentary ���Bettie Page Reveals All.�۝ Page admirers may wonder what�۪s left to tell. The Queen of Curves as she was known publicly shared some of her highs and lows ��� her hard Tennessee childhood and her cheesecake years in New York in the 1950s ��� including in the authorized 1996 biography ���Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend.�۝ This was followed by Richard Foster�۪s 1997 unauthorized biography ���The Real Bettie Page: The Truth About the Queen of the Pinups �۝ which filled in some of the uglier depressing chapters in her life that she tended to discreetly elide." written by Douglas Miller and ��� best of all ��� narrated by Page in her low gruff Southern drawl ���Bettie Page Reveals All�۝ covers much of the material that�۪s been related elsewhere but with some nice differences. For starters Mr. Mori actually seems to have liked Page for whom he displays genuine believable affection and he shares the bad along with the good without giggles judgment or rank sensationalism. Her voice-over stitched together from less than optimal audio interviews suggests that Page liked him in turn. This helps warm up the story particularly when she discusses her often-brutal childhood which was marked by sexual abuse and a stay in an orphanage and some of the equally desperate interludes that marred her adulthood." both in the tale and its telling. No life is seamless and not every biographical portrait needs to be but this one is so riddled with awkward transitions including on the soundtrack that it tends to lurch distractingly as if Mr. Mori were still trying to figure out how to piece the whole thing together. He also spends too much time on the obvious ��� Page was sexy beautiful a natural the camera loved her she loved it va va va voom and blah blah blah ��� and less time on the less-familiar interludes including her high school years (she graduated second in her class) and time at Peabody College where she majored in English acted in plays and worked on a school magazine before receiving her B.A. in 1944." instead of the pretty and popular figure on display here with and without her bikini. But legends can be easier to sell than people which may explain why so many of this movie�۪s talking heads testify to Page�۪s legacy as if the case still needed to be made. Some of the witnesses for the defense like Greg Theakston who was instrumental to the 1980s Page revival with his zine ���The Betty Pages �۝ have something to say. Others including a few of the glamour-pusses who pop up in some shoddy looking material shot at a gallery event tend to talk about Page as an abstraction a brand a cartoon with bangs and breasts ��� all of which Page became of course even as the real woman turned into one indelibly tough old broad." she doesn�۪t."

the Roman sensualist magnificently poetically adrift in ���The Great Beauty �۝ he has a cigarette clenched in the center of his big bared ocher-stained teeth. People are surging all around him their bodies pulsating to music that has transformed a multitude into an organism that beats like a heart. As he sways amid this delirium Jep smiles with welcoming arms and lidded eyes an attitude that brings to mind one of those marble saints scattered around Rome forever locked in rapture. And then Jep joins the dance surrendering to a throng that in absorbing him turns an orgiastic reverie into something like a religious communion." ���The Great Beauty�۝ is the story of a man a city a country and a cinema though not necessarily in that order. It was directed by Paolo Sorrentino whose last big-screen adventure was ���This Must Be the Place �۝ an English-language story about a goth musician (Sean Penn Kabukied up to look like Robert Smith from the Cure) who after the death of his father a Holocaust survivor comes out of self-imposed exile to become a Nazi hunter. After a nearly stillborn start it soars during an explicitly European road trip across America that exults in the rough beauty of the country�۪s Western landscapes and in that American gift (and curse) for shaking off the past." �۝ Mr. Sorrentino has not only returned to Italy he has also taken on its past and how it weighs on the present and future. Set in Rome that immortal city of ancients and tourists the movie follows Jep a sybarite played with a veneer of wit and fathomless soul by the Italian actor Toni Servillo who dances into the story while celebrating his 65th birthday. Four decades earlier Jep�۪s only novel ���The Human Apparatus �۝ was hailed as a masterpiece but that was many years and glasses of Campari ago. These days he works (if barely) as a journalist and lives in a terraced apartment overlooking the Colosseum. He was he says during his party ���destined for sensibility.�۝" too was Mr. Sorrentino who in ���The Great Beauty�۝ has created a wildly inventive and sometimes thrilling ode to sensibility and to some of its linguistic cousins like sensation sensitivity and sentiment. Structured as a series of loosely connected episodes the peripatetic story comes into focus soon after Jep�۪s birthday when he learns that his first love an enigmatic blonde who smiles at him in his memories of a seaside idyll has died. Her husband breaks the bad news to Jep and together they weep an emotional torrent which ��� in an elegiac illustration of Mr. Sorrentino�۪s associative method ��� initially evokes Jep�۪s memories of the dead woman whom he watches while swimming and then comes to a watery culmination with the men embracing in a hard rain." dines with friends and meditates on his life in voice-overs that sound like confessions. Elegantly attired his gray hair swept back and curling at his neck a handkerchief fountaining out of his jacket pocket Jep is the very picture of the fl̢neur the 19th-century urban stroller and spectator immortalized by Charles Baudelaire and in whom Walter Benjamin wrote ���the joy of watching is triumphant.�۝ What the fl̢neur watches is modern life and other people. ���The crowd is the veil �۝ Benjamin wrote ���through which the familiar city beckons to the fl̢neur as phantasmagoria ��� now a landscape now a room.�۝" born in Paris did not spring from the glorious archaeological sprawl that is Rome. ���But perhaps in Rome even dreaming is forced to move along streets that are too well-paved.�۝ He suggested that for a fl̢neur Rome�۪s ���great reminiscences the historical frissons�۝ are so much junk better left to the tourists. The tourist that familiar figure of contempt plays a crucial role in ���The Great Beauty �۝ which opens with a prologue set in the Janiculum a hill west of the Tiber. There scattered amid busts of heroes of the Risorgimento the 19th-century movement for Italian unification a smattering of Italians mill about while a group of Japanese tourists take in the sights ��� a view a city a people a history ��� that Mr. Sorrentino suggests the natives no longer necessarily see." ���The Great Beauty�۝ is about Jep�۪s wakening to a world that as he strolls around Rome ��� his ears tuned in to children�۪s laughter his eyes fixed on a courtyard scene ��� has become charming atmospheric noise. As he walks along the Tiber early one morning he explains in voice-over that when he arrived in Rome at 26 he decided that he wanted to become ���the king of the high life.�۝ But he didn�۪t just want to go to parties he continues he wanted to have ���the power to make them a failure.�۝ It�۪s a little comment seemingly trivial and yet also revealing because as Jep began��partying in Rome in the 1970s the country experienced what became known as the Years of Lead a time of political violence and the Red Brigades. (Meanwhile the world mourned the deaths of��those neorealist fathers��Vittorio De Sica ��Luchino Visconti��and Roberto Rossellini.)" �۝ from the statue of Garibaldi inscribed with the words ���Roma o Morte�۝ (���Rome or Death�۝) to the funeral where Jep tearfully hoists a coffin. Mostly though there is beauty reborn as Mr. Sorrentino�۪s cameras fly through Rome knocking the dust off the city�۪s monuments and Jep alike. At one point during one of his nightly salons Jep casually tells his friends that ���the best people in Rome are the tourists.�۝ It sounds like a glib aside. Yet as he emerges from the long wandering that has defined him ��� a drift that Mr. Sorrentino suggests that has been shared by one and all ��� Jep opens up to awe affirming what all visitors know: we are only passing through so we had better make the most of our visit."

���Nebraska �۝ shares its name with Bruce Springsteen�۪s austere album from 1982. Nebraska is a roomy state and Mr. Payne born and raised in Omaha has set three of his previous features at least partly in it (���Citizen Ruth �۝ ���Election�۝ and ���About Schmidt�۝). But to my ear at least a specific Springsteenian echo announces itself early and deepens as this movie winds from Billings Mont. across the Badlands and toward Lincoln stopping for a while in the tiny and fictitious hamlet of Hawthorne. Beyond the folky intonations of the fiddle-and-guitar waltz (by Mark Orton) that accompanies the opening images (shot by Phedon Papamichael) and beyond the bleak beauty of the images themselves there is something in the movie that brings to mind the haunting last line of the album�۪s title track: ���Sir I guess there�۪s just a meanness in this world.�۝" that cruelty is offered from death row as a shrugging excuse for murder. The only consequential violence in Mr. Payne�۪s ���Nebraska �۝ based on a script by Rob Nelson is a punch in the face that has been well earned by the recipient. (Lately Mr. Payne seems to allow himself one or two such righteous blows per movie: Think of George Clooney clocking Matthew Lillard in ���The Descendants�۝ and Sandra Oh busting Thomas Haden Church�۪s nose with a motorcycle helmet in ���Sideways.�۝) This is a comedy with plenty of acutely funny lines a handful of sharp sight gags and a few minutes of pure perfect madcap. But a grim unmistakable shadow falls across its wintry landscape. The world it depicts a small-town America that is fading aging and on the verge of giving up is blighted by envy suspicion and a general failure of good will. Hard times are part of the picture and so are hard people." but the emotions that drive ���Nebraska�۝ are much more complicated than condescension. There is palpable nostalgia here and real affection for the plain speech and democratic manners of the rural Midwest. There is also a strong current of anger directed through the characters and at them though it almost never rises to the surface. If it did the Great Plains which once sat at the bottom of a prehistoric ocean might be flooded with tears of melodramatic rage. So much betrayal so much disappointment so much wasted potential and thwarted love." an elderly Hawthorne native long exiled to Billings feels any resentment or homesickness he isn�۪t about to say so. A taciturn grouch with a lifelong commitment to drinking and an often-stated desire to be left alone Woody is first seen walking along a snow-fringed Montana highway stooped and scowling in the wind. He wants to go to Lincoln not to get in touch with his Cornhusker roots but because a company based there has sent him one of those sucker-bait sweepstakes letters implying that he may have won a million dollars." �۝ says Woody�۪s younger son David (Will Forte) and neither he; his brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk); nor their mother Kate (June Squibb) knows quite what to make of Woody�۪s conviction that a fortune awaits him a few states away. And the audience might wonder too. Is he really that deluded? Suffering from dementia? Just not very bright? Kate as forthright as her husband is vague might endorse the latter view: The first words we hear her say to Woody are: ���You dumb cluck!�۝ (The last uttered with more tenderness are ���You big idiot.�۝)" a replacement anchor on local television with an unseen family and a tidy comb-over think it�۪s time to put Woody in a nursing home. David whose life seems a bit stalled decides to indulge his dad. He calls in sick to his job selling stereo equipment and sets off in his Subaru the deputy fool on a fool�۪s errand a weary Sancho to the old man�۪s Quixote." where ���Nebraska�۝ blossoms into a study of provincial American absurdity worthy of Preston Sturges. David is the exasperated conscience of the story a guy clinging to his own decency ��� and trying to defend his father�۪s dignity ��� in the face of threats from within and without. Mr. Forte a former ���Saturday Night Live�۝ cast member is exactly nice enough to earn our sympathy without entirely winning our admiration. David either complains too much or not quite enough." and Mr. Dern turns this inarticulate alcoholic lump of humanity ��� too passive to be a monster too distracted to be charming ��� into a great screen character. He is far from heroic or even noble but Woody�۪s stubbornness and the waves of unacknowledged feeling that emanate from his grizzled shapeless face and unsteady bulky frame make him worth caring about. Not that it�۪s easy for anyone." many of them played by Nebraskans who aren�۪t normally professional actors. He also runs into Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) his former partner in an auto-repair shop and the kind of pal who makes enemies redundant. When word gets out that the returned Montana prodigal is a newly minted millionaire the smiles in Hawthorne grow wider and more predatory. A few people seem genuinely happy for Woody ��� he gets a round of applause at the steakhouse thanks to good old two-faced Ed ��� but it is hard to tell given the studied blandness that governs every interaction." things become a little clearer and also more confrontational. Ms. Squibb killed off early in ���About Schmidt �۝ brings a jolt of tart comic energy ��� a dash of vinegar in the mashed potatoes. Kate�۪s blunt honesty is in many ways the key to ���Nebraska �۝ balancing both Woody�۪s sad illusions and the smiling duplicity of almost everybody else." and lucky to have left Hawthorne and raised two devoted reasonably well-adjusted sons. But part of the honesty of ���Nebraska�۝ is its skepticism about the very idea of luck and about the dream of happiness we are all as Americans encouraged to pursue. Woody�۪s sweepstakes letter is an empty promise something he alone refuses to acknowledge even if you sometimes suspect he knows better. But it is not as if any of the other promises Woody might have counted on have given him much. He approaches the end of his life in a state far deeper than regret. His default answers to any question about his life are ���Don�۪t know�۝ and ���Doesn�۪t matter.�۝" family and community have fallen away but that they were never really there to begin with. Yet somehow the feeling that lingers after the last shot is the opposite of despair. If you listen to ���Nebraska�۝ all the way through you will come away with this thought: At the end of every hard-earned day people find some reason to believe." 
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/movies/lion-ark-focuses-on-an-animal-rescue-mission.html
�۝ a spunky account of a perilous rescue mission has a ragtag rhythm that befits the mercurial behavior of its hulking hairy stars. Following a group from Animal Defenders International as it conducts the 2010 roundup and relocation of 25 captive lions illegally held in traveling circuses in Bolivia this warmhearted documentary from Tim Phillips makes ���Born Free�۝ look like a beast story for babes." malnourished and suffering from bone disease and mental distress ��� are not the only dangers faced by Mr. Phillips and his wife Jan Creamer (co-founders of Animal Defenders) and their small team. Furious circus owners defying a 2009 law that would destroy their livelihood stand ready to slash tires and worse. Daunting logistics like hauling rickety cages filled with hundreds of pounds of snarling animals over crumbling roads at night add to the film�۪s drama and the team�۪s headaches. Five thousand miles away in Colorado a sanctuary is being constructed for the lions; all Mr. Phillips has to do is get them there." ���Lion Ark�۝ is also largely free of the gooey sentiment common to nature films. In its place is grainy undercover footage of circus animals being violently beaten and even bitten by remorseless trainers. Wisely refusing to linger on the shocking Mr. Phillips seasons his film with the unexpected ��� like a surreal encounter with a stranger dressed as Zorro and wild bursts of punk music that swell up out of nowhere." ���Lion Ark�۝ proceeds with refreshing unpredictability and an unpolished vigor. Joy Adamson would surely approve."

a note identifies ���Faust �۝ Alexander Sokurov�۪s brooding hallucinatory freehanded adaptation of Goethe�۪s great allegorical drama as the concluding installment of a four-film sequence the ���Men of Power�۝ tetralogy that also includes ���Moloch�۝ (1999) ���Taurus�۝ (2001) and ���The Sun�۝ (2005). Those movies are intimate and unsettling visits with some of the chief monsters of the 20th century: Hitler Lenin and Hirohito. What links them is a lust for power at once madly destructive and profoundly lonely. While Mr. Sokurov does not exactly express sympathy for these devils he refuses to view them as anything other than human." ���Faust �۝ which forsakes history for fable can be understood as an attempt to trace the pathology of modern totalitarianism to its historical and psychological source in the quest for scientific knowledge and everlasting life. Goethe�۪s hero ��� a figure of late-medieval German legend who also fascinated Christopher Marlowe Richard Wagner Charles Gounod and Thomas Mann ��� is motivated by curiosity ambition and love. The tragedy is that these impulses cost him his soul but there is an undeniable element of heroism of nobility in his desire to transcend human limitations. Among his descendants are dictators who are worshiped until they are reviled and whose grand visions end in nihilism waste and murder. His tale is cautionary and also seductive." however that Mr. Sokurov�۪s ���Faust�۝ is a dry exercise in philosophical reflection. While he is certainly driven by ideas ��� his ���Russian Ark�۝ is an advanced course in Russian social and intellectual history in the form of a single 90-minute-long Steadicam shot ��� this director�۪s methods are sensual earthy and at times almost dementedly passionate. One of the first images in ���Faust �۝ following a dreamy descent from cloud-dappled digital skies into a German mountain village is an extreme close-up of a dead man�۪s penis. A grisly autopsy follows during which Faust (the Ralph Fiennes-like Johannes Zeiler) a man of medicine like his father (who is seen stretching a patient on a rack) wonders aloud about the anatomical location of the human spirit." sometimes delivered to his assistant Wagner (Georg Friedrich) are juxtaposed with the sights sounds and smells of the world around him which can look like a Bruegel painting come to life. The camera swerving and pivoting around Faust as he paces his dusty rooms and barrels through narrow streets catches sight of rabbits oxen dogs goats and other animals. The air echoes with muttered prayers the clatter of wagon wheels flatulence and moaning. And also the music of Richard Strauss (among others) which along with the graceful camera movements suggests that humanity is perpetually caught between filth and sublimity." who is the film�۪s Mephistopheles figure a cheerful demon whose presence in the town seems to be taken for granted. Warned against defecating next to a church he gleefully announces that he will do it inside. He attracts a bit of teasing from the women at the local bath house who are amused rather than horrified at his bizarre physique: folds of waxy flesh up front and shrunken genitals in back where a tail might be." the mismatched halves of a metaphysical buddy picture. Faust�۪s anguish arises not only from his scientific vocation but also from his love for the blond and dewy Margarete (Isolde Dychauk) whose beauty is a further incentive to seek immortality. But his central relationship is with the fellow who holds title to his soul and their contractual bond takes on an increasingly strange intensity." which is best understood not through its plot or its themes but through the dreamy operatic elusive spell it casts on the viewer. Mr. Sokurov likes a muted cloudy palette (the cinematographer is Bruno Delbonnel who shot ���Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince�۝) and a boxy squared-off screen." especially at the beginning a claustrophobic feeling. This is a circumscribed world of thwarted souls and dim prospects. Gradually though in the Devil�۪s company we (and Faust) begin to discover the mysterious beauty of the human environment and the grandeur of nature. The movie expands in its frame surpassing simple comprehension and continuing to grow in your mind ��� and perhaps to blow it ��� long after it�۪s over."

Watching it feels like packing a semester-long history course with a very cool left-leaning teacher into less than 90 minutes. The aim is wide-reaching and abstract yet cohesive and invigorating." in which an objective voice of God gives a third-person description of the life of an exotic subject this narration uses the second person to address the audience directly. The narrator outlines specific tasks through which audience members can supposedly achieve enlightenment like ���counterattacking your inner programming�۝ and not watching television because ���it is used to dumb us down systematically.�۝ We are advised to practice taking good care of ourselves in a ���system designed to make you sick through ���nutricide.�۪�ʉ۝" referring to Puerto Rico as a slave of the United States is a reminder of the connection between slavery and colonization the major focus of the film.

but it�۪s a stretch to call this videotaped acting exercise a movie. Written and directed by a New York University graduate Ryan Lonergan and mostly starring other N.Y.U. graduates it�۪s essentially a modern version of ���The Big Chill�۝ without the banging oldies soundtrack or competent actors." who gather for a weekend reunion in 2010. Both these privileged college chums and their social-climbing significant others speak in a mixed bag of shockingly bad accents. There is little sense of thought or discovery in the actors�۪ delivery. The exceptions are Garrett McKechnie a Carnegie Mellon graduate who brings an intelligent playfulness to his role as an Iraq war veteran named Thomas and Ellen Etten who seems to have fun as Mabel a character who performs sexual acts on her husband for pocket change." Mr. Lonergan says that he wanted to make a story about his millennial generation. But why do the successful lawyers and investment brokers here seem to be struggling with issues so similar to the yuppies of ���The Big Chill�۝? The out-of-date oddness of this enterprise might be explained by the fact that filming began in 2008 capturing a glimpse of a future imagined before the full depth of the financial collapse was realized. That might also explain why some of the outdoor shots look more amateurish than images captured with today�۪s smartphones."

And it�۪s not immediately apparent why anyone still puts up with the troublemaking television diva Shelby (Melissa De Sousa)." specifically the comfortable home of Lance the everlastingly gracious Mia (Monica Calhoun) and their polite offspring. But if the soapy dramas that emerge out of the movie�۪s status-anxiety comedy feel predictable and unhappily tilted against the women having stars with some charisma helps especially Terrence Howard as the unrepentant horndog Quentin.

And as the saying goes ���You can�۪t live on love alone.�۝ Because they both smoke cigarettes and Richie is a heavy drinker much of their meager income goes to feed bad habits.

The modern university is a complex organism that to function efficiently needs every component including someone to cut the grass." and although Mr. Wiseman as is his wont is neither seen nor heard in a film that proceeds without commentary or subtitles his spirit is palpable. Without overtly editorializing the film quietly and steadfastly champions state-funded public education available to all. In the language of one commentator the film�۪s subject is ���how capitalism is reshaping education�۝ in an age of dwindling resources and the fading of the middle-class dream. Diversity to which Berkeley appears deeply committed is central to the enterprise." which plunged drastically in only a few years. A question that runs through the film is how and where you cut back without harming the quality not to mention the availability of education in one of the country�۪s most respected institutions.

Eloquent as some of the demonstrators may be many of their demands sound petty and even contradictory. The administration has no choice but to take them seriously and to gird for the possibility of unrest which doesn�۪t materialize.

And just as we know that Jiro and Nahoko�۪s bliss has an end so too are we aware that the bubble in which he toils will not last forever.

Milan (Olivier Marchal) and Victor (Jacques Gamblin) have bad history with each other and worse history with the Terminator-like villain Serki (Carlo Brandt) whom they betrayed in an ochre-tinted Mexico. Six years later Serki is out of jail and wants revenge in a purple-tinted nighttime Paris." a credibly prickly rapport and a few genuine moments as 50ish men no longer able to outrun their pasts. Mr. Marie making his debut as a director swathes their tale in a thick coat of style that teeters between cool and mannered. His after-hours Paris is full of disreputable pleasures: It�۪s all pulsating clubs ��� in one dance-floor chic includes a bejeweled eye patch ��� and sad hotel rooms hooker included." Milan says somewhat more colorfully as he and Victor speed along the Seine in a motorboat fleeing Serki�۪s thugs. And so does Mr. Marie who seems intent on giving it some scruffy gangster cred. His movie shares that ��� and a sadistic streak and a bit of old-fashioned existential dread ��� with the television series ���Braquo �۝ which makes sense. Mr. Marchal created the series (you can watch it on Hulu) and Mr. Marie has written for it." �۝ Mr. Marie�۪s movie echoes its themes while being less solemn and hence less silly.

Apparently based on the experiences of Ms. Popovic and others associated with the film ���L.A. Superheroes�۝ is at times endearing humorous and insightful. But her golden nugget of a story idea suffers in the big-screen telling. The acting is uneven (Ms. Popovic is sincere but wooden); tirades by the increasingly grating Mr. Zisiades are too long; and the filmmaking is often amateurish." though. And there is some tension after Helena detained by the F.B.I. decides to name names and then worries that she will be whacked. While it would have been helpful to flesh out Helena�۪s back story viewers get only hints of her past life as a thriving model (how did she travel?) with wealthy friends (possibly Russell Simmons?) and an ex-husband (an American?) who may have hurt her documentation chances."

The film�۪s handling of Jaggers (Robbie Coltrane) Pip�۪s dispassionate lawyer and a puller of many plot strings is perfunctory despite Mr. Coltrane�۪s expansive performance." the creators declare erotic heat to be at the movie�۪s heart but there is none. There is also little evidence to support the filmmakers�۪ declaration that their handling of the novel�۪s detective story elements reflects the influence of film noir." since this ���Great Expectations�۝ is essentially a reverent traditional accounting of the Dickens classic.

But the flimsy detective story draped over them is underdeveloped and too sluggishly paced to take hold. This self-financed movie reportedly made for less than a million dollars badly needs a dash of Hollywood-style action. It turns out that Rodney and his partner had run afoul of Chinese gangsters (barely glimpsed in the film) who are holding him for ransom. But the violence takes place off screen leaving the movie with too little suspense.

The ink adorns Elise (Veerle Baetens) a tattoo artist who lives with her bearded partner Didier (Johan Heldenbergh) a bluegrass musician and their young daughter Maybelle (Nell Cattrysse) in the kind of picturesque country spread where a dog chases chickens that roost in a pickup truck. It looks like a slice of hillbilly heaven except that this isn�۪t Kentucky but a pastoral corner near the Flemish city of Ghent in Belgium." which opens with a shell-shocked Elise and Didier at a hospital where they learn that Maybelle has cancer. The movie then begins skipping around in time beginning with a flashback to when Didier first took Elise home to his country compound. He explores her tattoos and she learns why he loves the banjo (it snarls) and then it�۪s back to the hospital. And so it goes with flashbacks that trace Elise and Didier�۪s relationship and evolving musical partnership (they have sex harmonize become pregnant have Maybelle) scenes that invariably cycle back to the sad present." if only because it establishes how happy Elise and Didier were once upon a time before their daughter�۪s illness. The couple fall in love quickly deeply and it isn�۪t long before she�۪s moved in with him a chapter that Mr. Groeningen makes convincingly real with short sexy scenes of them teasingly playfully discovering each other in bed and out while wrapped in a shimmering golden light. Music plays a large role in their romance especially once Elise ��� who has a high pure sweet voice ��� begins singing with Didier and his band which covers American standards like ���Will the Circle Be Unbroken �۝ which inspired the movie�۪s title." the temporal shuffling feels more programmatic than revelatory and increasingly false. Elise and Didier are appealing characters at once vaguely exotic and reassuringly familiar and it�۪s pleasurable (as it often the case with romantic stories) to watch them fall in love." by insistently shuffling between the past and the present Mr. Groeningen who wrote the script with Carl Joos creates a suspect indefensible logic that suggests that it�۪s because Elise and Didier were once so intensely happy that their grief is so extraordinary. Life doesn�۪t work that way even if movies sometimes do which is how this one�۪s high lonesome sound gets lost in a banal country song."

even in a waxworks like ���Diana.�۝ A slice of biographical conjecture about the Princess of Wales this movie isn�۪t especially good but it wins you over a little just because it succeeds where truckloads of sanctifying reminiscences have failed: Anchored by Ms. Watts�۪s sympathetic performance it humanizes the woman behind the smile the helmet hair and the myth. Part reheated gossip part moony romance it revisits an affair Diana had with a Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan a liaison she managed to keep from the ravenous media maw that she routinely fed and spectacularly failed to control." she�۪s padding through the gilt rooms of a luxurious hotel suite the low-moving camera nipping at her heels. For some reason the director Oliver Hirschbiegel is obscuring Diana�۪s face an attempt that quickly feels strained. He may be trying to emphasize the normalcy of the scene by keeping her under wraps. Yet as Diana walks into a hall pointedly turns toward the camera and then enters an elevator where surveillance imagery carries a foreboding time stamp Aug. 31 1997 it seems increasingly evident that he�۪s trying to pump drama into a story that will soon end in off-screen tragedy. Such is the unevenness of his method: He nicely conveys an intimate restlessness only to blow the mood with ominous tidings." �۝ which like many movie biographies about doomed figures struggles to find a balance between the historical (life as it was lived) and the histrionic (life as it has been consecrated). After its opening walkabout the story shifts to two years earlier when Diana and Prince Charles are already separated. Now ensconced in Kensington Palace in London with a fairly modest retinue she is struggling very much alone to find her place. (Her sons were often at boarding school.) She meets Hasnat (an appealing low-key Naveen Andrews paunched-up and deglammed) when she visits a friend in the hospital. All surgical work and next to no play Hasnat scarcely gives her a second look erotic catnip to a woman used to being the center of world attention." including in the touchingly restrained testimony he presented in 2004 during the inquest into her death. The movie is based on Kate Snell�۪s 2000 account of the relationship in ���Diana: Her Last Love �۝ which like many such accounts prematurely wreathes the affair in black bunting. Stephen Jeffrey�۪s script covers the arc of the relationship ��� its tentative beginning and predictable complications ��� which unfolded in private even as Diana lived out loud. Better yet the filmmakers make room for the little ordinary things that princesses do after they kick off their heels at the palace ��� like watching television or using a microwave ��� normalizing a woman who�۪s more often mummified than enshrined." despite its longueurs overexcited passages and insistent fatalism. Mr. Hirschbiegel recreates some of Diana�۪s headline moments like her controversial visit to Angola to draw attention to land mines but he does better when he follows her after the limo drives off and the smile fades. In scene after scene he and Ms. Watts ��� whose face delicately expresses competing emotions as despair turns to hope and sincerity battles guile ��� make Diana�۪s crushing loneliness palpable lived-in and real. That loneliness fades after the affair starts and Diana discovers and savors everyday pleasures whether she�۪s driving Hasnat around or accompanying him to a jazz club unrecognized under her dark wig. It�۪s like watching a newborn take its first breath."

Matthew McConaughey brings a jolt of unpredictable energy to ���Dallas Buyers Club �۝ an affecting if conventional real-life story of medical activism. The film directed by Jean-Marc Vall̩e from a script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack tells the story of Ron Woodroof a Texas electrician and rodeo rider who after receiving a diagnosis of H.I.V. in 1985 took his treatment into his own hands and helped others with the disease obtain medication not legally available in the United States at the time." he is enjoying the company of two women and preparing to mount an enraged bull. Flamboyantly heterosexual and crudely homophobic he runs on cigarettes liquor and arrogance with an occasional dose of speed or coke to boost his confidence. He is a proud good old boy but not an especially nice person. In time of course his rougher edges will be smoothed away by suffering and compassion though he will never entirely lose his wild profane lust for life. He is redeemed but not fully sanctified." Ron tangles with a medical establishment partly blinded by its self-interest. Never an easy patient ��� he has a habit of unhooking IV drips and bolting from hospital beds ��� he becomes a thorn in the side of doctors at the hospital where his condition is first diagnosed. He flouts the rules of an experimental drug trial buys stolen AZT from an orderly and does a lot of angry shouting at Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) and her boss (Denis O�۪Hare)." Dr. Saks will become an ally as she and Ron ��� he instinctively she by more careful scientific means ��� conclude that high doses of AZT are likely to do more harm than good in fighting H.I.V. Ron meanwhile has found his way to Mexico where a renegade American doctor (Griffin Dunne) persuades him that a combination of drugs and dietary supplements can help the immune system and stabilize the T-cells. Soon he is smuggling pills across the border at one point disguised as a cancer-stricken priest. Back home he circumvents the rules against selling unapproved medicines by starting the subscription service that gives the movie its name. Patrons pay a monthly fee and receive regular orders of Ron�۪s contraband." and other details in the film remind viewers of the often poisonous social climate of the times. Ron�۪s friends shun him showering him with the same slurs he had been in the habit of using. The government (embodied by a doughy Food and Drug Administration bureaucrat) is more concerned with procedure than compassion. Doctors and pharmaceutical companies chase glory and profits at the expense of patients." though is the sense that Ron�۪s efforts are part of a larger movement. The problem is not that ���Dallas Buyers Club�۝ focuses on a straight hero acting mainly on behalf of gay men. Ron�۪s bravery and determination are entirely credible thanks to Mr. McConaughey�۪s disciplined high-spirited performance and the filmmakers�۪ interest in the complexity of the character. But his actions unfold in something of a vacuum. There is little sense of the militancy and passion chronicled for example in David France�۪s documentary ���How to Survive a Plague �۝ which brilliantly illuminated how the response to AIDS ��� as a political as well as a medical emergency ��� helped to transform gay life in America." ���Dallas Buyers Club�۝ presents the fable of a homophobe�۪s awakening with supporting roles given to Ms. Garner�۪s kind doctor and to Rayon (Jared Leto) a troubled transgender person who becomes Ron�۪s business partner. Mr. Leto is always a subtle and intriguing actor but Rayon essentially revives the ancient stereotype of the tragic self-destructive queen suffering operatically and depending at last on the kindness of strangers." I suspect to inject both a dash of camp and a surge of pathos into the movie but the character helps instead to confine it to the realm of simple and sentimental melodrama. There is warmth and intelligence here and undeniable sincerity but also a determination in the face of much painful and fascinating history to play it safe." death drugs and hateful language."

But the legacy she inherited is twofold.

�۝ Keanu Reeves�۪s down-and-dirty and generally diverting directing debut. A story about the past and the future the good and the bad the strong and the weak the movie finds a Januslike Mr. Reeves looking in two directions at once: toward the old-school kung fu movies of once upon a matinee time and the modern China emblemized by the high rises that slice through smog-swathed Beijing where most of the story unwinds. It�۪s there that Tiger (Tiger Chen) logs hours between lessons with a tai chi master Yang (Yu Hai)." Tiger has a serious qi (life force) problem. It controls him Master Yang warns rather than the reverse which leaves Tiger unbalanced (he�۪s more yang than yin) and opens the door for the ensuing narrative complications. ���Use four ounces to deflect 1 000 pounds �۝ advises a classic tai chi adage words that Tiger has a hard time embracing. Intent on proving that there�۪s more to tai chi than meditation and old people moving really slowly in public parks he competes in televised events that bring him to the attention of a wealthy fixer Donaka Mark one of those cackling villains played by Mr. Reeves himself in one of his few wrong moves here." ���Man of Tai Chi�۝ hits its largely generic paces efficiently introducing elements like a tough female Hong Kong cop Suen Jing-Si (the reliably sympathetic Karen Mok) who knows that Donaka is up to no good. Some scenes in the Hong Kong police station where Jing-Si and her supervisor Wong (the great Simon Yam) modestly thicken the thin plot and show that Mr. Reeves has watched his share of Hong Kong procedurals. While Jing-Si tries to figure out what role Donaka plays in illegal fights Donaka chases after Tiger to be his next underground champion slithering through the shadows as he feeds both Tiger�۪s vanity and empty pockets." �۝ Donaka observes of the fighting Tiger who locks arms and legs around bigger men who snap like twigs a comment that suggests Mr. Reeves knows exactly what his audience wants. Mr. Chen isn�۪t much of an actor and with his inexpressive face and stillness he tends to disappear into the background whenever he�۪s not fighting. Mr. Reeves seems to have figured this out and he keeps Mr. Chen in consistent beautiful motion ��� the fight choreographer is Yuen Wo Ping ��� staging many of the encounters inside an austere gray room. There men transform into gyroscopes as limbs and torsos spin and you are reminded once more that one of the enduring pleasures of cinema is watching the human body move."

Mr. Schreiber plays James a successful architect and terminal philanderer. But when his long-suffering wife Nina (Jeanne Tripplehorn slumming) finally leaves after finding him thrashing around with one of her closest friends their separation causes James to reassess his behavior. Is it possible that misogynistic alpha males are not every woman�۪s dream?" this piece of polished fluff (Joost van Gelder�۪s photography makes the film easier on the eyes than on the brain) exudes a casual disdain for women that�۪s consistently depressing. Rather than tend to their classy careers Nina and her friends drink and natter and enjoy morning jogs unhampered by decent support bras. And when one of James�۪s colleagues returns from Australia his assessment of Melbourne ��� ���It�۪s boring like having sex with your wife�۝ ��� is typical of his cohort�۪s romantic attitudes." James is a coldly repellent peg on which to hang a love story. Even his dog has more personality ��� and probably better morals."

Hence the Vegas excursion during which scores will be settled fences mended lessons learned and disasters predictably avoided." though a while after that you will be happy to see Mary Steenburgen playing a lounge singer who befriends our foursome and adds a pinch of dramatic spice to the proceedings.

Attention is also paid to Japan�۪s loving devotion to the Ninth known as Daiku which is sung in hundreds of concerts around the country every December." and adding even a brief discussion of the repression Beethoven saw rising in Europe would have lent invaluable context.

�۝ the boy brainiac Ender Wiggin stands on a podium waving his arms. A vast immersive image of outer space is spread out before him and if you didn�۪t know better you might think he was playing Wii on an Imax screen. It�۪s an amusingly self-reflexive moment in a humorless movie about children who play war games as part of their very grown-up military training. As he furiously moves spaceships and troops across computer screens he looks by turns like a superexcited kid an orchestra conductor Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerer�۪s Apprentice and even a Christ figure. Childhood can be tough in movies but rarely do screen children suffer for our sins as they do here." the movie envisions a future world ruled by a monolithic militaristic government that trains children to fight large insectlike extraterrestrials called Formics or buggers. When the story opens Ender (Asa Butterfield) thinks he�۪s just another runt with a monitor jammed in his neck that allows the authorities personified by Colonel Graff who because he�۪s played by Harrison Ford should have been called Gruff and a psychologist Major Anderson (Viola Davis) to observe each potential warrior�۪s words moods and tears. Graff believes that Ender may be the child to lead them all a sermon he preaches as Ender is tested first on Earth and then in the outer space battle school where the movie gets its game on." which he followed with several sequels has sold a zillion copies. The charismatic leader the divine child the possible Christ figure or potential Hitler stand-in (according to one notorious widely circulated reading): Ender Wiggin is an expediently malleable figure. In the novel he is also shades of the Spartans 6 when he ships off to battle school which puts a distinctly ugly spin on a scene in the book in which he methodically brutalizes a bully kicking the other boy repeatedly including in the face. Ender has logically decided that by crushing the other boy he will prevent future attacks a prophylactic philosophy that mirrors the authorities�۪ attitude toward the buggers. He�۪s 12 in the movie which doesn�۪t make that beating any better." and it�۪s hard not to think that it had to wait for the right anxious moment. In the 1950s adolescent alienation meant Sal Mineo�۪s Christ figure dying in the embrace of his surrogate parents in ���Rebel Without a Cause.�۝  Many years and sad stories later the kids are still not all right and while much remains the same much has changed including the familiar reality of the child who kills. Like the kids in the ���Harry Potter�۝ franchise and in ���The Hunger Games �۝ Ender and his schoolmates do have childish moments. Yet what�۪s striking about the children in these pop culture behemoths is that unlike in ���Rebel �۝ they aren�۪t allowed to pretend to be adults because the world compels them to assume those roles." despite Mr. Ford�۪s strained avuncularity and Ms. Davis�۪s flooding eyes. Ender is singled out because he seems to be a natural leader which in the logic of both the book and the movie means someone who imposes his will on enemy and friend alike. He�۪s rational and brutal which is a harder sell on the screen where every punch carries an unsettling intensity that the director Gavin Hood has trouble managing. Mr. Butterfield is one of those young performers whose seriousness feels as if it sprang from deep within. And while he�۪s an appealing presence little Ender can�۪t help feeling like a pint-size psycho." whose script winnows the novel into two hours of mostly action and a fair amount of talk does better once the story shifts to space. (Ender�۪s home where crammed bookshelves line one wall and his mother bustles alone in the kitchen like a 1950s housewife has a pointless antediluvian quality.) Among the dividends are a barking sergeant Dap (Nonso Anozie) and a giant geodesic-dome-like room in which trainees practice in zero gravity. It�۪s pleasant to watch these tiny untethered bodies float like cosmic motes and to follow Ender into an appealingly detailed animated computer game in which he tumbles down a rabbit hole and discovers a mystery that will presumably only be fully solved in the sequels. His tribulations are likely not over."

That is the ugly message of the Polish filmmaker Wladyslaw Pasikowski�۪s lurid ���Aftermath �۝ which delivers its Holocaust-related story with the clunking force of a blunt instrument slammed into the skull." the story was inspired by the July 1941 massacre in Jedwabne in northeast Poland. The Nazis approved the slaughter in which Jews were herded into a house that was burned to the ground. The perpetrators ascribed the disappearances to Nazi deportation and maintained a code of silence." but that�۪s not really its subject. The Kalina brothers Franek (Ireneusz Czop) and Jozek (Maciej Stuhr) reunite after a 20-year estrangement when Franek who has been living and working in Chicago returns to the village where Jozek remained to tend the family farm." Jozek�۪s wife and children abandoned him to live in the United States. Paradoxically both brothers are vocally anti-Semitic but because Jozek has been uncovering the town�۪s ugly secrets they are treated like pariahs." Jozek has vandalized a road by digging up Jewish gravestones that the Nazis used for a roadbed and moving them to the field outside his farmhouse where he has planted what amounts to an ad hoc cemetery. When Jozek is asked why he is consumed by the project all he says is ���They were human beings.�۝" and Franek is shadowed and treated with suspicion. A rock is thrown through a window of the farmhouse and anti-Semitic graffiti painted on the walls. Jozek�۪s dog is beheaded. One night his field is set ablaze and no one will help to put out the fire. While Jozek continues his excavations Franek plays detective and digs through old property records and makes a horrifying discovery." the movie�۪s vision of a hostile community turning on a suspected betrayer recalls Thomas Vinterberg�۪s ���The Hunt �۝ in which a Danish village ostracizes and persecutes a schoolteacher wrongly suspected of pedophilia. That movie portrayed irrational fear and hatred as a communicable disease that can lead to an epidemic of hysteria." whom the movie portrays as brutal peasants in a horror thriller feels built into them. With their menacing scowls grunts of contempt and anti-Semitic slurs they are monsters. Unlocking the past is akin to opening a crypt and releasing the undead.

This is gallant perhaps but also a bit creepy. Time travel is always kept secret from the ladies whose superpower is to pretend to be exasperated with men they unreservedly adore. This works for Mary and for Tim�۪s mother (Lindsay Duncan). His sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) is a sadder case. Her whimsy and cleverness lead her to alcoholism and a bad boyfriend and it falls to her brother to rescue her from the consequences of her choices." frictionless bliss of television commercials in which people are good-looking and superficially clever without actually being interesting. Occasional bouts of sorrow or uncertainty make Tim a better person: not just better than his old self but also better (in spite of his stammering demurrals) than everybody else. Including you." though Ms. McAdams endures both him and an unfortunate hairstyle with her usual aplomb. (What is her thing with temporal wanderers by the way? First there was Eric Bana in ���The Time Traveler�۪s Wife �۝ then Owen Wilson in ���Midnight in Paris.�۝ Now this.) Mr. Nighy and Tom Hollander (as a playwright pal of Tim�۪s father�۪s) provide a bit of old-school grumpiness (though not enough) and Joshua McGuire (as a tongue-tied co-worker of Tim�۪s) suggests frontiers of diffidence yet to be conquered." when it�۪s over that you could borrow Tim�۪s skill reclaim the two hours and buy a ticket for something else.

however tempting poses visual challenges (or exhausts the imagination of the filmmaker). That problem is the focus of ���Golden Slumbers �۝ a film about Cambodian cinema a history wiped clean by the Khmer Rouge. In the hands of the filmmaker Davy Chou that vanished past becomes a remembered fantasy expressing the absence of much more than a couple of hundred missing melodramas." films were destroyed and cinemas were left to rot as part of the Khmer Rouge�۪s genocidal purge (which has been the subject of other Cambodian documentaries notably those of Rithy Panh). Mr. Chou a grandson of a prominent producer from an earlier era gleans traces of this erased history (mostly 1960-1975) by interviewing surviving directors (such as Ly Bun Yim) and a star actress Dy Saveth who is now a dance instructor. He tantalizingly postpones showing us clips from these lost films or from providing the reassurance that any do or do not exist." though we�۪re not spared these filmmakers�۪ sense of loss (some of it still raw or scarred over with a certain hardness). ���Golden Slumbers�۝ portrays the cinema of the past as a benevolent haunting spirit using beautiful photography and contemplative long slow dolly shots. These techniques endow the film�۪s locales alternately lush and barren with a sense of wistful even beautiful desolation. Songs from the missing films echo through ���Golden Slumbers�۝ as if the film itself were an empty old cinema." half-surprised that he remembers the faces of star actors from the past more than the faces of his own family. Mr. Chou taps into something profound about the dream life of a nation with this moment as he does with shots of a cavernous former theater that became a makeshift residence (and that partly recalls the nook-filled theater in Tsai Ming-liang�۪s ���Goodbye Dragon Inn�۝)." ���Golden Slumbers�۝ has a tendency to wallow in its romanticism not to the point of trivializing its history but definitely dropping off into somnolence. Its use of a structuring absence sometimes just comes across as a slackness in the film�۪s treatment. But as light and unearthly as the missing films may sound now (bearing titles like ���Out of the Nest�۝ or ���The Sad Life�۝) Mr. Chou�۪s documentary shows how they are no trivial matter even in the shadow of an inexpressibly terrible crime."

This dissonance between sight and sound is only one of the many contrasts that define this contemplative study of a young priest whose repressed desires threaten to derail his chosen vocation." Father Adam (Andrzej Chyra) enjoys rowdy meals and knockabout soccer games with the pack of delinquent teenagers he cheerfully oversees. Medicating his urges with incessant jogging and occasional drinking he�۪s nevertheless undone by two new acquaintances: a delicate young parishioner (Mateusz Kosciukiewicz) whose Christlike appearance and tongue-tied vulnerability prove irresistible and a platinum-haired sexual aggressor (Tomasz Schuchardt) who recognizes a kindred spirit." Ms. Szumowska juxtaposes two-person scenes of wordless intimacy with group expressions of casual violence. In one disturbing episode a girl having a seizure is surrounded by impassively staring villagers; in another a gaggle of thugs feeds ants to the local simpleton." we realize that there is no empathy here ��� even the restless wife who propositions Adam is motivated by boredom ��� and tenderness is virtually nonexistent.

So when he travels to India to work on another film project and is too debilitated to finish he cheerfully experiments with alternative therapies for his disease.

���the people�۝ is a great abstraction an idea that can be invoked to justify noble projects and terrible crimes. ���The Square �۝ Jehane Noujaim�۪s stunning new documentary is partly about the contested status of the Egyptian people between the winter of 2011 when crowds of protesters gathered in Tahrir Square to demand the removal of President Hosni Mubarak and the summer of 2013 when the army ousted his successor Mohamed Morsi and began a violent campaign against his followers in the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr. Morsi the military and the demonstrators ��� and for that matter Mr. Mubarak himself ��� all claimed to be true agents and loyal servants of the popular will." nonabstract flesh-and-blood people who represent a cross-section of Egyptian society even as their experiences defy easy generalization. In the early optimistic days of what became known as the Arab Spring they are united in anger idealism and hope. The solidarity they find with one another while occupying a vast public space in the center of Cairo feels like a harbinger of the free inclusive democratic nation they so passionately desire. What follows is confusion disappointment and betrayal a story that non-Egyptians may know from news reports but one that has not yet been told with such rousing and heartbreaking clarity." Ms. Noujaim (���Startup.com �۝ ���Control Room�۝) and her team of brave tireless camera operators ��� shooting at street level and from high-rise buildings above the square ��� capture the excitement of a mass movement finding its voice and feeling its potential. There are anti-Mubarak songs and chants and intense thrilling arguments about the nature and meaning of the democracy. After decades of oppression and frustration a new reality suddenly seems possible." a young man from a working-class Cairo neighborhood is an exuberant guide to the Tahrir scene sharing tea and cigarettes with students children and workers. Friendly and tireless he speaks the always appealing slightly na��ve language of joy liberation and renewal. The swift fall of Mubarak seems to him like a dream come true." the son of an exiled Egyptian dissident and an actor who has appeared in movies like ���The Kite Runner�۝ and ���United 93.�۝ He and his father who discuss unfolding events via video chats are part of the liberal intelligentsia suppressed and marginalized by the old regime. Magdy Ashour is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood for decades the largest and most formidable opposition group. Aida El Kashef among the first demonstrators to occupy Tahrir is a filmmaker and Ramy Essam a singer and songwriter who became the bard of the uprising." open-minded and informal ��� of youthful disaffection. There are also representatives of older generations of dissidents who are at once delighted by the activism of the young and anxious about what will become of them." as his longstanding fealty to the Brotherhood is challenged by his newfound affection for Ahmed and other secular-minded protesters. At one point when members of the Brotherhood are instructed by their leaders to leave Tahrir Magdy decides to stay and as Mr. Morsi�۪s actions in office cause resentment and division he suffers a crisis of loyalty made all the more poignant by the warmth and generosity of his temperament." it still feels like a revelation. This is partly because of the immediacy of Ms. Noujaim�۪s approach which often puts the viewer in the midst of chaos as it unfolds. You may know what is coming ��� the clearing of Tahrir by the army after Mr. Mubarak�۪s departure; the tensions before Mr. Morsi�۪s election and the violence against the Coptic Christian minority afterward; the anti-Morsi demonstrations leading up to his ouster this past summer ��� but you witness it all in a state of suspense and agitation." you may also understand it better than you did before. This fearless exercise in political reportage is also a formidable if necessarily raw work of political thought. Ms. Noujaim�۪s sympathies are clearly with those who refer to themselves as ���revolutionaries�۝ ��� a word that comes to signify resistance to both the Brotherhood and the military ��� but she is hardly blind to their limitations. The revolutionaries are able to compel the world�۪s attention and sympathy and to risk life and limb in defiance of authority but they have neither the organizational discipline nor the strategic ability to assume and exercise power. Lacking weapons or a party apparatus they become pawns and bystanders in an increasingly lethal struggle between forces more ruthless and less principled than they." not only for Ahmed and his friends but also it�۪s fair to say for the Egyptian people as a whole. But ���The Square �۝ while it records the gruesome collision of utopian aspirations with cold political realities is not a despairing film. It concludes on a note of resolve grounded in the acknowledgment that historical change can be a long slow process. It suggests that the Egyptian revolution after a glorious birth and a blighted infancy is still at Square 1."

�۝ Ridley Scott�۪s terrifying implacable new movie opens on a seductive scene. The setting is a softly lighted bedroom in which two people are murmuring sweet dirty nothings under a white sheet. You don�۪t see who they are until there�۪s a cut to under the sheet bringing you close enough to Michael Fassbender and Pen̩lope Cruz to feel like an interloper." these two beauties search each other�۪s bodies with tender looks and caresses her lashes fluttering at his touch. It�۪s as if they were adrift in ���the world of light�۝ of Mount Olympus described by Homer in ���The Odyssey �۝ that place where ���gods live their days of pleasure.�۝" few as mercilessly or memorably as those in ���The Counselor �۝ a tale of good and evil but because it was written by Cormac McCarthy mostly evil. Mr. Fassbender plays the title character a corrupt unnamed high-flying Texas lawyer. He moves fast as does this film which soon jumps from Olympus to a garage in Mexico where men and dogs slip through shadows then jumps north of the border where another woman rides a horse flanked by a cheetah chasing a jack rabbit. The hare escapes in a swirl of dust but by the end of this scene Mr. Scott has seized your attention with a primitive predatory vision one red in tooth and claw." Malkina (Cameron Diaz scary and freaky) profoundly less so. Both live with Reiner (an excellent Javier Bardem) and a second cheetah in a lavish desert compound a kind of a Donatella Versace delirium with bulbous bodybuilders manning the gates and sleek rides purring in the drive." Reiner has a dangerous sideline doing business with a drug cartel with which he has negotiated a deal involving the Counselor. It hinges on a huge coke shipment that�۪s under way when the movie opens putting you in the midst of an operation you have to catch up to even as the Counselor hurtles forward hopscotching from place to place as other characters enter and exit." as well as the eccentric mesmerizing poetry of his dialogue Mr. McCarthy appears to have never read a screenwriting manual in his life. (That�۪s a compliment; this is his first produced film script.) Although there�۪s a fairly blunt near-archetypal aspect to the main characters ��� their expensive homes sports cars and designer clothes speak the language of money fluently ��� the plot remains deliberately unobvious for a long time. A truck rumbles out of a garage and somewhere else a motorcyclist breaks the speed of sound on a highway. In between the Counselor has long conversations ��� filled with jokes archaic words odd cadences and frightening anecdotes ��� with both Reiner and another man Westray (Brad Pitt) a philosophical cowboy in a white Stetson and tailored Western suit." but there�۪s a clarity solidity and stillness (the camera moves but doesn�۪t tremble) to his images that augment the narrative�۪s gravity and inexorable momentum. The beauty of the landscapes is about all that feels coherent in an often unrecognizable unsettling world." Laura (Ms. Cruz) the natural world is a reminder of another reality beyond the brutal one the cartel Westray and the others have made. And it�۪s these reminders that anchor you if only during the progressively unnerving hour when you don�۪t know what is happening but do know ��� from the menacing talk to the grim-reaper smiles ��� that it will turn out badly." sly as a fox and Reiner his face jutting into the frame like a cathedral gargoyle share bloody tales that only make ghastly sense later. This is no country for anyone." someone says something that puts the stakes and intensifying throb of fear into unambiguous perspective. Westray tells the Counselor that the cartel will ���rip out your liver and feed it to your dog.�۝ This isn�۪t a warning; it�۪s a statement of fact." �۝ he later says while driving his Bentley ���is up against the wall.�۝ Mr. Fassbender softening his face and speaking with the measured calm of a reasonable thinking man makes the Counselor seem too rational for this madness." methodical almost surgical and entirely thrill-free ��� does come; the surprise is how long it takes to arrive. This delay of the inevitable worst helps amplify the dread your trepidation stoked by Reiner and Westray�۪s stories Malkina�۪s dead-eyed stare the prowling cheetahs and the rumbling truck." but in Mr. McCarthy he has found a partner with convictions about good and evil rather than canned formula. The movie�۪s title may make cruel sense ��� the Counselor is a man who himself takes no counsel ��� but a truer encapsulation of its worldview is ���No Exit.�۝"

generous exhausting love story the chronicle of a young woman�۪s passage from curiosity to heartbreak by way of a wrenching and blissful attachment to another slightly older woman. Although there is plenty of weeping and sighing the methods of the director Abdellatif Kechiche are less melodramatic than meteorological. He studies the radar and scans the horizon in search of emotional weather patterns and then rushes out into the gale dragging the audience through fierce winds and soul-battering squalls." she gives every appearance when we first encounter her of being an ordinary French teenager: running to catch the morning bus to school daydreaming in class trading gossip with her friends in the cafeteria. Her transformation before our eyes and in close-ups that register every stray tendril of hair and fluctuation of skin tone is not necessarily into anything more extraordinary. The child of a lower-middle-class family in the northern industrial city of Lille Ad̬le is pointedly and contentedly modest in her ambitions. She likes reading and eating (especially her father�۪s spaghetti) and aspires to a career as a schoolteacher." over the course of nearly three hours and what seems like about a half-dozen years (Mr. Kechiche is not fussy about marking the passage of time) Ad̬le acquires a depth and grandeur that make her equal to some of the great heroines of literature. For a while as with Anna Karenina or Elizabeth Bennet or Clarissa Dalloway her life is also yours and afterward you may discover that yours has altered as a result of the encounter." �۝ a sprawling unfinished doorstop of a book by the 18th-century author Pierre de Marivaux. (In the movie Ad̬le calls it her favorite novel.) The film�۪s focus is nonetheless resolutely contemporary and its achievement decidedly cinematic. Immersing us in the everyday facts of 21st-century French life ��� including school politics food wine and sex ��� Mr. Kechiche illuminates the suffering and ecstasy of an awakening consciousness." and her reality her ways of seeing and feeling define the many shades of ���Blue.�۝ Mr. Kechiche�۪s earlier films include ���The Secret of the Grain �۝ a similarly messy and capacious consideration of the life of a North African immigrant in France and his extended family and ���Games of Love and Chance�۝ (���L�۪Esquive�۝) which sets a Marivaux comedy in a rough housing project in the Paris suburbs. He rarely allows the machinery of plot to distract him from the tangents of talk and the first part of ���Blue�۝ is preoccupied with what seem to be extraneous trivial arguments and conversations. Ad̬le chats about boys with the girls at school and about music and books with a boy named Thomas (J̩r̩mie Laheurte) who briefly becomes her boyfriend. She naps snacks studies and pushes her unruly hair into a ragged ponytail atop her head." she crosses paths with Emma (L̩a Seydoux) and everything changes. Emma blue-haired and fox-eyed walks past Ad̬le in the street shows up in her dreams and flirts with her in a lesbian bar. ���I came here by chance �۝ Ad̬le says which is only half-true. She was not exactly looking for Emma or for anyone in particular but rather for confirmation of a hunch about her own desires something Emma is happy to provide." an art student and an aspiring painter relishes the role of mentor. A bit pompously she lectures Ad̬le on the ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre ��� she sees him not altogether implausibly as a forerunner of gay liberation ��� and offers to tutor her in philosophy. Later when they are more or less securely established as a couple Emma prods Ad̬le toward loftier ambitions almost as if she is embarrassed to be with someone so down to earth." she is served oysters and high-flown conversation about the value of culture. At Ad̬le�۪s house Emma eats pasta and gets a paternal talking-to about the frivolity of art and the importance of making a living. Emma is proudly out. Ad̬le is somewhat defiantly closeted. There are unspoken tensions and imbalances between them that eventually erupt with shattering force." headed by Steven Spielberg took the unusual step of awarding the festival�۪s highest prize jointly to Mr. Kechiche Ms. Exarchopoulos and Ms. Seydoux ��� much attention was paid to its explicit sex scenes. Not without reason. One sequence in particular is longer and more literal than anything you are likely to encounter outside of pornography. Ms. Maroh (among others) objected that Mr. Kechiche�۪s rendering of her work was indeed pornographic reflecting a prurient male fantasy rather than the truth of lesbian sex." as does an earlier scene in which Ad̬le and Emma visit a museum and gaze at paintings and sculptures of naked women almost all of them produced by men. The conversation features a male gallery owner who rambles on breathlessly about the power and mystery of female sexuality which has fascinated male artists for centuries." as is Emma herself ��� underlines the theme. All this talk may be an attempt by Mr. Kechiche to cover his own backside while Ms. Exarchopoulos�۪s and Ms. Seydoux�۪s are on full undraped display. Like Titian or Degas or Flaubert he just can�۪t help it." cerebral and emotional. The sex is essential to that intention even though Mr. Kechiche�۪s way of filming does not quite succeed in fulfilling it. Trying to push the boundaries of empathy to communicate physical rapture by visual means he bumps into the limits of the medium and lapses into voyeurism turning erotic sensation into a spectacle of flesh." given the scale of this movie�۪s achievement which belongs equally (as the Cannes jury recognized) to the director and the actresses. The film is at times as sloppy as its heroine with her runny nose and unruly hair but it is never dull lazy or predictable. Mr. Kechiche�۪s style is dizzy obsessive inspired and relentless words that also describe Ad̬le and Emma and the fearless women who embody them.

Whether falling-down drunk or messed up on mushrooms James and his friends are a tiresome tribe of slackers whose unappetizing self-abuse is detailed with documentarylike precision. But when a beautiful college student named Sara (Sara Anne Jones) joins the group and begins an avid descent into substance-assisted experience her fixation on a wooded road supposedly dotted with seven gateways to hell will drag James and the plot in a completely new and disturbing direction."

at least a little bit the high-flying wheeler-dealers who recently brought the world to the brink of economic collapse and were never held accountable? As you watch the Costa-Gavras financial thriller ���Capital �۝ it may rekindle some of the rage and fear that people felt when the pillars trembled." because its characters are so ridiculously evil. It doesn�۪t get sillier than a scene at a meeting where the chief executive proclaims ���I�۪m your Robin Hood ��� we�۪ll keep robbing the poor to give to the rich �۝ and is answered with tumultuous cheering and stomping." �۝ from ���Wall Street.�۝ But the best it can come up with is ���Money is the master �۝ the motto of Dittmar Rigule (Gabriel Byrne) a reptilian hedge fund manager based in Miami whose fund has borrowed money to take over the fictional Phenix bank in France. Nothing less than a 20 percent annual yield can keep the bank afloat. Dittmar is the movie�۪s only character to convey an enjoyment of the mischief he stirs up not to mention a voluptuous appreciation for the perks of wealth. He slyly refers to the beauties lounging on his yacht as ���the fauna.�۝" Phenix�۪s fish-eyed interim leader who is given the reins after its chief executive has a heart attack on a golf course. Like Kevin Spacey�۪s Frank Underwood in ���House of Cards �۝ Marc occasionally turns to address the camera and let us know the full extent of his duplicity and greed." the left-leaning Greek-French director of ���Z�۝ and ���Missing �۝ would seem to be the ideal filmmaker for an anti-capitalist screed. But the movie based on St̩phane Osmont�۪s 2004 novel of the same title is stiff and didactic.

�۝ members of the Vienna Boys Choir clad in its traditional sailor suits arrive in a rowboat on what is apparently the shore of New Zealand and plunges into welcome rituals with Maori people. The situation almost recalls a memorable scene from ���Lord of the Flies �۝ in which a storm-tossed choir sings ���Kyrie eleison�۝ in procession on a beach but the photography here has the color cranked way up and a plummy National Geographic-style voice-over pours forth platitudes and edifying narration." amusingly eager to distract and rather entertaining the film resembles a children�۪s travel show with music-video elements more than it resembles a straight-up documentary. The veteran director Curt Faudon stages scenes featuring the choir charming Indian villagers with a Hindi song or hilariously accompanying two guitarists in an open train through Peru hobo style. Mr. Faudon uses green screens and keeps the camera circling cutting away to calendar-ready shots of landscapes gardens and that rowboat. At one point a boy holds a sextant aloft." the choristers are often arrayed as carefully as figures on an album cover. There are ���real�۝ scenes about audition processes for this international choir though ���Bridging the Gap�۝ is preoccupied with the notion of one-world unity (reaching a climax with a song absurdly performed over a montage of hurricane destruction). But the visual pretensions are rooted in an unashamed passion about the music and when the narrator is explaining Schubert�۪s ���Trout�۝ Quintet there�۪s the sense of being in a choir with an enthusiastic if kooky music teacher."

�۝ the new grimly beautiful and somewhat unhinged film from the French director Claire Denis enter wearing masks. These are not the usual monsters that slink through the shadows growling and prowling while baring sharp teeth and talons. The evil here slips into the back seat of chauffeured cars and smiles a dazzling white smile before grasping a child�۪s hand patting a woman�۪s arm or slipping in a metaphoric knife. Evil like this only needs metaphoric weapons: power makes its bearers dirty but also keeps them clean." well so too are the method and allure of Ms. Denis�۪s work whose films include ���Beau Travail�۝ and more recently ���White Material.�۝ In ���White Material�۝ Ms. Denis set her gaze by turns cool and blistering on an unnamed African country ravaged by violence including that of European colonialism; it�۪s a movie that serves as companion piece to her first feature ���Chocolat �۝ set in 1950s Cameroon. She has returned to Paris for ���Bastards �۝ with a story that has the tragic undertow of a classic Greek tragedy and the topicality of a headline in Le Monde. At center are two families locked in a vicious brutally personal struggle over money a violence which as is sometimes the case with Ms. Denis�۪s films takes a catastrophic toll on vulnerably human bodies." Ms. Denis introduces the story�۪s individual elements: after receiving an S O S Marco Silvestri (Vincent Lindon) a captain on a supertanker returns to Paris. Marco�۪s brother-in-law has died his sister is on the verge of bankruptcy and about to lose the family shoe factory and his niece has been badly injured. He writes checks for his sister Sandra (Julie Bataille) and visits his niece Justine (Lola Cr̩ton). He also moves into a sprawling apartment throwing a mattress on the polished parquet floor and begins watching a neighbor Rapha��lle (Chiara Mastroianni) who lives with her young son Joseph (Yann Antoine Bizette). She turns out to be the mistress of a wealthy older man a man with a dazzling smile Edouard Laporte (Michel Subor)." Ms. Denis fills the movie with close-ups that give you a searching intimacy with the characters allowing you to explore the creases in Mr. Lindon�۪s face and the curve of Ms. Cr̩ton�۪s lips. These close-ups feel existentially driven (Ms. Denis has no use for exposition): they don�۪t serve the usual narrative functions simply because the characters are often alone initially. The people here spend a lot of time in solitary mulling suggestive silence a pointed contrast to the compulsory clamor of so many movies. And even when they talk to each other their conversations are fragmented sometimes cryptic and tend to open in medias res forcing you to catch up. They already know what they�۪re doing just like in real life." and the way that she puts all these images including her expressive faces into play with the fragmented dialogue and vaporous themes. Slowly effortlessly the pieces ��� the money the sex the bodies ��� begin to drift into place: Justine is involved with a pimp Xavier (Gr̩goire Colin) who runs a sex show out of a farmhouse. Her family�۪s factory plays a role as does her dead father and Edouard who looms over the story as a kind of monstrous patriarch. The story grips you entirely even if Ms. Denis�۪s worldview here finally feels like a tomb: terrifying pitiless inevitable."

These early scenes shot close in with a hand-held camera that accentuates the chaos set the film�۪s tone: unblinking human scale. We see a body on fire staggering down the street and Shahid (an unflashy Raj Kumar Yadav) running to reach home." from which Shahid flees and when he�۪s a prisoner at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai where two older wiser inmates (one played by the charismatic Kay Kay Menon) school him. The system Mr. Menon�۪s character tells Shahid ���takes time but it works �۝ a proposition that the film believes even as it shows the ways it doesn�۪t." exposing prejudice and trumped-up evidence. Mr. Mehta clearly relishes the courtroom atmosphere. These scenes set in slightly shabby spaces with plastic chairs and rickety fans have a quarrelsome pop. In one sharp bit Shahid points out that a pristine map could hardly have been in the pocket of blood-soaked pants for two days as the prosecution claims. (Good point the judge says.)" in particular feels truncated and overstuffed as it deals with strains in Shahid�۪s family life and a rush of court cases. Still Mr. Mehta has done something difficult.

for those of us in the audience contending with yakkers and texters and for the people on screen as well. The lonesome strangers of the old westerns almost always had a town to ride into or out of a buzz of social life to contrast with their individualistic ways. Even movies that emphasize the isolation of their main characters tend to provide them with companions human or otherwise. Piscine Patel in ���Life of Pi�۝ had his tiger Richard Parker; Chuck Noland in ���Cast Away�۝ had Wilson the volleyball. Those guys did a lot of talking even when nobody else was around." giving the performance of his life ��� says almost nothing at all. For the duration of the film he is the only person in sight. In the opening scene we hear his voice as he composes a letter of apology and farewell presumably to unspecified loved ones back home. Later ��� or rather earlier since most of the story flashes back from that moment of fatalism eight days into his ordeal ��� he tries to send a distress call over the radio and tosses a few epithets at his fate. Otherwise he is silent. And though this man�۪s radical aloneness is terrifying to him and to us it is also a condition he has chosen one we might even envy just as his taciturn competence is something we are inclined to admire." in the empty waters between Indonesia and Madagascar on a solo sailing voyage.

He�۪s rich American and handsome. (He�۪s Robert Redford.)" understated confidence. In the midst of a desperate crisis he takes the time to shave and we might wonder whether this act of grooming under duress is evidence of self-discipline or vanity. Even when he is absorbed in practical matters that have life-or-death consequences our ancient mariner maintains a sense of style; there is a subtle self-consciousness in his efforts to embody the old Hemingway-esque ideal of grace under pressure. He is a model of masculine virtue and he knows it. (He�۪s Robert Redford.)" our loyalty our love ��� with such efficiency. Mr. Redford has always been a magnificent underplayer a master of small clear gestures and soft-spoken intensity. This role brings him to the pinnacle of reticence but also allows him to open up in startling ways. Behind the leathery pragmatic exterior is a reservoir of inexpressible emotion. An opera thunders in the silence." �۝ an action movie in the most profound and exalted sense of the term has a simple plot that I hesitate to summarize less for fear of spoiling anything than because a pr̩cis would either miss the point or recapitulate the whole film. A lot goes wrong. An errant shipping container punches a hole in the hull. The cabin floods and the onboard electrical system is ruined. A ferocious storm spins tosses and smashes the boat. Attempts to communicate are foiled by rotten luck and the metaphysical indifference of the universe." the man perseveres in his patient problem-solving way. He patches his beloved boat�۪s wound with epoxy and cloth hauls out the storm jib gathers provisions for the lifeboat and digs up a never-used old-fashioned mariner�۪s sextant. Using this a sheaf of maps and a copy of ���Celestial Navigation for Yachtsmen �۝ he sets a course for commercial shipping lanes hoping for rescue from the big boats that were indirectly but with unmistakable metaphorical significance the cause of his predicament." Jack London Joseph Conrad and Herman Melville ��� ���All Is Lost�۝ manifests a strong allegorical undercurrent. Nothing registers the fragility and contingency of the human presence in the universe quite as starkly as the sight of a small vessel adrift on an endless ocean and few representations of heroism are as vivid as the spectacle of an individual fighting to master the caprices of wind and water." ready-made for high school term paper analysis. The physical details that carry the story and make it suspenseful and absorbing are also vessels of specific meaning and together they add up to a fable about the soul of man under global capitalism. Our man is a privileged consumer (just look at all the stuff he has on that boat) whose fate is set in motion by a box full of goods (children�۪s sneakers as it happens) accidentally knocked out of circulation." �۝ Mr. Chandor�۪s excellent first feature. That movie about an office full of panicky investment bankers dealing with the unfolding financial crisis of 2008 is in many ways the opposite of ���All Is Lost.�۝ It takes place almost entirely indoors and it�۪s pretty much all talk. But it is also very much concerned with how powerful men react when their sense of control is challenged and with the vast invisible system that sustains their illusions." and shades of ambiguity and implication filter in through the sharply defined crisply composed images of his struggle. I�۪m reminded again of Conrad and not only because ���All Is Lost�۝ is an appealing and exciting maritime adventure with one eye on the geopolitical state of the world." to make you feel ��� it is before all to make you see.�۝" even with the advantage of a visual medium and Mr. Chandor more than fulfills Conrad�۪s criterion of artistic achievement: ���If I succeed you shall find there according to your deserts: encouragement consolation fear charm ��� all you demand ��� and perhaps also that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask.�۝"

James Toback�۪s documentary ���Seduced and Abandoned�۝ provides the vicarious thrill of being at the table. You listen as financial movers and shakers coldly calculate the box-office potential of a project half-jokingly pitched by Mr. Toback and his sidekick Alec Baldwin as ���Last Tango in Tikrit.�۝" hateful and obscene that it still shocks. But with the proliferation of Internet pornography sex doesn�۪t sell movies the way it did in the 1970s. It�۪s almost inconceivable that Mr. Toback didn�۪t know that when he went to Cannes to hawk his concept." �۝ which is amply stuffed with real-life stars including Ryan Gosling Jessica Chastain and Diane Kruger suggests a game within a game. (In addition to its theatrical release the film will have a premiere on HBO on Oct. 28.) Because there is no visible script or treatment for Mr. Toback�۪s idea you wonder how serious he really is. Or is the trip just a pretext for making a movie about the film business hanging out with friends and schmoozing on the French Riviera?" the outlines of the project vary from pitch to pitch. Nobody is interested financing in a picture starring Ms. Campbell and even Mr. Baldwin�۪s movie-star power is regarded with skepticism since he has mostly forsaken films for television. Along the way ���Seduced and Abandoned�۝ documents Mr. Toback�۪s personal obsessions with sex and death and with Ms. Campbell who starred in his 2004 flop ���When Will I Be Loved?�۝" �۝ which uses split screens much of the time rambles entertainingly from topic to topic. It begins with a complaint ascribed to Orson Welles that he spent 95 percent of his life running around trying to raise money for movies and 5 percent making them. There is hardly a dull moment. It presents an informal gossipy history of the Cannes Film Festival and includes interviews with major directors including Mr. Bertolucci; Martin Scorsese who reminisces about ���Mean Streets�۝; Francis Ford Coppola who describes ���The Godfather�۝ as ���a fluke�۝; and Roman Polanski. There is a lot of talk about the gap between commerce and art and Mr. Gosling offers amusing recollections of his early days in Hollywood." Mr. Toback is a figure of Wellesian proportions who is unflappable in the face of probable rejection. Welles was always aware of his own myth which he unabashedly exploited in any way he could for personal gain. The same might be said of Mr. Toback a notorious wheeler-dealer who even by Hollywood standards is a character with a capital C. At Cannes he seems blissfully happy in his element rejection or not. ���Seduced and Abandoned�۝ may be the year�۪s most entertaining put-on."

it tells the true story of Solomon Northup an African-American freeman who in 1841 was snatched off the streets of Washington and sold. It�۪s at once a familiar utterly strange and deeply American story in which the period trappings long beloved by Hollywood ��� the paternalistic gentry with their pretty plantations their genteel manners and all the fiddle-dee-dee rest ��� are the backdrop for an outrage." when Solomon living in New York with his wife and children accepts a job from a pair of white men to play violin in a circus. Soon the three are enjoying a civilized night out in Washington sealing their camaraderie with heaping plates of food flowing wine and the unstated conviction ��� if only on Solomon�۪s part ��� of a shared humanity a fiction that evaporates when he wakes the next morning shackled and discovers that he�۪s been sold. Thereafter he is passed from master to master." following him as he travels from auction house to plantation to linger long in the emotions and ideas that the movie churns up. Part of this is pragmatic ��� Mr. McQueen wants to keep you in your seat not force you out of the theater sobbing ��� but there�۪s something else at work here. This is he insists a story about Solomon who may represent an entire subjugated people and by extension the peculiar institution as well as the American past and present. Yet this is also emphatically the story of one individual." the real Northup was born into freedom. (His memoir�۪s telegraphing subtitle is ���Narrative of Solomon Northup a Citizen of New-York Kidnapped in Washington City in 1841 and Rescued in 1853 From a Cotton Plantation Near the Red River in Louisiana.�۝) That made him an exceptional historical witness because even while he was inside slavery ��� physically psychologically emotionally ��� part of him remained intellectually and culturally at a remove which gives his book a powerful double perspective. In the North he experienced some of the privileges of whiteness and while he couldn�۪t vote he could enjoy an outing with his family. Even so he was still a black man in antebellum America." ���Hunger�۝ and ���Shame �۝ both of which were embalmed in self-promoting visuals. ���Hunger�۝ is the sort of art film that makes a show of just how perfectly its protagonist the Irish dissident Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender) smears his excrement on a prison wall. ���Shame �۝ about a sex addict (Mr. Fassbender again) was little more than glossy surfaces canned misery and preening directorial virtuosity. For ���12 Years a Slave �۝ by contrast Mr. McQueen has largely dispensed with the conventions of art cinema to make something close to a classical narrative; in this movie the emphasis isn�۪t on visual style but on Solomon and his unmistakable desire for freedom." softly inviting face and he initially plays the character with the stunned bewilderment of a man who even chained can�۪t believe what is happening to him. Not long after he�۪s kidnapped Solomon sits huddled with two other prisoners on a slaver�۪s boat headed south. One man insists that they should fight their crew. A second disagrees saying ���Survival�۪s not about certain death it�۪s about keeping your head down.�۝ Seated between them Solomon shakes his head no. Days earlier he was home. ���Now �۝ he says ���you tell me all is lost?�۝ For him mere survival cannot be enough. ���I want to live.�۝" and an assertion of his humanity that sustains him. It�۪s also a seamlessly structured scene that turns a discussion about the choices facing enslaved people ��� fight submit live ��� into cinema. In large part ���12 Years a Slave�۝ is an argument about American slavery that in image after image both reveals it as a system (signified in one scene by the sights and ominous mechanical sounds of a boat water wheel) and demolishes its canards myths and cherished symbols. There are no lovable masters here or cheerful slaves. There are also no messages wagging fingers or final-act summations or sermons. Mr. McQueen�۪s method is more effective and subversive because of its primarily old-fashioned Hollywood-style engagement." which is why it�۪s easy to name exceptions like Richard Fleischer�۪s demented at times dazzling 1975 film ���Mandingo.�۝ The greater jolt though is that ���12 Years a Slave�۝ isn�۪t about another Scarlett O�۪Hara but about a man who could be one of those anonymous bent-over black bodies hoeing fields in the opening credits of ���Gone With the Wind �۝ a very different ���story of the Old South.�۝" which was published a year after ���Uncle Tom�۪s Cabin�۝ and eight years before the start of the Civil War he interrupts an account of his own near-lynching to comment on the man largely to blame for the noose around his neck. ���But whatever motive may have governed the cowardly and malignant tyrant �۝ he writes ���it is of no importance.�۝ It doesn�۪t matter why Northup was strung up in a tree like a dead deer in the summer sun bathed in sweat with little water to drink. What matters is what has often been missing among the economic social and cultural explanations of American slavery and in many of its representations: human suffering. ���My wrists and ankles and the cords of my legs and arms began to swell burying the rope that bound them into the swollen flesh.�۝" with texture and sweep scenes of slavery�۪s extreme privations and cruelties but also its work rhythms and routines sunup to sundown along with the unsettling intimacies it produced among the owners and the owned. In Louisiana Solomon is sold by a brutish trader (Paul Giamatti) to an outwardly decent plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) who in turn sells him to a madman and drunk Edwin Epps (Mr. Fassbender). In his memoir Northup refers to Ford charitably doubtless for the benefit of the white readers who were the target of his abolitionist appeal. Freed from that burden the filmmakers can instead show the hypocrisies of such paternalism." and then hardens. It�۪s also where the existential reality of what it meant to be enslaved hour after hour decade after decade generation after generation is laid bare at times on the flayed backs of Epps�۪s human property including that of his brutalized favorite Patsey (Lupita Nyong�۪o). Mr. Fassbender skittish and weirdly spiderlike grabs your attention with curdled intensity. He�۪s so arresting that at first it seems as if the performance will soon slip out of Mr. McQueen�۪s control and that the character will become just another irresistibly watchable flamboyant heavy. Movie villainy is so easy partly because it allows actors to showboat but also because a lot of filmmakers can�۪t resist siding with power." �۝ including the cleareyed unsentimental quality of its images ��� this is a place where trees hang with beautiful moss and black bodies ��� and how Mr. Ejiofor�۪s restrained open translucent performance works as a ballast something to cling onto especially during the frenzies of violence. These are rightly hard to watch and bring to mind the startling moment in ���Maus �۝ Art Spiegelman�۪s cartoon opus about the Holocaust in which he asks his ���shrink�۝ to explain what it felt like to be in Auschwitz. ���Boo! It felt like that. But ALWAYS!�۝ The genius of ���12 Years a Slave�۝ is its insistence on banal evil and on terror that seeped into souls bound bodies and reaped an enduring terrible price."

Maryam (Mahnoor Baloch) a poised Pakistani-American real estate agent and Lea (Dendrie Taylor) a struggling office cleaner form a tentative friendship. But when Maryam�۪s deceased son is learned to have frequented a mosque attended by a radical Muslim and becomes the bombing�۪s prime suspect hostility and defensiveness swiftly eradicate the women�۪s mutual empathy." the director Jeremiah Birnbaum keeps the emotions convincingly intense if largely internalized forcing the actors to express themselves in small profoundly human gestures. Fathers ��� one Muslim one evangelical Christian ��� hover helplessly on the margins each having paid a price for his religious beliefs." Michael Richter�۪s screenplay lays bare the damage wrought by Sept. 11 while deftly dodging hysteria wondering how we differentiate between innocent teenage behaviors and dangerous red flags. Most of all it wonders if we can ever fully know the people we live with leaving the question to resonate as deeply as the two women�۪s grief."

As a translator and speechwriter he still at 84 seems honored to have had a perch so close to the pioneers of the subtitle: Golda Meir Yitzhak Rabin Levi Eshkol and Menachem Begin. But it is jarring to hear actors like Sandra Bullock (as Meir) and Leonard Nimoy (as Eshkol) give voice to these figures in letters and speeches because the film includes clips of the politicians in their own voices." a division of the Simon Wiesenthal Center is nearly two hours long. (The second part is due early next year.) A bit overstuffed with history and tales of perseverance the film doesn�۪t have room for balanced political analysis or even exposition at times.

Not the actual Assange of course but the actor Benedict Cumberbatch with platinum locks and an Aussie accent providing an uncanny simulacrum. Asked what he thinks of ���the WikiLeaks movie �۝ Assange snorts that it�۪s more like ���the anti-WikiLeaks movie �۝ bashes the books it�۪s based on and casts imperious doubt on its accuracy." the real Mr. Assange has not been shy about sharing his feelings publishing an open letter to Mr. Cumberbatch on the WikiLeaks site and describing ���The Fifth Estate�۝ in an e-mail to a New York Times reporter as ���a reactionary snoozefest that only the U.S. government could love.�۝ As of this writing the government has not weighed in but it seems to me that Mr. Assange�۪s judgment is only half right. This version of the WikiLeaks story directed by Bill Condon from a script by Josh Singer is a moderate snoozefest undone by its timid muddled efforts at fair-mindedness." who has published hundreds of thousands of classified documents exposing the secrets of governments banks and other powerful institutions is a figure who inspires strong feelings including ambivalence. The intense devotion of some of his admirers can seem like yet another digital cult of personality while the disdain and condescension of critics often looks defensive and clueless. ���The Fifth Estate�۝ tries to have it both ways to harness the righteous transgressive thrill of the WikiLeaks project and also to wag a cautionary finger when it appears to go too far." flashing back from a pivotal moment in 2010 when Assange and his colleagues are preparing to publish a huge cache of diplomatic cables traces an arc from admiration to disillusionment. It charts the relationship between Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Br�_hl) a German hacker who joined WikiLeaks in 2007 and later wrote one of the books that Mr. Condon and Mr. Singer drew upon.

But the geopolitics and the news-breaking are tangled up in too much psychodrama and the movie loses its focus and energy as subplots and tangential themes proliferate.

Mr. Condon builds an open-air newsroom in the sky where virtual selves collaborate invisible to one another and out of reach of the rest of the world.

After giving the infant nestled between her legs a quick look she pulls out an alarmingly oversized pair of scissors and whoosh goes for the kill. But something stops her (divine or narrative intervention) and instead she embraces Baby Carrie a child to hold protect mother and smother until death do them part." Ms. Moretz has taken over the title role and Carrie has set off down her dreadful path. Margaret as the opener suggests is a religious fanatic of ambiguous denomination who has an unpleasant habit of mortifying her own flesh by say gouging her pale thighs with sharp unsubtly phallic objects. Fearful of the fallen world or rather its effect on her too mortal flesh she keeps Carrie on a tight leash and in modest clothing. A seeming prisoner of her mother�۪s madness Carrie finds no refuge at school where the other girls taunt her including in the shower where after she gets her period for the first time she�۪s pelted with tampons and chants of ���plug it up�۝ by the likes of Chris (Portia Doubleday) and Sue (Gabriella Wilde)." blood runs through ���Carrie �۝ first as a symbolically suggestive trickle ��� initially as an unholy brew of menstruation and the blood of Christ ��� and then in great gushing waves as the body count mounts. Ms. Peirce plays up the story�۪s religious themes and Carrie�۪s burgeoning power as she discovers her telekinetic gifts even as the dread of the female body that deepens Mr. De Palma�۪s version somehow goes missing. This ���Carrie�۝ has its share of terrors certainly partly because of the seeming timelessness of its deeper more resonant themes.

Yet there are times when their concern feels less about Idris and more about them as in an early scene when Ms. Stephenson talks about a letter from Dalton inviting Idris to participate in a tutoring program.

But though Allen may be the film�۪s protagonist in his own eyes and those of his peers he is more sidekick than hero: the boy who watches and wonders while more reckless and charismatic friends claim center stage." heir to his family�۪s adding-machine estate and a Harvard man is a natty dresser with detached almost scholarly interests in pornography and drugs that will blossom eventually into ���Naked Lunch.�۝ Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) is a randy restless ex-jock with a live-in girlfriend (Elizabeth Olsen) whom he cheats on fights with and takes for granted. (If you are looking for critical perspective on the misogyny of postwar America�۪s most famous literary radicals you will not find it here.)" who tries to push past the established contours of his character�۪s public persona Mr. Foster and Mr. Huston are content with celebrity impersonation.

We are allowed a peek at the genesis of a movement that would become a matter of cultural controversy and eventually academic study. It is mildly thrilling to watch Allen spar with his English professor (John Cullum) about rhyme and meter. You feel a vicarious revolutionary frisson even if the arguments sound a bit simplistic. (The professor not a complete square presciently refers to his renegade student as ���Whitman Junior.�۝) And Mr. Krokidas deftly shows how the ambition to write is entangled with other impulses. The emergence of Allen�۪s poetic vocation is almost a subplot in a story about guilt lust friendship and murder." or even primarily Allen�۪s. The center of his antisocial social universe is less Burroughs or Kerouac than Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) an epicene preppy who dazzles Allen with his casual erudition and his systematic contempt for rules. Lu (as he is known) is a prankster a provocateur and something of a muse. He lends Allen his copy of ���A Vision �۝ by William Butler Yeats and urges his new friend to compose a manifesto that will go even further than Yeats�۪s Ouija board mysticism." Lu is a troubled young man struggling with his sexuality his schoolwork and his attachment to David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall) an older man who is both mentor and predator to him. David a former teacher of Lucien�۪s writes his college assignments in exchange for sex and hosts Bohemian parties where he shows off his young prot̩g̩. When Lu tries to pull away David becomes increasingly desperate and possessive and their relationship veers from creepy and sad to violent and tragic." a secret episode in the lives of Ginsberg Burroughs and Kerouac. (Lucien Carr later broke with the group and demanded that Ginsberg remove his name from the dedication of ���Howl and Other Poems.�۝) Telling it now posthumously involves not only the recovery of lost biographical information but also the reimagining of a chapter in recent gay history." affirming Allen�۪s erotic self-discovery even as it explores the shadows of the closet where he and his friends must dwell. The idea that poetry can give expression to hidden dangerous truths is given a specific content that explains some of the intensity of their commitment to it. The freedom to abandon rhyme and polite diction becomes the vehicle and symbol for other kinds of freedom. Lucien�۪s mantra ���First thought best thought�۝ (which is the opposite of the writerly wisdom evoked in the film�۪s title) is an argument against repression in all its forms even though Lucien himself cannot quite live by it." what he became and how the world changed around him. But in 1944 all of that was far from self-evident and the risks were enormous and terrifying. The achievement of ���Kill Your Darlings�۝ is to give a modern audience a taste of that terror and also of the thrill and intoxication that went along with it." with foul mouths and unruly appetites."

two models of American virility had similarities not least as outdoorsmen: Cooper grew up on a farm in Montana and Hemingway was a big-game hunter and deep-sea fisherman. But they were also a study in contrasts: Cooper worked with movie crews; Hemingway labored alone. Cooper was understated and conservative Hemingway volatile and a liberal. The mix as John Mulholland�۪s exhaustive documentary ���Cooper & Hemingway: The True Gen�۝ demonstrates made for a friendship spanning decades." which dovetailed with Hemingway�۪s less-is-more writing philosophy. Cooper had starred in Hollywood�۪s adaptation of Hemingway�۪s ���Farewell to Arms�۝ (1932) before the men first met in Idaho in 1940. Hemingway later insisted that Cooper be cast in ���For Whom the Bell Tolls�۝ (1943). After a critical and commercial decline each rebounded in 1952 Cooper with ���High Noon�۝ (for which he won his second Oscar) and Hemingway with ���The Old Man and the Sea�۝ (and two years later his Nobel Prize).

�۝ a movie that insistently closes the distance between us and them has a vital moral immediacy. It was directed by Paul Greengrass the British filmmaker who quickened the pulse of contemporary action cinema with the second and third installments in the Bourne franchise features that proved yet again that big-screen thrills and thought need not be mutually exclusive. Kinetic action and intelligence are similarly the driving forces in ���Captain Phillips �۝ which like Mr. Greengrass�۪s Bourne movies shakes you up first with its style and then with its ideas." true events that unfolded in early April 2009 when four armed Somalis seized the Maersk Alabama an American container ship under the command of Richard Phillips. The ship with an unarmed crew of just 20 sailors was hauling tons of cargo in hundreds of containers including food from the United Nations World Food Program designated for African countries. To the Somalis the ship apparently looked like a floating jackpot. What happened next played out in world news and Captain Phillips went on to write with Stephan Talty a plodding straightforward book with the telegraphing title ���A Captain�۪s Duty: Somali Pirates Navy SEALS and Dangerous Days at Sea.�۝" �۝ and while they trace a similar narrative arc and share numerous details they�۪re worlds apart in terms of sensibility. Written by Billy Ray (whose credits include ���Shattered Glass�۝) it opens with a postcard-perfect shot of a white Vermont house. Inside Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) is packing up and checking his route. He and his wife a nurse Andrea (Catherine Keener who�۪s there to underscore Phillips�۪s decency) are soon on their way to the airport and murmuring about their children the future and a fast scarily changing world. There�۪s a stiltedness to their talk ��� and Mr. Hanks leads too hard with a broad Boston accent ��� yet the scene�۪s intimacy and the couple�۪s vulnerabilities immediately humanize Phillips." testing its unlocked security gates and running his crew through a safety drill. Almost as soon as the crew finishes the exercise it�۪s confronted with a real-world threat: two rapidly approaching skiffs. Phillips and the crew dodge the skiffs by increasing their speed (the real ship�۪s speed topped out at 18 knots or about 21 miles per hour) and shifting course to churn up destabilizing waves. Badly rocked their jerry-built engines sputtering the skiffs turn back but the next day one returns with four heavily armed Somali men. Led by Muse (the newcomer Barkhad Abdi very very fine) the Somalis board the Alabama initiating a harrowing siege." a lot of the news reports focused on Captain Phillips and the nominal exoticism of a 21st-century piracy that had nothing to do with illegal downloads football or Johnny Depp swashbuckling through a Disney franchise. The existential realities that inform contemporary Somali piracy turn out to be one of the unexpected themes of ���Captain Phillips �۝ which begins as something of a procedural about men at work and morphs into a jittery thriller even as it also deepens brilliantly unexpectedly into an unsettling look at global capitalism and American privilege and power. Phillips is unambiguously a heroic figure but he�۪s scarcely the sole point of interest in a movie that steadily and almost stealthily asserts the agonized humanity of his captors." however corrupted. But that even as the movie�۪s rhythms quicken along with your own ��� Mr. Greengrass works you over like a deep-tissue pugilist with smash cuts racing cameras and a propulsive soundtrack so you feel the urgency as well as see it ��� an argument is being created. There is you realize meaning here beyond the plot meaning in the barren Somali hamlet in which Muse and his companions congregate under warlord gunpoint and in the razored angles of their startling gaunt faces. There�۪s meaning too in the wild eyes and stained teeth of men who never eat but stuff their thin cheeks with khat the amphetaminelike plant that among its uses helps suppress the appetite." the action downshifts and the story settles uneasily into a tense standoff with Muse and Phillips now staring warily at each other across the ship�۪s bridge rather than across the water through binoculars. Mr. Hanks is one of the few movie stars who like Gary Cooper once upon a Hollywood time can convey a sense of old-fashioned American decency just by standing in the frame. There�۪s something so unforced about him that it can seem as if he�۪s not delivering a performance just being Tom Hanks. This feeling of authenticity however well honed and movie made dovetails with Phillips�۪s gruff likability to create a portrait of a man trying to keep himself his crew and his ship together even as the world he knew comes violently undone." which descends with expected might in warships that loom over the crisis like idled waiting giants. Throughout ���Captain Phillips �۝ Mr. Greengrass plays with scale proportion and camera angles to underscore the differences at play in the story; there�۪s an early aerial shot of Phillips walking on the deck of the Alabama and dwarfed by a ship that in turn drifts like a speck on the water. Later these extremes accentuate the paradoxes of the story ��� the tiny Somalis scrambling aboard an enormous American ship ��� that grow more pointed and political as when a group of hugely muscled Navy personnel arrive and begin gearing up for a finale in which there seem to be many Goliaths but no David." even if ���Captain Phillips �۝ which revs you up with frenzied action and violent spectacle does surprise by denying you the usual action-movie high. Because just as the movie races toward its foregone conclusion it also begins siphoning off the excitement it has been building up all along. The big men with the big guns do their part but the skin-prickling carnal excitement that almost inevitably comes with certain types of screen violence never manifests replaced instead by dread anxiety a shaking man and whole a lot of blood. It�۪s the kind of blood that most movies avoid and that Mr. Greengrass suggests is what remains unseen in global traumas like this. Some viewers may pump their fists but I think he wants this victory to shatter you." bloody action and adult language."

Fanning all of Scott�۪s insecurities Miles is the perfect nemesis and as Scott�۪s life gradually dismantles the directors Katie Graham and Andrew Matthews indulge his reprehensible behavior.

�۝ published in 1930 is about a family hauling the dead body of one of its members on a journey of several days over rough terrain in a mule-drawn cart. That might be one definition of a fool�۪s errand the primary fool being Anse Bundren a stubborn suspicious and toothless Mississippi farmer who insists on burying his wife Addie in her hometown. Another definition might be the attempt to turn Faulkner�۪s splintered lyrical book into a movie. In this case the fool would be James Franco who directed and stars in the first film adaptation of a book that has long been considered unfilmable." Mr. Franco has accomplished something serious and worthwhile. His ���As I Lay Dying�۝ is certainly ambitious but it is also admirably modest. The script written by Mr. Franco with Matt Rager tries to pare Faulkner�۪s multivoiced narrative to a manageable essence. The book is a series of fragmented monologues spoken by Addie her friends and kin and people her burial party encounters on its journey. (The shortest chapter is a single sentence uttered by Anse and Addie�۪s youngest son Vardaman: ���My mother is a fish.�۝) Some of these are pared away some shoehorned into dialogue and others rendered in voice-over. The frequent use of a split screen ��� sometimes effective sometimes distracting ��� emphasizes the isolation of the characters even as they are connected by blood duty and desire." three of whom are also his. In addition to Vardaman (Brady Permenter) there is Cash (Jim Parrack) a skilled carpenter who built the coffin; Darl (Mr. Franco) who is sensitive perhaps to the point of mental illness; Dewey Dell (Ahna O�۪Reilly) secretly pregnant; and Jewel (Logan Marshall-Green) the offspring of Addie�۪s affair with the local preacher. All of them are assembled in the service of Anse�۪s determination to honor his wife�۪s wishes about her final resting place." he is a complicated fellow an odd blend of ridiculousness and nobility played by Tim Blake Nelson with sharp eyes and a slack jaw. Mr. Nelson has the most strenuous job of acting since Anse is the biggest talker in the family but it is Beth Grant as Addie a dead woman staring straight into the camera and speaking her mind who registers the strongest impression. Ms. O�۪Reilly is anxious and watchful while Mr. Parrack captures Cash�۪s stoicism and Mr. Marshall-Green Jewel�۪s hotheadedness. Mr. Franco as the most inwardly troubled and alert of the siblings coasts a little on the assumed sympathy of the audience. Either that or his movie-star magnetism gets in the way of his efforts and diffidence but at any rate his Darl is blurrier than the rest." though ���As I Lay Dying�۝ conveys some of Faulkner�۪s themes and the details of the Bundren family story with clarity and concision. All the children pay a terrible price as they obey their father and honor their mother and their composite story is a catalog of material and moral losses. A foot a horse freedom dignity and innocence are among the sacrifices. And while the Bundrens are poor country people there is something almost Greek about their fates as if they were a House of Atreus transplanted to a cabin in the Yoknapatawpha backwoods." but he at least makes you aware of it. His tour as actor and filmmaker through some of the thickets of 20th-century American history ��� he has recently tackled Allen Ginsberg Hart Crane and Cormac McCarthy in addition to Faulkner ��� has been worth following not least because he makes his enthusiasm for these writers contagious." death and a grisly scene of amputation."

In public Mister leads with his chin but when you first see him his head is down and tears have splashed on the failing grade that will force him to repeat eighth grade. His teacher shoots Mister a withering look and then gives him a ride. It�۪s unpleasant but it�۪s for your own good the teacher says a finger wagging that Mister a proud stubborn child answers with a burn-it-down expletive." sad kid in one funny sad movie. Pitched fascinatingly at times uneasily between misery and uplift ���Mister & Pete�۝ tells the story of an endlessly resourceful child who survives the unimaginable over one long summer. The trouble begins when Mister�۪s mother Gloria (Jennifer Hudson) ��� who�۪s hit the bad mother trifecta: she�۪s a prostitute heroin addict and welfare recipient ��� is arrested leaving him on his own with Pete a 9-year-old neighborhood stray. The cupboard is as empty as Gloria�۪s electronic benefit card. But in the hands of the director George Tillman Jr. who lightens the mood with jazz comic moments and warm colors Mister and Pete�۪s situation doesn�۪t seem too awful at least at first. And poor kids do the darnedest things like committing larceny." Mister and Pete elude a menacing cop Pike (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and struggle to keep cool and entertained. They also try to keep fed an endeavor that initially registers as a challenge rather than a calamity. Part of this is because of Mister who it becomes clear has been working the angles all his life. He schemes before he weeps. Mr. Tillman�۪s style which owes a debt to the theatrical style of Spike Lee�۪s ���Do the Right Thing�۝ and similarly transforms the projects into a stage also softens the hard times as do the cuter lines and some of the turns in Michael Starrbury�۪s script." which helps explain its narrow vision of the world. Even so there are moments when that child�۪s view melts away particularly in the portrayal of Gloria who comes perilously close to an ugly stereotype about single African-American mothers. Ms. Hudson�۪s natural likability helps humanize the character even when after sliding the needle in and drifting into a haze Gloria waves her hand at Mister.

or does evil stalk the happiest place on earth?" and ���Escape From Tomorrow �۝ directed by Randy Moore conjures at least for a while a convincing mood of disorientation and dread. Shooting surreptitiously in actual Disney theme parks and resorts Mr. Moore uses off-kilter camera angles and spooky black-and-white cinematography to draw out the creepiness lurking behind the family-friendly fun. The movie is based on the sturdy Freudian notion of the return of the repressed. It imagines that everything the Disney brand proudly excludes ��� sex bloodshed boredom rage ��� is never very far away." which huffs and puffs and flails simultaneously going over the top and running out of steam. As Jim stumbles through a day at the park ��� bickering with his wife trailing after the kids leering at two French teenage girls ��� suspense dissipates and subtle horror movie touches give way to flights of literal-minded surrealism. None of it is as scary or as funny as it should be and what starts out as a sly thumb in the eye of corporate power ends up as a muddled and amateurish homage to David Lynch."

�۝ a riveting documentary about a disastrous moment in mountain-climbing history doesn�۪t spend much time trying to explain why anyone would tackle a climb that kills a quarter of the people who attempt it. It�۪s a smart omission on the part of the director Nick Ryan. Whenever extreme athletes and adventurers try to convey why they pursue high-risk activities they end up spouting the kind of not-very-illuminating clich̩s that would have only bogged this movie down." ���The Summit�۝ simply accepts the age-old truth that if there is a mountain on the planet someone will try to reach the top of it. That lets it insert you into the slowly unfolding disaster that took place in early August 2008 as several groups of climbers representing various nationalities tried to ascend K2 the world�۪s second-highest mountain. Eleven died." drawing on interviews with survivors and on footage that was shot by several participants during the climb pieces together what apparently happened a terrifying tale of falling ice a shortage of rope confusion and heroism.

�۝ but before long it is contradicted or at least complicated. As our eyes (from behind 3-D glasses) adjust to the vast darkness illuminated by streaks of sunlight refracted through the Earth�۪s atmosphere we detect movement that is recognizably human and hear familiar voices. Those tiny figures bouncing around on that floating contraption ��� it looks like a mobile suspended from a child�۪s bedroom ceiling ��� are people. Scientists. Astronauts. Movie stars. (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in spacesuits as Mission Specialist Ryan Stone and Mission Commander Matt Kowalski; Ed Harris unseen and unnamed as ���Houston�۝ down below)." Alfonso Cuar�_n (who wrote the script with his son Jon��s) is not visualizing the unimaginable so much as overcoming the audience�۪s assumption that we�۪ve seen it all before. After more than 50 years space travel has lost some of its luster and movies are partly to blame for our jadedness. It has been a long time since a filmmaker conjured the awe of ���2001: A Space Odyssey�۝ or the terror of ���Alien�۝ or captured afresh the spooky wonder of a trip outside our native atmosphere." no pompous flights of allegory no extravagant pseudo-epic gestures. Instead there is a swift and buoyant story of the struggle for survival in terrible rapidly changing circumstances. Cosmic questions about our place in the universe are not so much avoided as subordinated to more pressing practical concerns. How do you outrun a storm of debris? Launch a landing module without fuel? Decipher an instruction manual in Russian or Chinese?" I was relieved to learn that a fire extinguisher really can serve as a makeshift zero-G jetpack. Not a spoiler just a word to the wise.) Surely though the standard for a movie like this one is not realism but coherence. Every true outlaw has a code. The laws of physics are no exception and Mr. Cuar�_n violates them with ingenious and exuberant rigor." what�۪s worse sends a blizzard of shrapnel hurtling toward the astronauts. Quite a bit goes wrong. Straps connecting astronauts to the relative security of their spacecraft are severed. Parachute lines foul engines. Fires break out inside vessels and stuff outside is smashed to pieces. Not everyone survives. All of it ��� terrifyingly and marvelously ��� evades summary and confounds expectations. You have to see it to believe it." cloud-swept face of home. The perspective is dazzling and jarring and Mr. Cuar�_n allows a few moments of quiet contemplative beauty to punctuate the busy desperate activity of staying alive. Kowalski generally an irreverent joker pauses to savor the sun over the Ganges and you may find yourself picking out other geographical details. Look there�۪s Italy and the Nile Valley. These reference points are as unsettling as they are reassuring because they are glimpsed from a vantage point that is newly and profoundly alien." which surpasses even what James Cameron accomplished in the flight sequences of ���Avatar.�۝ More than that film (and more than ���Hugo�۝ or ���How to Train Your Dragon�۝ or any other high-quality recent specimens) ���Gravity�۝ treats 3-D as essential to the information it wants to share. The reason for that is summed up in the title which names an obvious missing element. Nothing in the movie ��� not hand tools or chess pieces human bodies or cruise-ship-size space stations ��� rests within a stable vertical or horizontal plane. Neither does the movie itself which in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them." come to think of it. The script is at times weighed down by some heavy screenwriting clich̩s. Some are minor like the fuel gauge that reads full until the glass is tapped causing the arrow to drop. More cringe-inducing is the tragic back story stapled to Stone a doctor on her first trip into orbit. We would care about her even without the haunting memory of a dead child who inspires a maudlin monologue and a flight of orchestral bathos in Steven Price�۪s otherwise canny and haunting score." �۝ I found its talkiness annoying. Not just Ms. Bullock�۪s perky-anxious soliloquizing but also Mr. Clooney�۪s gruff regular-guy wisecracking. Doesn�۪t Stone say her favorite thing about space is the silence?" to themselves and each other and to Houston ���in the blind �۝ partly to keep the terror of their situation at bay to fight the overwhelming sense of how tiny and insignificant they are in the cosmos." for that very reason affecting. For all of Mr. Cuar�_n�۪s formal wizardry and pictorial grandeur he is a humanist at heart.

���A Touch of Sin�۝ is at once monumental and human scale. A story of lives rocked by violence it has the urgency of a screaming headline but one inscribed with visual lyricism emotional weight and a belief in individual rights. You can feel the conviction of its director Jia Zhang-ke ��� one of the few filmmakers of any nationality who weighs the impact of social and political shifts on people ��� in every shot. In ���A Touch of Sin �۝ the world isn�۪t an amorphous backdrop pretty scenery for private dramas it is a stage on which men and women struggle to fulfill basic moral obligations including recognizing one another�۪s humanity." each centered on a different character the movie opens near a northern town where a man in a green army coat Dahai (an imposing Jiang Wu) has started a solitary campaign against the village chief and the local boss who have grown rich selling collective property. Most of the villagers turn away from Dahai and his protests laughing and grimacing by turns seemingly resigned to what some might be called fate. Mr. Jia however is interested in forces beyond the providential. What concerns him are people who caught in the jaws of historical change are battered exploited and dehumanized by others who now value only things like the private plane that the big boss buys and the Maserati that he parks unlocked in front of his factory." these luxury items are in striking contrast to the village�۪s forlorn statue of Mao (representative of a fading belief system) and its Buddhist temple (symbol of yet older beliefs) at which Dahai takes a brutal lonely stand. Yet while he is very much a man alone his presence fight against corruption and convictions rise like ghosts later in the movie when prostitutes working in a luxurious nightclub march out in Vegas-style versions of Red Army uniforms that are perverse mockeries of Dahai�۪s humble coat. In some movies such connecting moments can be quasi-mystical and sentimental (we are the world) and tend to gut whatever political point hovers in the vicinity. Here the characters are connected by their existential reality of being alive in contemporary China." who rides into the movie on a motorcycle wearing black and a Chicago Bulls watch cap. He�۪s returning to his home in Chongqing a huge southwestern city on the upper Yangtze River that�۪s set against the scarred beauty of the mountainous Three Gorges region now the site of the largest hydroelectric project in the world. Here high-rises pierce the hazy sky and peasants grow vegetables on riverbanks. No one seems happy to see Zhou San who pinches his son�۪s cheeks until the boy cries. His wife looks away; his mother looks through him. There�۪s menace in his every gesture but what they can�۪t know is that he has recently gunned down three men in what feels like a Hobbesian war of all against all." Mr. Jia seems to be saying is happening right here right now. The eruptions of violence some of it bloody add to the intensity as do other filmmaking choices. Mr. Jia has long blurred the line between fiction and nonfiction through his use of digital cinematography which helps convey a sense of documentarylike immediacy and through real locations and nonprofessional performers working alongside trained actors. In his movies characters feel as if they live in a world that�۪s so rapidly changing so unsettled and destabilizing that it seems the very ground under them is collapsing along with innumerable social political and aesthetic frameworks." Xiao Yu a sauna receptionist played by Zhao Tao Mr. Jia�۪s wife and frequent star. A dreamy rootless character Xiao Yu wears her long hair in a ponytail that brings to mind that of the heroine in King Hu�۪s classic martial arts film ���A Touch of Zen�۝ ��� a touchstone here for Mr. Jia ��� and is having an affair with a married man. Her story opens soon before she gives her lover an ultimatum; in return he gives her a knife that will find its mark. Later she unknowingly follows the same footsteps as the character in the final section a young man Xiao Hui (Luo Lanshan a delicate sweet-faced newcomer) who�۪s spiraling into debt and despair." momentarily loosening the realism. When Dahai picks up a shotgun in the first section there�۪s a pan to the image of a tiger and you hear a roar as if Dahai were possessed by the animal one of the 12 in the Chinese Zodiac. In the third section Xiao Yu is beaten and takes shelter in a surrealistic sideshow in which ���holy snakes�۝ slither around a young woman�۪s feet. But after Xiao Yu is beaten a second time she too seems transformed and assumes the stance of a martial-arts warrior striking exaggerated poses with a raised knife amid the now-Expressionistic light and shadow." working with his brilliant cinematographer Yu Likwai finds in cities villages and along highways. At the same time the transformation of these characters into archetypes like Mr. Jia�۪s references to Chinese opera implies there are other stories forms and beliefs that China can embrace beyond those represented either by a Mao statue or a private plane. Time is running out as suggested late in the movie when a young man and woman slip some live goldfish into a stream enacting a Buddhist ritual in which captive animals are released to encourage compassion. The animals of course need to be trapped so they can be freed a dreadful paradox that these two imprisoned people will never experience."

�۝ Christine Yoo�۪s feature directing debut is swimming in color clich̩s and stereotypes recalling Baz Luhrmann�۪s ���Strictly Ballroom�۝ and other films of that highly stylized ilk. While the story is a bit weak the film does a good job of contrasting Korean-Americans who steadfastly adhere to the traditions of their homeland with South Koreans who have renounced old customs." Jason (Brian Tee) experiences a familial love that is just as complicated as the romantic kind. When his fianc̩e ditches him his high-strung mother is the one who is ready to jump off a cliff. But there is some justification: A family curse could bring about his death if he doesn�۪t marry by his fast-approaching 30th birthday. When he travels to Seoul for work he finds love on his own terms ��� with a South Korean businesswoman Na Young (Hye-jung Kang) who laments that Korean-Americans are ���stuck in the �۪70s.�۝ Their bliss doesn�۪t last however; in the United States hysterics ensue when a revelation about Na Young comes to light." some clever animation and a few chuckles. (The script was written by Ms. Yoo and Robert Gardner.) And the expert cast keeps the film on track: Mr. Tee (���The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift�۝) and Ms. Kang (���Oldboy�۝) sparkle together; Bobby Lee hilariously extols the joys of marriage; Margaret Cho is a shaman who loves mojitos; and Stephen Park as Jason�۪s exasperated father has perfect deadpan delivery."

�۝ Ariana Delawari documents her father�۪s role in helping his home country Afghanistan modernize its financial system after the fall of the Taliban. But this intimate film Ms. Delawari�۪s first is about so much more: her family�۪s history (seen in home movies and photographs) the resilience of the Afghan people and her own story of self-discovery as a musician." refugees bands and dancers caught her curious eye during visits to Afghanistan and we see those images here. (Ms. Delawari�۪s father Noorullah and mother Setara moved there from Los Angeles in 2002.) Her personal mission soon became clear: She would make an album enlisting her American bandmates and Afghan musicians. The achingly beautiful soul-filled music that they create recorded in Dari and English in the Delawari home in Kabul transcends language. The collaboration is (nearly) effortless and the scenes of them performing together are magical. A dozen years ago the Afghan men would have been hanged for breaking Taliban decrees against music by playing instruments like the dilruba or tabla." ���Lion of Panjshir �۝ in The New York Times in 2009 Jon Caramanica said ���The best songs on this impressive album are those that blend Ms. Delawari�۪s two locales.�۝ He called ���Be Gone Taliban�۝ ���a ferocious and visceral piece of agit-pop.�۝Fortunately Ms. Delawari now 32 has inherited her father�۪s passion for activism: He�۪s helping to shape Afghanistan�۪s financial future and she�۪s one of the country�۪s cultural ambassadors."

From there she began a push to ban declawing of domestic cats a campaign that became national news in 2003 when West Hollywood Calif. outlawed the procedure." and opponents of declawing use words like amputation and mutilation to describe the procedure. But Ms. Conrad does a good job of not letting experts who support her cause get carried away allowing images of limping animals to convey the emotional part of her argument. The film eventually becomes bogged down in the fallout from the West Hollywood ordinance which now feels like ancient history but it certainly will make any cat owner and perhaps some fellow veterinarians think twice about declawing."

Just as television news in the United States involved training and laying groundwork in the mid-20th century so does this station require teams of producers here much aided by experienced expatriates (from Australia for example) who navigate culture clashes. Ms. Orner�۪s often rough-looking film slips into anecdotal reactions and lacks a clear spatial sense for the company�۪s layout but we do see clips from its stable of standard genre shows." �۝ previously covered in Havana Marking�۪s 2009 documentary of the same name; Jehane Noujaim�۪s ���Control Room�۝ (2004) also comes to mind. ���The Network�۝ feels biased toward Afghanistan�۪s elite who left then returned and wedded to the perspective of the station�۪s personnel.

Rather than through a harangue or a lament Mr. Reich ties together his talking points with a reasonable-sounding analysis and an unassuming warmth sometimes absent from documentaries charting America�۪s economic woes." but ���Inequality for All�۝ is still the kind of movie that mostly amounts to a segmented lecture illustrated with interviews and color-coded graphics. Mr. Kornbluth�۪s film is framed by (and dotted with) excerpts from a class Mr. Reich teaches at the University of California Berkeley where he is a professor. Offsetting the macro with some micro are poignant quotes from middle-class wage-earners of varying political stripes as well as the perspective of a multimillionaire who (comfortably) denounces the effects of income inequality." which is never quite delineated here) is bad for a consumer-based economy.

But if you want to learn how the area near the small Alabama city of Muscle Shoals which hugs the south bank of the Tennessee River became a renowned music center ��� the place where Percy Sledge�۪s Civil Rights-era chartbuster ���When a Man Loves a Woman�۝ was born and where Aretha Franklin poured sweat and tears into ���I Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You)�۝ ��� then you will need to look and listen elsewhere." the movie charts the area�۪s music industry and what is lyrically if elusively called the Muscle Shoals sound. It�۪s a history that the documentary�۪s first-time director Greg Camalier introduces with an American Indian myth about a woman singing in what became known as the Tennessee River and that native peoples called the Singing River. It�۪s a poetic starting point one that Mr. Camalier repeatedly evokes with many many beauty shots of the rushing river even as he turns to more recent times and the likes of a local boy made good named Rick Hall." Mr. Hall created Fame publishing in 1959 with two others and went on to record hits by the likes of Mr. Sledge and Clarence Carter who both tell a few stories on camera. Mr. Hall is a diverting if overly dominant presence in the documentary which includes testimonials from members of his former house band the Swampers who went on to establish the Muscle Shoals Sound Studios. It was the Swampers who helped keep the beat on Ms. Franklin�۪s ���I Never Loved a Man�۝ and it was at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio that the Rolling Stones ���  Mick Jagger and Keith Richards pop up in separate interviews ��� recorded ���Brown Sugar�۝ in 1969." another Muscle Shoals client.

Publicists at the press screening were handing out earplugs along with 3-D glasses but I kept mine in my pocket for the authentic headbanging experience." frankly not quite as intense as it might have been. Metallica which alchemizes amorphous adolescent discontent into grandiose technically dazzling nuggets of sound is best experienced in the ecstatic collectivity of a concert or the throbbing privacy of your own head. Despite swooping camera movements and elaborate stagecraft the film produces detachment rather than immediacy. And a too-literal subplot about a young roadie (Dane DeHaan) on a mysterious quest through the streets of a riot-torn city is even more alienating. It has the clumsy earnest feel of fan fiction or even parody. On the other hand ���Enter Sandman�۝ is still a great song and the band kills it."

And while addiction may make Jon sound like a bummer as played with great swagger and subterranean wit by the movie�۪s writer and director Joseph Gordon-Levitt this improbable charmer conveys convincingly triumphant braggadocio. That�۪s true even if all Jon cares about as he repeatedly claims in a voice-over that sounds like a loop are ������my body my pad my ride my family my church my boys my girls my porn.�۝ That�۪s a whole lot of me and mine." making a fine feature directing debut shapes into a story about a young man�۪s moral education.

After he and his friends the diminutive sounding Bobby and Danny (Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke) debate her beauty using their usual crude methodology ��� Jon deems her a dime or a 10 ��� he makes his well-practiced move. What he fails to grasp is that the moment he locks eyes with Barbara he�۪s no longer the hunter but the prey." specifically to the kind of storybook romance that the movie suggests reduces human relations to commercial transactions as much as pornography does. Mr. Gordon-Levitt has fun with this idea (and with cameos from Anne Hathaway and Channing Tatum) without fully developing it. ���Don Jon�۝ takes women seriously but like a lot of contemporary American movies including many romantic comedies it�۪s mostly interested in what it means to be a feeling thinking man in a world in which many of the old certainties have disappeared. Each time Jon sits down to a family dinner ��� his mother (Glenne Headly) bustling in the kitchen as his father (Tony Danza) waits at the table ��� the comedy feels almost ethnographic as if you were watching a soon-to-be-extinct tribe." Mr. Gordon-Levitt almost smothers his intelligent movie in jokes as with the repeated references to Jon�۪s pad his ride his girls and boys all of which register fairly soon as markers or even trophies of an obsessively cultivated narcissism. With his pumped physique and shellacked hair his tight pants and hard jaw Jon is as much a walking talking cartoon as the representations he onanistically worships so it�۪s fitting that the movie opens with an actual animation. It�۪s the first in a flurry of equally cartoonish images now of real women which flash across the screen and as the pace of the editing accelerates turn into a flurry of pneumatic breasts bulbous buttocks and cavernous mouths. It�۪s a kind of dismemberment by montage although here it�۪s finally Jon who�۪s in pieces." ���Don Jon�۝ echoes an idea that the film theorist Linda Williams advances toward the end of ���Hard Core: Power Pleasure and the ���Frenzy of the Visible �۪�ʉ۝ her revolutionary feminist study of pornographic films and their contradictions. ���Pornography as a genre wants to be about sex �۝ Ms. Williams writes. ���On close inspection however it always proves to be more about gender.�۝ Mr. Gordon-Levitt effectively translates that thesis into funny eventually touching and dramatic terms in his movie which shifts registers when Jon meets an almost ghostly older woman Esther (a tender true Julianne Moore).

It would be wrong to say that Mr. Dark never achieved fame because he makes it very clear that he never sought it. He works at a supermarket spends time with his dogs and has settled into a solitary and self-sufficient existence." when Mr. Shepard was a rising star of experimental theater. Mr. Dark married Scarlett Johnson whose daughter O-Lan married Mr. Shepard. The two couples lived together for most of the 1970s in the San Francisco area along with Scarlett�۪s other daughter and Sam and O-Lan�۪s son Jesse Mr. Dark�۪s stepgrandson. When Scarlett suffered a severe brain hemorrhage Mr. Shepard helped her and her husband through a grueling and incomplete convalescence and when Mr. Shepard moved out to pursue his relationship with Jessica Lange Mr. Dark was there to provide emotional support for Jesse and O-Lan." they wrote letters full of loose-limbed philosophizing emotional candor and gruff wit. Those letters which fill cartons and binders provide the movie with its premise. Mr. Shepard shortly after splitting with Ms. Lange decided to sell them to a library in Texas and prepare a volume for publication along with some of Mr. Dark�۪s photographs." and the easy rapport between the old pals starts to fray as temperamental differences and asymmetries of status pull them apart. Friendship is almost always built on competition as well as solidarity and respect can be a mask for envy. Mr. Shepard restless and ambitious takes for granted some of the privileges of fame but also looks wistfully at Mr. Dark�۪s steadfastness and contentment. Mr. Dark at one point complains about feeling like Mr. Shepard�۪s ���sidekick �۝ but at times in ���Shepard & Dark�۝ it seems as if the reverse is true as if the plain-spoken pot-smoking deli clerk possesses greater charisma and deeper wisdom than the eminent writer." who knows? The film points toward a rich and complicated story that only partly makes it onto the screen.

�۝ Ron Howard�۪s excitingly torqued movie set in the Formula One race world the camera gets so close to a driver�۪s eye that you can see each trembling lash. It�۪s a startlingly beautiful but also naked image partly because there�۪s no hiding for an actor when the camera gets that close. In moments like these you�۪re no longer watching a performance with its layers of art and technique: you�۪ve crossed the border between fiction and documentary to go eye to eye with another person�۪s nervous system. Mr. Howard doesn�۪t just want you to crawl inside a Formula One racecar he also wants you to crawl inside its driver�۪s head." he wants to get inside those of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br�_hl) Formula One titans and rivals who in 1976 helped push the sport into mainstream consciousness. (Well at least in much of the rest of the world: Formula One has long struggled in the United States.) In 1976 when both men were in their late 20s they raced after each other while chasing the world championship over wet dry and terrifyingly gnarly tracks. Tucked very much alone into open-wheel machines that could easily have become coffins Hunt and Lauda cut corners and grazed death lap after lap ��� whooshing over racetracks city streets and deceptively pastoral roads into the sort of sports legend that translates only occasionally into good cinema." Hunt was the pretty one a tall blond British playboy who transcended his middle-class background to become racing royalty the King James of newspaper headlines. Born into a wealthy Austrian family the shorter slighter and darker Lauda was by contrast cruelly nicknamed the Rat because of his pronounced overbite. (The Beaver would have been a more apt handle.) Hunt partied hard ��� archival photographs inevitably show him bookended by women his gaze nestled in their d̩colletage ��� while Lauda assumed the role of the frosty teetotaling tactician. They were an ideally matched telegenic salable pair ��� the heartthrob and the master gearhead ��� whose differences in and out of their cars put a playful at times anguished human face onto a sports story." straightforward core. There are all sorts of narratives that could be spun out of Formula One including how lives were sacrificed for profit. (In 1994 Ayrton Senna became the last driver to die in a Grand Prix.) It�۪s hard to believe though that even a down-and-dirty expos̩ would be a fraction as entertaining as ���Rush �۝ which distills the thrill of racing into a clash of personalities one nail-biting face-off a catastrophic accident and a wild comeback. Enzo Ferrari the Ferrari founder (who was called the Saturn or devourer of his children because of the fatalities during his tenure) might have been more important to Formula One than any driver but romances like ���Rush�۝ don�۪t belong to the owners: they belong to the workers the grim ones and the smiling ones the ones with the death wish and the ones with the gushers of Champagne." Hunt is walking barefoot into a hospital bleeding from the nose while still in his racing suit. He�۪s a ravishing mess and his effect on the room which goes immediately silent is unmistakably erotic. ���Hunt James Hunt �۝ he announces echoing a familiar line. Before long a nurse is at once dressing his wound and undressing the rest of him a seduction that�۪s as much about the audience�۪s pleasure as that of the characters on screen. Best known for playing the comic-book hero Thor Mr. Hemsworth is prettier than the all-too-real man he plays in ���Rush.�۝ Yet this surplus of beauty works for the role because the actor who holds the screen with the unconscious physical confidence of the truly lovely looks like the star that James Hunt became." for all the machines and money ���Rush�۝ is a human story about bodies if ones almost always in furious motion. It�۪s also about work about finding ���a drive �۝ as they say in racing and keeping it even after machines and people spectacularly fail. Lauda who�۪s seen buying his way into racing with loans (his family didn�۪t support his passion) isn�۪t a natural physical specimen or showman like Hunt. Yet one of the movie�۪s deepening pleasures is how as the story slyly shifts from one man to the other it peels back the arrogance encasing Lauda who�۪s so abrasive that it�۪s hard not to root against him even as Mr. Br�_hl�۪s dexterous textured performance pulls you close." �۝ and while he has periodically offered up a surprise (the western ���The Missing�۝) he has often mired himself in commercial sludge like ���The Da Vinci Code �۝ sporadically trying to break free with serious-minded prestige items like ���Frost/Nixon.�۝ ���Rush �۝ which is serious without being self-serious fun without being trivial feels like the movie that he has been waiting to make his whole life ��� it�۪s no wonder that he climbs into the cockpits with the camera again and again.

Every so often Hunt and Lauda come briefly down to earth as does the movie especially whenever they resume their roles in their domestic dramas (with Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara). In contrast to similar scenes in movies of this biographical type these family interludes pass by swiftly and largely effortlessly because the filmmakers know as you soon do too that these men were born to do one blissful thing: race to the heart-quickening finish." alcohol and drug consumption and extreme racetrack peril."

�۝ it is easy to see why such stimulus is more than some men can handle. Neil (Josh Gad) one of three male characters in the film who belong to the same 12-step program for sex addiction has a habit of spotting an attractive woman in a subway car sidling up to her and pressing his lower body against hers." the victim appears not to notice until he starts grinding on her at which point she hauls off and slugs him. In another he engages an attractive colleague in conversation while surreptitiously filming under her skirt with his smartphone. That ploy gets him fired from his job as an emergency room medic. He has already been arrested and compelled to join the recovery program." a Jack Black type is the semicomic relief in an otherwise earnest film about the pain of sex addiction. The movie�۪s dourness is divided between Neil�۪s sponsor Adam (Mark Ruffalo) and Adam�۪s sponsor Mike (Tim Robbins). But it is not nearly as bleak as Steve McQueen�۪s ���Shame �۝ whose haunted protagonist prowled a Manhattan that was portrayed as a cold chic circle of hell filled with overheated flesh." who has been in recovery for five years were so consuming that he banished sex (including masturbation pornography and television) from his life. Because he is handsome enough to attract any number of beautiful women with just a look some male viewers may scoff at his rejection of easy conquest. (Remember Warren Beatty�۪s hairdresser in ���Shampoo�۝? That character sent a message that satyriasis can be groovy though the story took place near the end of the swinging �۪60s.)" a recovering alcoholic and the group�۪s self-appointed elder statesman is married and towing a straight and narrow line. He and his wife Monica (Joely Richardson) are sitting down to dinner one evening when their estranged son Danny (Patrick Fugit) appears out of the blue. A longtime drug addict Danny declares he is clean. But Mike is inclined not to believe him." who wrote the screenplay for ���The Kids Are All Right�۝ with Lisa Cholodenko ��� isn�۪t entirely male-oriented. Joining the recovery group is the tattooed spiky-haired Dede (Alecia Moore a k a Pink). Upon turning 30 she realized that the only way she had ever related to men was through sex. She befriends Neil and they become go-to buddies in times of crisis. They are the fun couple in a movie that has a punishing grimly puritanical undertone." Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow) whose previous boyfriend was also an addict. Although Phoebe is very open about having survived breast cancer Adam can�۪t bring himself to tell her of his compulsion. A garrulous diet and fitness fanatic who loves sex Phoebe is a handful. After Adam has come clean about his problem she dons stripper gear and tempts him with a lap dance. It is the last thing in the world he wants because of its association with impersonal pornographic pleasure." its tone is uncertain. It notes only in passing that sex addiction is often connected to substance abuse and compulsive overeating. Adam�۪s inevitable slip suggests a horror movie in which a much younger previous flame with whom he plays sadomasochistic games goes suddenly berserk. Neil�۪s relationship with his suffocatingly adoring mother (Carol Kane) however is played for farce." ���Thanks for Sharing�۝ finally gets to the heart of the matter.

which may be why filmmakers are so fond of it. Nothing sparks a revenge plot or allows a director to trade intellectual nuance for visceral feeling quite as efficiently as a child in peril. When dealing with people who gratuitously cause the innocent to suffer no retribution seems too extreme and the history of movies is full of good men (and a few women) driven to righteous brutality against predators kidnappers and abusers." the enraged grief-addled father played by Hugh Jackman in Denis Villeneuve�۪s ���Prisoners �۝ seems like such a character. ���He�۪s not a person �۝ Keller says of the man he believes is responsible for the abduction of his young daughter and her friend. And this conviction that the apparent perpetrator has forfeited his humanity allows an honorable family man to contemplate torture and murder. He beats his captive bloody and locks him in a makeshift cell in an abandoned building hoping to extract the truth and perhaps also a measure of rough justice. When the other girl�۪s parents (Viola Davis and Terrence Howard) express doubts about what Keller is doing their qualms strike him as evidence of weakness and irrationality." �۝ written by Aaron Guzikowski upholds some of the conventions of the angry-dad revenge drama it also subverts them in surprising at times devastating ways. The easy catharsis of righteous payback is complicated at every turn and pain and uncertainty spread like spilled oil on an asphalt road." Anna and Joy go missing late on Thanksgiving afternoon suspicion focuses on the driver of a camper that had been parked in their small-town Pennsylvania neighborhood. An arrest is made of a young man (Paul Dano) who seems mentally disabled and shares no information about the girls�۪ whereabouts. Then a dead body is found in an elderly priest�۪s basement and a second young man with a nervous manner and a haunted look shows up at a vigil for the missing children and runs away into the night. False leads and shadowy connections proliferate and nobody knows if Anna and Joy are dead or alive." and ���Prisoners�۝ is among other things a satisfying whodunit with artfully deposited clues and twists that are surprising without entirely undermining the film�۪s naturalistic credibility." a French Canadian director whose previous movies include ���Incendies�۝ and ���Polytechnique �۝ is more invested in mood and meaning than in plot. A connoisseur of grim tales ��� ���Incendies�۝ is about the endless trauma of a Middle Eastern civil war; ���Polytechnique�۝ is based on the true story of a shooting rampage at a Montreal university ��� he has an intense almost philosophical interest in the nature of evil." �۝ ���Mystic River�۝ and ���The Silence of the Lambs �۝ ���Prisoners�۝ suggests that evil is not confined to a single person or set of actions. Crimes are specified and criminals are discovered but empirical solutions are not enough to dispel the feeling that an uncontained atmospheric menace broods over this wintry landscape. (Roger A. Deakins�۪s somber cinematography turns the Keystone State into a study of grays and browns dead leaves and bare trees under a sky like wet metal.)" a survivalist with a basement full of canned goods and batteries seems to have been infected by it even before the disappearance of his daughter. His wife (Maria Bello) tips into a pool of despair. Other people like the aunt of one of the suspects (Melissa Leo) are weighed down by bad luck and weary dread." whose connection to the kidnapping is professional rather than personal. Like Keller Loki is a familiar figure in a movie like this and the contrast between them ��� the hotheaded impulsive avenger and the cool careful sleuth ��� is something we�۪ve seen before. Mr. Jackman is solid and persuasive but it is Mr. Gyllenhaal with his downturned mouth and twitchy eyes who anchors the film. We know nothing of Loki�۪s off-duty life if he even has one but he is the sensitive skeptical filter through which we try to imagine the fate that could have befallen two happy children playing on a November afternoon." but Mr. Villeneuve wisely ��� if also somewhat cruelly ��� refuses to speed up or to spike the action with jolts of adrenaline. He captures with impressive discipline just how slowly time can move during a crisis how the static condition of not knowing can press down on every moment. Panic can be paralyzing as it is for Keller�۪s wife and Joy�۪s parents but acting rashly as Keller is inclined to can have catastrophic effects." exhaling in relief or amazement at each new revelation. By the end you may be a little worn out and perhaps also slightly let down by the fussily clever revelations that wrap up the story but in the meantime you are a willing captive unable to tell the difference between dread and delight."

It culminates in the revelation that two of the workers in the picture were possibly from a small Irish village which seems a detour from the American grandeur and casual bravery on which the film focuses.

�۝ says Eva the Los Angeles massage therapist whose midlife travails are the subject of ���Enough Said �۝ a small miracle of a movie written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. It is possible to sympathize with Eva and also to marvel at her curious sense of timing. Happily ��� or at least not miserably ��� divorced with nice friends and a gratifyingly nondysfunctional teenage daughter Eva played by the reliably hilarious Julia Louis-Dreyfus uses her sense of humor as a social tool and an emotional defense. She�۪s a good sport a designated joker which is fine except that it means that she never has to be taken seriously even by herself." for the first time with Albert (James Gandolfini) ��� also the divorced parent of a girl soon to leave for college ��� Eva senses another possibility. This guy whom she met at a party and recently started dating might actually get her not just her jokes. He agreeably and gallantly says that he�۪s also tired of being funny. ���But you�۪re not funny �۝ she says as they snuggle against each other laughing at her own quick wit and also paying him a sincere if somewhat backhanded compliment." scene for scene it is one of the best-written American film comedies in recent memory and an implicit rebuke to the raunchy sloppy spectacles of immaturity that have dominated the genre in recent years." an acute observer of the manners and morals of the self-satisfied metropolitan middle class West Coast division is decorous or genteel. She is rather almost ruthless in her attention to the petty vanities and hypocrisies of her characters and the ways their relatively privileged circumstances lead them to weave webs of guilt complacency and stifled aggression." even ��� or especially ��� when they are ridiculous myopic or mean. This has been apparent in all of her features so far from ���Walking and Talking�۝ (1996) through ���Lovely and Amazing�۝ (2002) ���Friends With Money�۝ (2006) and ���Please Give�۝ (2010). Their only real flaw is scarcity. Ideally Ms. Holofcener would be able to work at a Woody Allen pace issuing annual bulletins from the lives of people who after 15 or 20 minutes already seem like your friends." they are exasperating and difficult as well as lovable. Ms. Louis-Dreyfus was memorably described (in her ���Seinfeld�۝ persona) as a pretty woman with ���a face like a frying pan.�۝ That face has matured into a remarkably expressive instrument. Eva is like no other movie character I have ever seen and uncannily like a lot of real women I know. Motherhood on the big screen is typically viewed with pity sentimentality or resentment and romantic love tends to be treated in a similarly reductive manner as an impossible dream or a state of earthly bliss. Ms. Louis-Dreyfus and Ms. Holofcener know better and they approach Eva�۪s emotional adventures as mother lover and friend as a series of practical and ethical challenges." Ellen (the wonderfully sensitive Tracey Fairaway) are each complicated by a third person whose presence at first seems benign or irrelevant. Eva�۪s closeness to Ellen�۪s needy best friend Chloe (Tavi Gevinson) provokes some jealousy as Ellen prepares to leave home. Meanwhile she has acquired a new client and friend: Marianne (Catherine Keener) a poet with exquisite taste and an aura of high bohemian glamour who happens to be Albert�۪s former wife." but Ms. Holofcener tilts it a few degrees. Does it matter that the things about Albert that Eva finds charming drive Marianne crazy? Should it?" amusing as it is to watch Eva struggle to figure out what to do with the Too Much Information that Marianne has been unwittingly feeding her. To Eva Albert is a sweet sexy affable slob but his ex remembers him as a bore and a loser clumsy in bed and incapable of taking care of himself. Partly because she is dazzled by the friendship of someone who writes incomprehensible verse serves exotic iced tea and hangs out with Joni Mitchell Eva absorbs Marianne�۪s perspective and tries with obnoxious good intentions to correct Albert�۪s faults." Sarah and Will (Toni Collette and Ben Falcone) exist in a state of easy affectionate tolerance that is often hard to distinguish from seething contempt. Eva and her ex-husband (Toby Huss) get along as well as they do because they have given up on each other. Albert and Eva�۪s romance feels exciting and perilous because there is something at stake." so playful and alive in one of his final major movie roles and feeling once again the loss of his remarkable gift. There is also the pang of the empty nest that mixture of grief and pride that is the special anguish of modern parents." uncovered a zone of anxiety fear and hope that has rarely been explored with such empathy or precision. Eva like many of us lives in a world where the rules and roles are puzzling ��� where parental authority is negotiable marriage vows are revocable and social boundaries are never clearly marked." the primal values of right and wrong ��� the requirements of compassion honesty and honorable action ��� still apply. It is easy to make mistakes and hard to correct them easy to be funny and hard to be good."

A nimble montage of Mr. Berliner�۪s visits ��� Mr. Honig was his cousin ��� neatly establishes an award-winning poet�۪s failing memory and yet open mind as well as a filmmaker�۪s touching persistence." mirror on the wall �۝ Mr. Berliner says at one point in the stop-and-start questions and answers that follow. ���You be camera and I�۪ll be all �۝ Mr. Honig responds." with his aquiline nose shock of white hair and knowing gaze making it easy to picture him in the past as a professor critic and mentor. Into the oblivion of advanced age he freestyles poetry and offers frank answers or blank verbal shrugs. But Mr. Berliner like a painter working at different times of day also shows Mr. Honig speechless making birdlike noises or simply drumming on the arms of his chair." unified portrait of a poet and a human being. Language and self come across as intertwined and (as for all of us) perhaps more unstable or fluid than we like to admit. Yet even when all else has failed rhythm and sound endure for Mr. Honig (the drumming the noises). Mr. Berliner�۪s use of typewriter key-punches and pings ��� a sonic motif he has used before ��� never lets text and writing fade from the story." only to be mercilessly critical as they grew. And since Mr. Honig�۪s family members are in a roundabout way Mr. Berliner�۪s the movie enters into a generational dialogue with this filmmaker�۪s ongoing project in cinematic genealogy. ���First Cousin Once Removed�۝ echoes ���Nobody�۪s Business �۝ Mr. Berliner�۪s 1996 movie about his hilariously resistant father (who appears briefly here considerably subdued) or ���Intimate Stranger �۝ his 1991 attempt to reconstruct his Sephardic maternal grandfather�۪s history." playing with a delighted Mr. Honig and one can sense a certain urgency in the filmmaker�۪s compassion ��� a desire to draw out his cousin that approaches need. It�۪s an urge to communicate even commune that one can readily sympathize with and Mr. Berliner�۪s film bravely brings us to the edge of language and experience."

Ike is afraid that he will seek another wife. Her mother-in-law proposes a solution that is at once shocking and bluntly practical." except to say that the matriarch�۪s plan pushes ���Mother of George�۝ decisively in the direction of melodrama. This is not meant as criticism. The strain of rich and anguished feeling in this movie enhanced by Philip Miller�۪s music and Mr. Young�۪s color-saturated luminous images is downright exhilarating and Mr. Dosunmu manages it with a graceful nimble touch." while finding eloquence in the faces and gestures of the actors. He is a master of the unexpected close-up making hands and feet as expressive as voices and eyes." �۝ Rama Burshtein�۪s wonderful recent film about a young Orthodox Jewish woman facing a difficult life-changing decision. What these movies share is a refusal to treat their characters as in any way exotic to view them from the inevitably condescending perspective of Western secular modernity. In both cases the heroines are challenged and constrained by the requirements of tradition but they are also self-aware and free to choose however painful the choices." a Nigerian and a New Yorker ��� illuminates their world with confidence and sensitivity.

Alan Greenspan his successor does not and the film builds to the argument that the current chairman Ben Bernanke is leading us toward a new financial disaster by keeping interest rates low. Cheeky visuals ��� an atomic bomb exploding; a man being shot out of a cannon; endless images of Jenga blocks ��� help convey the view that the Fed is cavalier about acting in the public interest."

Or that Monsanto and other producers of these modified goods have spent a great deal of money to ensure that things stay that way." Mr. Seifert�۪s partisan oversimplified survey falls short. Approaching this extremely complicated topic with the air of an innocent seeker he barely touches on the science behind the genetically modified organisms (G.M.O.) that are introduced into the food focusing instead on tumor-encrusted G.M.O.-fed rats: the product of a study that has since been scientifically questioned." while undeniably diverting again fail to excavate the economic social and ethical ramifications of seed patenting.

Cinephiles and festivalgoers may recognize their names from previous collaborations like ���To Die Like a Man �۝ a playfully overbaked melodrama about an ill-fated preoperative transsexual. Candy has serious problems too a man calling himself Guerra da Mata explains in voice-over shortly after ���The Last Time I Saw Macao�۝ gets going.

It remains unclear if this voice and face actually belong to one of the filmmakers a confusion that increases when a second male voice (presumably that of Mr. Rodrigues) chimes in on the soundtrack. As this fragmentation suggests the on-screen figure of Guerra da Mata is purposely an abstraction more narrative code than character. Mostly he serves as a visual marker something to hold onto as the two voices offer up streams of personal memories geopolitical observations offbeat asides and paranoid neo-noir musings that after a fashion give essayistic shape to the movie�۪s overextended 85 minutes." Macau became like Hong Kong a special administrative region of China in the late 1990s. China maintains its claim on Macau through a concept known as ���one country two systems �۝ a bifurcation that in ���The Last Time I Saw Macao �۝ is embodied by Candy (as a transsexual but also as a Jane Russell impersonator) and echoed by other doublings like that of the tag-team voice-over and fact-fiction form.

As he roams around trying to find Candy he pauses here and there the camera capturing documentary images of Macau�۪s citizens and visitors its wild dogs and feral cats. Like a lot of classic heroes he is mapping a place as he looks for a dame uncovering her traces among the ghosts of the past the banalities of the present and the uncertainties of the future."

He is also speaking the literal truth." the main characters in Alexandre Moors�۪s ���Blue Caprice �۝ are based on John A. Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo who terrorized the greater Washington area in the fall of 2002 with a series of murderous sniper attacks. Under John�۪s guidance Lee a lost and lonely teenager has been transformed into a steady-handed deadeye of a killer." at a time of raw nerves and war fever the Beltway sniper shootings have since faded into the annals of American crime one of those dreadful senseless eruptions that periodically seize our attention and galvanize our fears. Mr. Moors a New York-based French director of music videos making his feature debut starts his film with a flurry of 911 calls and local news clips reminding us of the fear and confusion that accompanied the rampage. But most of ���Blue Caprice�۝ takes place before the shootings in Washington State and its emphasis is on the bond that formed between the killers." �۝ suggested by the Columbine school shootings is perhaps the most accomplished example of the anti-interpretive approach steadily refusing to guide the viewer toward the consolation of meaning. ���Blue Caprice �۝ named for the car John and Lee modify into a stealth assault vehicle follows a middle path." allowing their inner lives to remain enigmatic.

John refers to Lee as his son teaches him to drive and to shoot and demands proofs of filial love in the form of acts of violence. His kindness is punctuated by strange and cruel disciplinary action as when he leaves Lee tied to a tree on a rainy night trusting that the boy will escape and come home for breakfast." John lays out a vision that will mutate into a plan. A series of random brazen murders he says will ultimately bring down the shadowy oppressive system that he believes is at the root of all his problems. His worldview is a stew of vague political and racial resentments combined with specific grievances. ���They�۝ stole his children ruined his marriage and messed up his life and his adopted son will be the instrument of his revenge." unhinged though he may be is more readable than Lee whose brooding wounded silence is the film�۪s center of gravity.

As it drifts from topic to topic its characters debate war heroism mortality and social change. Another theme of the movie set during the Vietnam War is generational strife exemplified by the Caldwells�۪ strident pro- and antiwar factions." a fierce die-hard hawk who fought in World War I trots out all the snarling epithets applied to late �۪60s war protesters.

Naomi�۪s second husband Kingsley Bedford (John Hurt) soon arrives with his grown-up children from an earlier marriage Phillip (Ray Stevenson) and Camilla (Frances O�۪Connor)." one down-home and raucous the other reserved and English are mildly entertaining set pieces portraying cultural collisions in which suspicion and hostility are camouflaged by Southern hospitality and English manners. Aside from Jim�۪s introduction to psychedelics there are no dramatic fireworks." Skip aroused by Camilla�۪s English accent persuades her to disrobe and recite poetry while he masturbates. It swerves again when she persuades him to reciprocate and Mr. Thornton delivers the movie�۪s most touching monologue in which he recalls nearly dying when his plane caught fire. Mr. Thornton shines in this soliloquy which leaves you catching your breath." ���Jayne Mansfield�۪s Car�۝ could be described as a macho weepie. But in its best moments you can see what the film might have been with half a dozen fewer characters. Behind the clunky machinery is a lyrical meditation on life death heroism regret and forgiveness written in a florid style that might be described as Tennessee Williams on testosterone." sexual content nudity drug use and some bloody images."

They�۪ve lost any frisson of the exotic and forbidden." in which Kate Bosworth and Iddo Goldberg play a young married couple who travel to Italy and face the reality of their loveless marriage is an undisguised homage to Roberto Rossellini�۪s ���Voyage to Italy�۝ and to a lesser extent Michelangelo Antonioni�۪s film ���L�۪Avventura.�۝" even radical a half-century ago may be impossible to refresh though the screenplay by Ms. Coiro has a firm grasp of its characters.

The movie has lots of pretty scenery." the upper-middle-class ennui they revealed was a topic left largely unexplored by movies. The world was poorer then and still recovering from a cataclysmic war. Those movies examined the friction between Old World traditions and modernism." the kind of boredom and discontent expressed by the characters in ���And While We Were Here�۝ permeates the movies and television and is a clich̩ of contemporary life.

Caleb (Jamie Blackley) reveals himself to be an American they fall into a conversation and eventually begin an affair. A little romantic sex chases Jane�۪s blues away and gives her the courage to pressure Leonard to confront their stasis and his reluctance to address painful subjects." who has a lively wit ��� he tells amusing viola jokes ��� is still a boy but he conveys a restless life force that sweeps Jane up. Beside Mr. Blackley even the radiant Ms. Bosworth exhibits a certain sourness. Sadly however the marital crisis at the movie�۪s heart has lost its allegorical weight.

Barely altered in the last five decades its hummocks and hollows folds and crevasses ��� captured here in magical black and white ��� are a playground for Seamus McGarvey�۪s delighted camera. When Mr. Stanton sings in a surprisingly resilient tenor (preferring songs that are blue in title and mood) that camera turns us all into besotted lovers unable to look away. These melancholy performances could emerge from a painful Kentucky childhood or reflections on the progeny possibly scattered in his wake or a lingering heartache over the long-ago loss of a sweetheart Rebecca De Mornay to a lucky Tom Cruise. Mr. Stanton isn�۪t elaborating."

With his hypertrophied body and Barry White purr Mr. Diesel ��� much like his more sweetly appealing brother in brawn Dwayne Johnson ��� embodies a particularly salient caricature of masculinity one that appears to transcend obvious racial identity to make him an ideal modern Everybrute. If Arnold and Sly became the cartoon emblems of Reagan-era might Mr. Diesel has come into his own as a contemporary hero one who suggests a postrace ideal even as he affirms old-fashioned power with displays of annihilating violence." which opened with the aptly grim and gloomy ���Pitch Black�۝ (2000) and immediately entered its decadent phase with the unintentionally self-parodic ���Chronicles of Riddick�۝ (2004). The series director and writer (sometimes co-writer) David Twohy has smartly gone back to genre basics with this installment which serves as an effective reboot. Gone are the silly costumes and wigs the overstuffed plot and exotic-sounding villains like the Necromongers the religious fanatics that Mr. Diesel�۪s character the escaped convict more formally known as Richard B. Riddick once battled. Now there�۪s one man alone stranded on a seemingly desolate distant planet with only his wits his fists and his voice-over." the landscape atmospherically barren and the action nice and tight. If you didn�۪t see or can�۪t remember the last movie no matter because after a few pro forma nods to ���Chronicles�۝ (cue Karl Urban in eyeliner and leather shoulder pads) Mr. Twohy gets right to it. Riddick is wounded and seemingly down for the count. ���Don�۪t know how many times �۝ he growls ���I�۪ve been crossed off the list and left for dead.�۝ Surrounded by craggy cliffs that evoke John Ford�۪s Monument Valley as reworked for the cover of a science-fiction pulp he stares into the computer-generated void. Instead of vultures dinosaurlike scavengers swoop down at his head; instead of wolves he goes mano a mano with wittily conceptualized critters that look like juiced-up hyenas." an elemental fight that has a nice metaphoric resonance for the series. It�۪s as if having almost lost the character amid so much narrative bloat Mr. Twohy were returning Riddick and the franchise to their origins stripping them down to their genre bones. Riddick even undergoes a ritual purification emerging from a pool of liquid like Martin Sheen�۪s psychotic warrior in ���Apocalypse Now.�۝ Mr. Twohy�۪s reference to ���Apocalypse Now�۝ can be read as just another ceremonial nod at a cinematic touchstone one that seeks to suggest affinity merely through quotation. Whatever Mr. Twohy�۪s intentions and no matter how aspirational the allusion the image works because it telegraphs one simple idea: Riddick is reborn y�۪all." Riddick the legendary interplanetary killer must be baptized in blood.

(The film itself credits Paul Alexander�۪s biography of Salinger as its source.) ���Acclaimed�۝ is perhaps wishful thinking but the most dubious words in that puffy phrase are ���documentary film.�۝ There are plenty of archival images and talking-head interviews but ���Salinger �۝ directed by Mr. Salerno is less a work of cinema than the byproduct of its own publicity campaign. It does not so much explore the life and times of J. D. Salinger as run his memory and legacy through a spin cycle of hype. Salinger moved to the woods of New Hampshire partly to escape the intrusions and indignities of American celebrity culture. ���Salinger�۝ is that culture�۪s revenge." a dogged researcher and tireless interviewer assembles his documentary material (supplemented by re-enactments and propelled by a throbbing action-movie score) into a breathless story full of hyperbole and speculation. The resulting blend of reverence and character assassination is an almost perfect distillation of the modern pathology of fame. Salinger a talented hard-working and very popular writer who died in 2010 is built up into a world-historical literary genius. Though a few negative reviews are mentioned ��� by Mary McCarthy and John Updike most notably ��� they are drowned out by a chorus of extravagant praise. High school students and movie stars testify that ���The Catcher in the Rye�۝ changed their lives and changed the world." and the fortress of privacy he erected around it torn down. A run-of-the-mill eccentric author of short stories might be left alone in the hills above the Connecticut River but a genius of this caliber whose books have been declared the common property of all humanity is clearly asking to be exposed. And several of his stalkers ��� journalists and fans who staked out Salinger�۪s local post office or roosted at the bottom of his driveway ��� choose to interpret his supposed reclusiveness as a covert demand for attention." one of many that flicker into view during ���Salinger �۝ only to be dissolved in the acid of sensationalism. Some of the film�۪s most intriguing information has to do with Salinger�۪s experiences in World War II where he endured almost 300 days in combat and took part in the liberation of Dachau. He stayed in Europe after V-E Day to work with the Army Counterintelligence Corps and was briefly married to a German woman who may have been a Nazi.

His behavior with them sheds a queasy light on his fiction which often dwells on the precocity and half-innocence of characters perched on the brink of ruinous disillusionment." but in the meantime Salinger fans will have to contend with this garish and confusing portrait. There are insights that can be plucked from it but to do so requires strenuous resistance to the spirit of the project (both book and film) which is not just leering and gossipy but aggressively anti-literary." apart from a few snippets of letters in the possession of their recipients. The film is dealing with an author notoriously protective of his copyright. (One of the few times he initiated contact with a journalist was to expose and try to suppress the circulation of pirated editions of early stories). But it is curious that a movie about such a notorious perfectionist should be so sloppy in matters of judgment and craft. The re-enactments ��� in which a dark-haired figure in a suit paces a darkened stage and pounds away at a typewriter or else (dressed in a blue jumpsuit) lumbers through the forest with an ax ��� are embarrassingly literal. And the conversation about the place of ���The Catcher in the Rye�۝ in the imaginations of a few notorious killers would be a parody of hyperventilating tabloidism if it were not so obviously the real thing."

Its pheromones are supplied by D̩borah Fran̤ois a wide-eyed 26-year-old beauty who plays Rose Pamphyle a budding blond Cinderella from a town in Normandy who ascends from secretary to national speed-typing champion in the late 1950s. As her star rises and she becomes a celebrity she transforms from pony-tailed ing̩nue to elegantly coifed princess without losing an ingenuousness that recalls the young Audrey Hepburn." Charlotte David�۪s costumes and the candy-colored pastel cinematography of Guillaume Schiffman who was nominated for an Oscar as the cinematographer of ���The Artist.�۝ The music by Rob and Emmanuel D�۪Orlando is an effective pre-Beatles pastiche of cha-cha-chas mambos and plastic teen pop. But the most evocative theme is Leroy Anderson�۪s ���Forgotten Dreams �۝ a wistful musical bonbon for piano and strings that captures the misty lost-in-the-clouds mood of a more innocent era." the movie conjures a dream world in which getting a job as a secretary is the next-best thing to going to heaven in the minds of young women eyeing career possibilities. Secretary is now almost a taboo word that can be freighted with sexist condescension but in those pre-feminist days many women accepted labels like secretary and stewardess with pride because they signified status mobility and sophistication." a suave insurance agent with a playboy mystique. Impressed by the speed with which Rose types using only one finger on each hand Louis imagines that she could be a champion in the competitive female sport of speed typing which in the movie�۪s daffy comedic imagination is all the rage. I haven�۪t come across evidence that speed-typing competitions were ever a national obsession in France or anywhere else. But the conceit makes for an amusing premise as Rose works her way up from the French provinces to an international competition at a packed theater in New York City." Louis invites her to live in his mansion while he grooms her as you would an Olympian providing her with intensive piano and touch-typing lessons. Love blooms. Mr. Duris is more than satisfactory as Louis a rakish commitment-phobe but his pugilist�۪s mug doesn�۪t quite fit the role of smooth operator. The screenplay written by the director with Daniel Presley and Romain Compingt throws in a halfhearted subplot involving Louis�۪s former girlfriend Marie (B̩r̩nice B̩jo of ���The Artist�۝) now married to his best friend Bob an American." executing the kind of grand flourishes with each return of the carriage that Liberace exhibited at the piano." ���Populaire�۝ (named after a brand of typewriter Rose is shown hawking in television commercials) is a distant cousin to ���Mad Men �۝ with Rose resembling Peggy Marie suggesting Joan and Louis a Don Draper stand-in. But it would be foolish to push the similarities beyond the superficial. More apt comparisons are to Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedies in which Ms. Day fiercely guarded her virginity as if the future of the world depended on her chastity. ���Populaire�۝ being a French movie however virginity or lack thereof is a ho-hum matter." in which the demure discreetly flirtatious Rose stands up to Louis whenever he is too overbearing. At one point Rose declares that her ideal man is ���one who sees me as an equal.�۝ That at least is a start."

His reasons for the affair are never broached presumably because it�۪s meant to be self-evident why a teenage boy would want to sleep with his pretty hot-to-trot teacher. The implication is that he would emerge from the affair just fine which effectively makes him a prop in what becomes a portrait of a psychological meltdown. To that narrative end Ms. Fidell tries to suggest a sense of Diana�۪s internal weather notably her isolation which is telegraphed with many shots of her by herself literally or alone in the frame.

These headline fragments temporally situate you which is helpful because Mr. Philibert shuns conventional nonfiction signposts like voice-overs and on-screen information. Instead using a stationary camera (the absence of jiggle is nice) and a fly-on-the-wall approach he inserts you into rooms next to bodies and among voices. None of these are identified while they�۪re on camera but if you know what the veteran screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri̬re looks like or if you stick around to read the end credits you will know he�۪s one of the guests who pass through. A somewhat jolly Umberto Eco shows up in a studio at one point too." although Mr. Philibert has said that he and his team shot for six months from January to July 2011. This synthetic time frame gives all the material a narrative shape turning snippets from different weeks months and broadcasts into a day-in-the-life story. As in many such stories there are also leading men and women along with the supporting cast members and guest stars like Mr. Eco. Among the most vivid main characters is Marguerite Gateau who sits behind a console at times with her head somewhat cocked ��� as if she were picking up frequencies the rest of us can�۪t hear ��� and directs performers for a dramatic program on the subtlest line readings guiding them with admirable serenity past fumbled words." even for the brief time she�۪s on screen and it�۪s understandable that Mr. Philibert continues to return to her along with a grimly funny Marie-Claude Rabot-Pinson whose job seems to be pulling choice news items from the information flowing in. Yet the precise nature of Ms. Rabot-Pinson�۪s job remains frustratingly unclear. Does she make assignments write the news edit copy? Who knows? It�۪s similarly unclear if Ms. Gateau only directs performers or if she also casts them. Mr. Philibert�۪s intimate calm style can be very appealing as can be his patience both of which were crucial to turning his 2002 documentary ���To Be and to Have�۝ ��� which follows a class of schoolchildren and their teacher over a year ��� into an epic of human emotion." �۝ like a brief lightly comic visit with a classical music personality who�۪s plonked behind a stack of CDs so towering that he looks like a drowning man.

So there is something refreshing about the way Mr. De Palma infuses the sterile gleaming Berlin offices of a global advertising firm with his high-toned elegant naughtiness. ���Passion�۝ is a swirl of bright color and arresting compositions many of them involving red lipstick high-heeled shoes fancy lingerie expensive Champagne and other venerable tenets of the Playboy Philosophy." exactly. Its misogyny is the kind that can plausibly masquerade as feminism and ���Passion�۝ is interesting precisely insofar as it succeeds in scrambling the distinction. Remaking a French thriller by Alain Corneau (called ���Love Crime�۝ in English and released in the United States in 2011) Mr. De Palma imagines a corporate ��� and an erotic ��� landscape in which women are dominant and submissive predators and prey." a rising executive played by Rachel McAdams alternately nurtures betrays humiliates and makes passes at Isabelle (Noomi Rapace) her spooked passive (or perhaps passive-aggressive) underling. Isabelle trembles in fear plots revenge and visits her own version of good-boss bad-boss psychological warfare on her assistant Dani (Karoline Herfurth). Their three-way tangle is less a love triangle than a cat-and-mouse game with shifting roles. It is also an exercise in color coding inviting us to ponder stereotypical ideas about blondes brunettes and redheads and also to admire the cinematic properties of hair." apart from the silver-haired suits who watch the game (and occasionally perhaps unwittingly manipulate the players) are mostly fools and patsies. One is a skinny unshaven fellow named Dirk (Paul Anderson) who sleeps with Christine and Isabelle and pays dearly for his pleasures. Another is Inspector Bach (Rainer Bock) an earnest German detective with the unhappy task of unraveling a murder that does less than you might think to resolve the cat-and-mouse question." though the crime is neither entirely a surprise nor exactly a mystery. It does allow Mr. De Palma to revisit some of his longstanding preoccupations: with characters who double each other; with deceit and disguise; with mirrors corridors wigs and staircases. Pino Donaggio�۪s vivid sensuous perversely jaunty musical score emphasizes the almost campy artifice of the drama which is played out by actors who rarely seem to believe what they are saying." ���Passion�۝ both improves on Mr. Corneau�۪s film and also exposes its shortcomings. ���Love Crime�۝ (which starred Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier) pretended ��� or tried ��� to be a workplace satire and a knowing comedy of feminine behavior as well as a bloody potboiler.

Mr. De Palma retaining the basic structure of his source sets out in search of the surreal and the preposterous which he has never had much trouble finding." dispensing titillation suspense and a few laughs without taking itself too seriously. Mr. De Palma as he did in ���Femme Fatale �۝ revels in a sleek chic idea of Europe that is as far from reality (and as much fun to visit) as Woody Allen�۪s in ���Midnight in Paris.�۝ The cast seems a bit less comfortable. Ms. McAdams can�۪t quite settle on the right measure of meanness and Ms. Rapace is reluctant to shed the scary intensity that carried her through the Swedish ���Girl With the Dragon Tattoo�۝ series.

�۝ a slick tasty slice of late-summer nonsense from Britain comes soaked in gunmetal blue and paranoia. The anxiety is well founded: they�۪re watching us. A lot ��� especially through the ubiquitous closed-circuit television cameras that dot London like neighborhood constables or plague sores depending on your view of life in the surveillance state. Millions of these cameras watch over Britain at least half of which seem as if they�۪d been tapped for this movie to lord down from lampposts and buildings over the little people below including a concerned-looking yet manly Eric Bana and an equally fretful fetching Rebecca Hall." lawyers who have been recruited to defend a Turkish immigrant Farroukh (Denis Moschitto) accused of murdering more than a hundred people in a London truck-bomb explosion. Officially the lawyers are not supposed to have any conflicts of interest but in one of those nominal coincidences for which movies were made they�۪re former lovers. It would have been a refreshing change to see an attractive male character and an attractive female character behave just as they sometimes do in life ��� you know professionally. But a movie in which the male and female leads didn�۪t paw each other probably would have been a tougher sell; hence the moony looks and hazy flashbacks to the way they were." John Crowley handles Steve Knight�۪s snaky script capably introducing the characters their backgrounds and the political stakes in bold strokes. Mr. Crowley spends a lot of face time with Mr. Bana and Ms. Hall likable performers who consciously or not sometimes convey almost imperceptible tremors of self-doubt beneath even the most polished exteriors. There�۪s an unsettled quality to both as if they were worried about being caught at something (being the leads in movies perhaps). That hesitation works for their characters who however much united by their past and the editing are divided by their duties: Martin has been assigned as Farroukh�۪s defense lawyer while Claudia is his special advocate." they�۪re not privy to the same evidence: Only Claudia as the special advocate is allowed to examine classified material. For a brief time Martin wears out his shoe leather and eyesight the old-fashioned way by running down information and poring through files while Claudia sits squirreled away in a different office. This separate unequal access to the evidence may stir outrage in the real world but since the image of two people working in offices isn�۪t very sexy the movie soon shifts into thriller mode. Before long the two are up and running apart and then together chasing and being chased amid the swelling intrigue and shady characters including an American journalist (Julia Stiles) and a British intelligence officer (Riz Ahmed very fine)." jittery history as it does in Britain including the early films of Alfred Hitchcock. Some of the more recent most convincing British paranoid thrillers have been television productions like the 2003 series ���State of Play.�۝ (It was squeezed into a disappointing American movie of the same title.) With its hushed suspicions breathless rushing and gleaming surfaces ��� from certain lofty angles the London in this movie looks like a science-fiction reimagining of a medieval fortress town ��� ���Closed Circuit�۝ evokes the original ���State of Play �۝ but without the breadth or depth. One problem is that at an hour and a half ���Closed Circuit�۝ can only gesture in certain directions including the less heroic more appealingly human qualities of Martin and Claudia." �۝ the nameless attorney general overseeing the trial on behalf of the crown (Jim Broadbent) offers up another reason Martin and Claudia have been brought together hinting at character complexity that never emerges. Mr. Broadbent excels at playing and at times overplaying flustered friendly types with sly impish smiles. He�۪s rather more polished here than he often looks on screen with tailored clothing and smart glasses but there�۪s a lethal menace to that smile now as he plays the avuncular old gent with a stiletto up his sleeve. Alas the stiletto is purely metaphoric but when Mr. Broadbent delivers a line like ���There are powers at play that neither you nor I may even hope to control�۝ (a line suggestive of a John le Carr̩ bureaucrat) he takes you fleetingly enjoyably over to the dark side." violence and adult language."

Adam Wingard�۪s ���You�۪re Next�۝ strays just enough from formula to tweak our jaded appetites. That it does so without spraying the gore to geyserlike excess says a great deal about Mr. Wingard�۪s sensibility. Never one to linger ghoulishly over violence ��� or to rely on bloodletting to plug a weak script ��� he prefers to strike and move on." shocking prologue the movie invites us to the isolated country estate of a wealthy couple (Rob Moran and Barbara Crampton) where an awkward family reunion is under way. As old rivalries and resentments threaten to derail dinner the 10 adults are interrupted by uninvited visitors ��� wearing animal masks toting crossbows and intent on killing anything that moves." but the pleasure lies in Andrew Droz Palermo�۪s unusually tactile photography ��� we can almost feel the viscosity of a stream of orange juice ��� and a table-turning plot by Simon Barrett that checks the genre boxes while still surprising us. The humor is subdued and sneaky (a documentary filmmaker played by the horror director Ti West is the first to be offed) and the balance of wipeouts and wisecracks is pleasingly fluid. And if Mr. Wingard�۪s moviemaking buddies (like Joe Swanberg and Larry Fessenden) are more talented behind the camera than in front of it the rest of the cast ��� especially the hardworking Sharni Vinson as an Australian guest with a secret past ��� easily makes up the difference." Mr. Wingard has an oblique under-the-radar style that lingers sometimes obsessively on details. (This was most pronounced in his 2011 feature ���A Horrible Way to Die.�۝) His real talent however may lie in editing: choreographing more than a dozen crashing-around characters isn�۪t for sissies. On the evidence of this film having a large family isn�۪t so hot either." skulls are tenderized and necks are garroted."

�۝ a hypnotically beautiful dream from the Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai opens with curls of smoke eddies of water and men soaring and flying across the frame as effortlessly as silk ribbons. The men are warriors street fighters with furious fists and winged feet who have massed together on a dark rainy night to take on Ip Man (Tony Leung) a still figure in a long coat and an elegant white hat. Even amid the violent whirlpools of rain and bodies that hat never leaves his head. It�۪s as unyielding as its owner." which retains its iconographic power even when Ip Man takes it off to say take down a roomful of opponents. The white hat may be an invention ��� in many archival photos of the real Ip Man (1893-1972) a revered martial-arts master he�۪s bareheaded ��� but there�۪s a mythic air to the dashing figure wearing it. However much history informs this movie ���The Grandmaster�۝ is at its most persuasive about the triumph of style. When Ip Man slyly asks ���What�۪s your style?�۝ it�۪s clear that Mr. Wong is asking the same question because here as in his other films style isn�۪t reducible to ravishing surfaces; it�۪s an expression of meaning." one of the greatest filmmakers working today had a new movie and it�۪s a pleasure to have him back. His last ���Ashes of Time Redux �۝ released in 2008 was new only in that it was a reworking of his 1994 ���Ashes of Time �۝ an elliptical meditation on memory in the cloak of a swordsman movie. Perhaps taking a cue from Francis Ford Coppola�۪s ���Apocalypse Now Redux �۝ Mr. Wong returned to ���Ashes of Time �۝ stirred it a bit and emerged with an even lovelier version of that signature work. If the first film definitively signaled that his interests transcended genre and conventional narrative ���Redux�۝ largely felt like a necessary palate cleanser after ���My Blueberry Nights �۝ his only English-language film and only dud." though to describe it as such is somewhat like calling ���L�۪avventura�۝ a thriller about a missing woman. Arguments can be made but would miss the mark. So would expectations of historical fidelity. Predictably ���The Grandmaster�۝ is given this filmmaker less a straight biographical portrait of Ip Man and more an exploration of opposing forces like loyalty and love horizontal and vertical and the geometry of bodies moving through space and time. Ip Man�۪s experience as a martial arts master and even as a teacher to Bruce Lee are factors but when Ip Man isn�۪t fighting he transforms into one of Mr. Wong�۪s philosophers of the heart one whose life is filled with inchoate longing poetic observations and complicated women." sometimes called Yip Man was born as Ip Kai Man or Yip Kai Man. Mr. Wong makes him 40 when the movie opens in China 1936 and while the historical figure would have been somewhat older it sounds better when in voice-over Mr. Leung explains that if life has four seasons his first 40 years were spring. Ip Man practices a style of kung fu called wing chun which is often translated as ���beautiful spring.�۝ In the film his metaphoric season begins with him being called on to demonstrate his style for Gong Baosen (Wang Qingxiang) a grandmaster visiting from the Japanese-controlled north. Having decided to retire Gong has arrived in Foshan in the south for a celebration and an exhibition of the local kung fu talent. His truer intention may be to find the worthiest martial arts successor." a division that however entertainingly illustrated in a series of fights carries unmistakable urgency because of the Japanese occupation the coming war and more obliquely the fissures of the 1949 Communist Revolution. ���The Grandmaster�۝ remains rooted in one man�۪s experiences but it�۪s also unmistakably a portrait of his country. You don�۪t learn the names of Ip Man�۪s children yet you do learn those of his martial arts adversaries the good bad and ugly who stand in for a divided China. His personal life meanwhile remains an exquisite abstraction ��� close-ups of his mournful wife scenes of domestic bliss and of horror ��� with none of the visceral realism of his fights." and thoroughly sublime. Choreographed by the action maestro Yuen Wo Ping each has a different cadence inflection and purpose and like the numbers in a musical drive the story or bring it to an enchanted standstill. In one fight Ip Man clashes with a brothel denizen wearing the tiny shoes of a woman with bound feet. Ginger Rogers only had to dance backward in heels. In another he uses metal chopsticks to ward off a razor. His greatest opponent will be the old grandmaster�۪s daughter Gong Er (Ziyi Zhang) a heartbreaking beauty who makes a loud entrance in Western-style shoes. Once she slips into traditional dress she flutters into the air like a butterfly her body arcing against Ip Man�۪s in an erotic pantomime of yin and yang." as in Mr. Wong�۪s earlier films his sumptuous excesses ��� the lush music the opulent rooms the seductive drift the thundering blows ��� both help tell the story and offer something more. When for instance Ip Man sits motionless while everyone rushes around him in fast motion as if he and they were living in different time signatures it�۪s an expression of radical isolation that�۪s so vivid it lingers after the scene ends. Through these different obviously artificial speed settings Mr. Wong isn�۪t simply showing you a man alone or a memorable picture of loneliness; he is also suggesting that this is what the experience of isolation feels like. Again and again in ���The Grandmaster �۝ images become feelings which become a bridge to this distant world." including at festivals. Explanatory text has been added and some chronology ironed out which may shed light on a few of the more lurching transitions. Although these changes are said to have been approved by Mr. Wong (consent that may have more to do with contractual obligations than happy compromises) it�۪s too bad that the American distributor didn�۪t have enough faith in the audience to release the original. Even in its altered form ���The Grandmaster�۝ is one of the truly galvanizing cinematic experiences of the year and while I�۪ve seen this version twice I am eagerly looking forward to the original in all its unfettered delirium."

Daily lunch companions they often extend the nightly busman�۪s holiday of after-work beer-drinking until closing time. They snuggle up in booths and couches sometimes dozing off but more like puppies in a box than lovers in bed." they both already have lovers. Kate is dating a slightly older guy named Chris (Ron Livingston) while Luke lives with his slightly younger girlfriend Jill (Anna Kendrick). A two-couple trip to Chris�۪s family�۪s vacation house near the dunes in Michigan brings about some interesting complications as lines of romantic interest and platonic devotion become entangled and boundaries of sexual ethics are tested. There is a stolen kiss a late-night swim episodes of tactical insomnia and moments of awkward silence." in the same old kind of movie the Hollywood studios have been churning out usually in February for the past decade or so ��� the Michigan high jinks would commence a crescendo of complications leading to a predictable happy ending. But ���Drinking Buddies �۝ Joe Swanberg�۪s nimble knowing and altogether excellent new film refuses to dance to the usual tune." except that the phrase implies a structure as well as an attitude. The genre depends on tidy mathematics a calculus of desire that produces the same result every time. Mr. Swanberg a prolific investigator of the makeshift mores of the young prefers a kind of fractal geometry leaving room for contingency confusion and randomness in his search for emotional and behavioral truth. In the past his explorations have sometimes been waylaid by formal sloppiness and a leering distracting commitment to filming women without clothes. Still he has become an undisputed expert on the group activities (filmmaking among them) of post-collegiate urban white people and a pioneer of the cinematic manner that may define the current generation of 20- and 30-somethings." but ���Drinking Buddies�۝ ��� along with other recent movies by Lynn Shelton and the Duplass brothers ��� represents an advance not only toward the entertainment mainstream but also toward a more polished and confident style. ���Drinking Buddies�۝ follows the eddies and digressions of everyday life. Mr. Swanberg�۪s camera weaves through bodies at rest at work and at the bar in no particular hurry and his script captures the idioms of men and women who are equally inclined to waste words and to say very little. But the busy tedium of their lives is given shape and direction by the skill of the cast and by the precision of the director�۪s eye ear and editing instincts." playing a fully bearded variation on his gruff needy ���New Girl�۝ character. Ms. Kendrick beautifully conveys Jill�۪s anxiety as she tries to reconcile her own needs with the unspoken imperatives to keep everything happy and casual. When she and Luke talk about getting married their negotiations are pitch-perfect meta-conversations ��� they talk about someday talking about the things they claim not to be talking about at all ��� delivering the insight that passive-aggression is nowadays less a personal trait than a cultural norm." slightly manic energy that keeps the story going. Kate is constantly in motion navigating an otherwise all-male workplace with easy one-of-the-guys humor and zipping from the bar to Chris�۪s apartment on her bicycle. In an early scene Chris who always seems to be brooding about something interrupts their foreplay with a gift: a copy of John Updike�۪s ���Rabbit Run �۝ whose wayward impulsive hero he says reminds him of Kate. This is a fascinating and unlikely idea since Rabbit Angstrom has been for generations of readers the very embodiment of entitled male narcissism. Is Chris just taking a weird literary swipe at Kate or has he glimpsed a truth about gender relations in a post-Updike world?" though ���Drinking Buddies�۝ proposes a corrective to the Updikean assumption that sexual intercourse is the ground and horizon of modern male-female relations.

This film directed by Renny Harlin (���Die Hard 2�۝) relies on a model with much less verisimilitude: ���Scooby-Doo.�۝ It openly nods to that cartoon franchise and has the same character types: the smart sleuth the athletic lunkhead the weirdo and the babe.

five British teenagers attempted a heroic pub crawl in the town of Newton Haven a feat of herculean imbibing known as the Golden Mile. Along the way there were vomiting fighting and drunken sex but amid all that fun the group failed to make it through the requisite 12 watering holes the last of which was called the World�۪s End. Their second try more than 20 years later is the subject of Edgar Wright�۪s new movie." one of them (Martin Freeman) a famous Hobbit and two of them (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) mainstays of the previous installments of Mr. Wright�۪s Cornetto Trilogy. ���The World�۪s End�۝ completes a cycle begun with ���Shaun of the Dead�۝ and continued in ���Hot Fuzz�۝ that blends genre parody snappy verbal humor and sublimely preposterous action-movie mayhem." at first this movie seems to have other things on its mind. It effectively masquerades for almost half its running time as a rueful fast-moving comedy of middle-aged resignation and rebellion. Four of the five Golden Milers have traded in the wildness of youth for the respectable trappings of adulthood with wives and ex-wives (mostly unseen) jobs (briefly visited) and sensible daily routines. The exception is Gary (Mr. Pegg) who drives the same car and wears the same clothes he did as a younger man and shows the same maniacal devotion to alcohol drug use and versatile Anglo-Saxon idioms." objectively more than a little sad. Gary is not only yet another big-screen case study in male arrested development but also it seems a genuinely damaged soul with decades of failure bad debts and fruitless rehab stints etched into his face. His pals are not too happy when he shows up to drag them back to Newton Haven but he sweet-talks guilt-trips and otherwise manipulates them into joining him. Like most such friends he is charming as well as exasperating and a catalyst for good times even as he is a constant source of worry." Peter (Eddie Marsan) Oliver (Mr. Freeman) and Andy (Mr. Frost) ��� are dull ciphers of sober living. Each has his own store of foibles and resentments and each is funny in his own way. Hanging out with the group as it reignites old bonds and grudges is a mellow pleasure and if that were all ���The World�۪s End�۝ had to offer it might be a Gen-X version of Fred Schepisi�۪s ���Last Orders �۝ a lovely and poignant meditation on the passage of time and the drinking of beer." and also Rosamund Pike as Oliver�۪s sister Sam an old flame of both Gary�۪s and Steven�۪s. I honestly don�۪t want to say too much about the robots because their arrival sends ���The World�۪s End�۝ spinning into an absurdity that must be experienced fresh. But Ms. Pike whose presence at first seems structurally analogous to Emma Watson�۪s role in ���This Is the End�۝ ��� that is the token woman in a naughty man-child comedy ��� deserves commendation for her quick wit and robot-fighting skills." but they are also metaphors as such creations tend to be. They symbolize the threat of uniformity dullness and predictability the clean and responsible approach to life and to movies that ���The World�۪s End�۝ protests with every atom of its being." in some ways plays it safe steering clear of anything too ugly or shocking as he keeps all forms of seriousness at bay. His project is childish fun with adult language and grown-up costumes and he executes it with energy and precision. The Cornetto Trilogy is named after a popular ice cream treat and the buzz of ���The World�۪s End�۝ is more like an antic sugar high than a reeling drunken stupor. There are no headaches dry mouth or crushing shame at the end ��� no ���Hangover �۝ in other words. I�۪ll drink to that." smoking swearing."

But Mr. Siegel�۪s entry dwells on Mr. Ali�۪s embrace of Islam and specifically the Nation of Islam and how his stance on the war led him out of the ring and all the way to the Supreme Court." ���The Trials of Muhammad Ali�۝ is partly a story of a man who spoke his mind and broke America�۪s polite and not-so-polite contracts regarding celebrity and race. The opening clip shows a grandstanding television producer calling Mr. Ali a ���simplistic fool �۝ and it�۪s the kind of invective that betrays an underlying anxiety: Precisely how Mr. Ali did what he did was often hard to simplify as foolhardy or even to understand and therefore posed a threat." showcasing fresh interviews with Louis Farrakhan and followers of the Nation of Islam. They include one representative describing Christianity as ���widely interpreted�۝ to be a ���slave-making�۝ religion. Mr. Siegel lets these and other sentiments illustrate Mr. Ali�۪s context and what must have been unsettling about his actions. (Mr. Siegel co-directed ���The Weather Underground �۝ a 2003 film about the group that advocated the violent overthrow of the United States government.)" ���The Trials of Muhammad Ali�۝ succumbs to the looming danger of hero worship by its end when Mr. Ali�۪s daughter appears and his continuing trial Parkinson�۪s is addressed. Before then Mr. Siegel has received invaluable help from a range of personalities: the fighter�۪s second wife (and seemingly one of his greatest challengers) Khalilah Camacho-Ali; the journalist Robert Lipsyte (formerly of The New York Times); Mr. Ali�۪s loyal brother Rahman; and a clerk from the Supreme Court proceedings who reveals behind-the-gavel details." who like many outspoken individuals can stubbornly repel scrutiny nor will it pacify the many who opposed his conscientious objections. But it also underlines one enduring quality: namely that he probably couldn�۪t care less what people think."

These aren�۪t like the strays who anxiously drift through other contemporary American movies ��� whose lack of purpose is reflected both in the groping camerawork and the uncertainty of a budding filmmaker behind the camera. The young director of ���Short Term 12 �۝ Destin Daniel Cretton may have adapted some of the techniques of low-budget independent features including a suggestion of tentativeness in the hand-held cinematography. But he�۪s clearly thought through his choices and found a subject that has earned its heartache." amid a warren of small concrete-brick rooms workers like Grace (a terrific completely persuasive Brie Larson) and her live-in lover Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) clock in to watch teenagers like Marcus (Keith Stanfield lovely) who�۪s about to turn 18 and is scared of what comes next.

It�۪s that kind of place ��� one in which doors remain open so that kids don�۪t slash their wrists ��� that kind of setup. The workers swap funny war stories to ease the tension (theirs and yours) but wittingly or not Mr. Cretton has stacked the emotional deck high." with images and scenes that no matter how transparently considered feel as if they had been caught on the fly. (Particularly instrumental in achieving this uninflected realism are locations that look like life and the complementary work of the director of photography Brett Pawlak and editor Nat Sanders.) Some of the adolescents have parents who stop by for a visit or an outing while others appear to have been permanently abandoned. Many Grace explains to a new wide-eyed worker Nate (Rami Malek) have been there for years (they�۪ve passed their shelf life). And so they live at the home waiting watching television picking fights and submitting to the tender care of workers who aren�۪t that much older than they are." quietly peeking into rooms and lives.

But the man at the center of the story Ward Allen (Jim Caviezel) turns out to be something less than that. He�۪s an interesting fellow but not particularly larger than life at least as portrayed here." one that found him constantly in front of a judge (Hal Holbrook) and regaling courtroom spectators with denunciations of hunting restrictions. It also found him too often drunk a point of tension with his high-society wife (Jaimie Alexander)." and the film directed by Annette Haywood-Carter is told in flashback through Moultrie�۪s recollections. We also occasionally are given snippets of Allen�۪s writings among them phrases like ���If we succeed in remaking wildness into mildness then we will begin to diminish.�۝" and the story becomes one of personal loss rather than epic adventure. We also don�۪t learn much about how the bond between Allen and his black friend was formed or see it evolve. So the film�۪s tale ends up being less rich than its lovely Georgia settings."

Depending on your point of view he is either a fiendish misanthrope inviting us to chortle about what fools these mortals be or a radical truth teller challenging us to remove our blinders and accept that we are essentially as crazy as his characters are." the protagonist of the first part ���Paradise: Love �۝ is Anna Maria�۪s sister. An obese homely sex tourist she travels to Kenya to pleasure herself with impoverished local beach boys in exchange for money. One of the nastier jokes is that all the cash in the world can�۪t sexually arouse her prey because Teresa and her lustful gal pals are so unattractive. And the scrawny impoverished teenagers who woo them with cheap sweet talk are hardly the strapping studs of pornographic fantasy. That movie is an excruciatingly unsettling study of exploitation and avarice that comes to nothing." but less satisfying because its disgust outweighs its compassion. Instead of erotic love the object of Anna Maria�۪s desire is Jesus. Religious extremism is a much easier satirical target than sex and Mr. Seidl can�۪t disguise his loathing of religion." please accept my sacrifice today for the grave sin of unchastity. So many people are obsessed with sex. Free them from their hell.�۝ Stripping to the waist and falling to her knees she ritually flagellates herself. Later in the movie she masturbates with the same crucifix." you might assume that Anna Maria with her hair tied in a bun is a spinster. Even after Nabil settles in the movie offers no history of their relationship beyond indicating that they haven�۪t seen each other for two years and that in the interim Anna Maria adopted her self-punishing form of Christianity." they are waging a personal religious war of words in which neither listens to the other. When Anna Maria refuses to have sex Nabil reviles her as a slut and a whore and pulls down the religious images plastered everywhere. In retaliation she stows his wheelchair in a garage and forces him to drag himself along the floor. In the ugliest scene he rolls on top of her and desperately futilely tries to force sex on her." Anna Maria commutes to Vienna to do grass-roots missionary work.

as F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote sometimes nowhere more so than in French movies. In the United States a Viking stove in the kitchen and a BMW in the driveway may be mere background noise in a sleek thriller; in France such emblems of class privilege can be grounds for a date with the Widow (a k a the guillotine) metaphorically speaking. In ���Th̩r̬se �۝ a 1920s woman is driven to commit a terrible crime for all sorts of nominal reasons though in truth her paramount motive is the accident of her birth: she�۪s bourgeois." a 15-year-old basking in the sun and her friendship with Anne. The southwest countryside is as appealing as the girls who part ways after Anne says that everyone knows her brother will marry Th̩r̬se. Six years later and Th̩r̬se is now played by Audrey Tautou wearing a knit cloche and a dour expression and walking with Anne�۪s brother Bernard (Gilles Lellouche) a solid citizen with a manicured mustache and gift for the self-satisfied obvious. When he takes Th̩r̬se�۪s face in his hands it looks as if he could crush her and so he does or at least that�۪s what the director Claude Miller would have you believe. (This was Mr. Miller�۪s last movie; he died in 2012.)" a pine forest that when joined with that of Th̩r̬se�۪s family will increase the wealth of both. Her appeal is substantially more elusive partly because Ms. Tautou maintains the same sour look for much of the movie her mouth tightly knotted. This is a marriage of property not passion and on their honeymoon Bernard proves a mechanical lover while she plays dead rising from her conjugal coma only when Anne (Ana��s Demoustier) shares that she has taken a lover. He�۪s a local Jean Azevedo (Stanley Weber) who doesn�۪t have a mustache but whose machinery is far better oiled than Bernard�۪s. He also looks nice with his shirt unbuttoned name-drops Andr̩ Gide and is Jewish a non-non in this provincial land." a metaphor that Mr. Miller gives a vigorous workout with cartons of cigarettes extinguished matches and finally an apocalyptic conflagration. In ���Th̩r̬se �۝ forests burn because the hypocrites who own them can�۪t. That�۪s the idea anyway although Mr. Miller�۪s stolid approach ��� with its waxwork figures postcard beauty insistent tastefulness and glaze of politesse ��� feels far too comfortably of this world to mount a critique of it. For her part Ms. Tautou delivers a dreary ruinously one-note performance that like Mr. Lellouche�۪s natural appeal further undercuts the story. Th̩r̬se doesn�۪t need to elicit pity to be an interesting character but if she doesn�۪t stir the imagination the actress must." the movie is adapted from ���Th̩r̬se Desqueyroux �۝ a 1927 novel by Fran̤ois Mauriac who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1952. Its admirers included the young Simone de Beauvoir who wrote in her diaries: ���I understand Mauriac�۪s Th̩r̬se Desqueyroux really well! Really well!�۝ Those exclamation points are charming and enviable because nothing in the film inspires such enthusiasm. Beauvoir�۪s next observation is vividly alive: ���Any deed will do to destroy the odious familiarity of daily life.�۝ In one sentence she zeros in on the repression that shapes the unhappy world of this story suggesting its violence and the violence it incites.

After a stormy catching-up session Carter restarts his vehicle which promptly breaks down for real." �۝ directed by the brothers Kevin and Michael Goetz from a screenplay by Kyle Killen is an awkward long-winded mash-up of therapy session horror movie and survival tale with pretensions of psychological depth. Once the two friends find themselves helpless and desperate the movie plays familiar teasing tricks signaling imminent rescue then pulling the rug out at the last second." Mitchell confesses that he has always wanted a mohawk which Carter insists on giving him. But Mitchell�۪s Travis Bickle look scares away the one driver who might have stopped to help. Any hopes of hiking to the nearest town are stymied by Mitchell�۪s inability to walk without crutches because of an unexplained injury." but his character ��� a shallow faithless smoothie chafing at his grown-up responsibilities and sexual boredom with his new wife ��� is a clich̩.

Paul (Niels Arestrup) is a portly leonine winemaker with a mane of yellowish-white hair and a blue-eyed glare of disdain that he directs like a laser at his nervous desperate-to-please only son. Paul is convinced that Martin although a competent administrator has no nose for wine. He blames his wife�۪s death four years after Martin�۪s premature birth on the strain of bringing up a child Paul cruelly describes as a puny stuttering weakling who barely survived." who lives on the vineyard in a separate house with his fiercely protective wife Alice (Anne Marivin) is presentable and hard-working but he is not a star like his father." the estate�۪s manager learns he has pancreatic cancer and is given six months to live.

�۝ ���Precious�۝ or heaven knows ���The Paperboy�۝ would mistake Lee Daniels for a realist. Nonetheless his new film ��� released as a result of a ridiculous film industry food fight with the ungainly official title ���Lee Daniels�۪ The Butler�۝ ��� is a brilliantly truthful movie on a subject that is usually shrouded in wishful thinking mythmongering and outright denial." who worked as a butler in the White House during eight presidential administrations Mr. Daniels has told the story of the civil rights movement in the bold colors of costume pageantry and the muted tones of domestic drama. He also throws in a few bright splashes of crazy over-the-top theatricality in the form of outrageous period-appropriate outfits and startling celebrity cameos as well as dabs of raucous comedy. You may hear it said in praise of ���The Butler �۝ that it shows this director in a more restrained responsible frame of mind than his earlier films did. This may be true ��� most movies not directed by John Waters can be described as more restrained than ���The Paperboy�۝ ��� but it misses both the subtlety of Mr. Daniels�۪s previous movies and the wild exuberance of this one." and of efforts to overcome it is usually addressed by Hollywood with a solemn anxious churchly hush and flattened into a tableau of villains and saints. Mr. Daniels and the screenwriter Danny Strong understand that both the horror and the heroism are connected with everything else that makes America such a complicated interesting appalling and glorious place: our politics our popular culture our deepest desires and our simplest habits. Making the topic safe and boring is no good for anyone." protest and reform did not just happen on the abstract plane of activism and politics but also in the lives of ordinary families who were always doing more than just suffering and struggling. The genius of ���The Butler�۝ lies in the sly and self-assured way it connects public affairs to private experience. Early on Cecil Gaines the character loosely based on Mr. Allen is taught that he like every other African-American who wants to survive in a white-dominated world must have two faces. This practical advice is an echo of W. E. B. Du Bois�۪s idea articulated in ���The Souls of Black Folk �۝ of the ���double consciousness�۝ at the heart of the black experience in America. ���We wear the mask that grins and lies�۝ is how the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar bitterly summarized the duplicity imposed by post-Civil War white supremacy on its emancipated but disenfranchised victims." Cecil living on a Georgia cotton farm is exposed to the most brutal manifestations of Jim Crow in scenes whose blunt shock lingers over the film�۪s gentler funnier moments. The sight of lynched bodies swinging in front of an American flag and the terrible fates of Cecil�۪s parents (David Banner and Mariah Carey) imprint themselves on him and on the audience. Forest Whitaker who plays Cecil as an adult wears his own face as an impassive benign mask gazing kindly and patiently at employers who cannot fathom the pain behind it." but altering the chronology allows Mr. Daniels and Mr. Strong to match Cecil�۪s career with the rise of the civil rights movement. Just as Cecil takes up his new job Dwight D. Eisenhower (yes that really is Robin Williams) is debating whether to send federal troops to Little Rock Ark. to desegregate the public schools. Ike�۪s successors played with sketch-comedy verve by other familiar performers will find themselves in similar predicaments as sit-ins freedom rides and voter registration drives in the South are met with tear gas attack dogs and firebombs." �۝ unlike almost every other movie about race in America is not primarily about the moral awakening of white people. Nor does it neatly divide whites into snarling bigots and paragons of tolerance. There are certainly instances of raw prejudice and of sincere decency but the presidents are complex and contradictory creatures. Lyndon B. Johnson (Liev Schreiber) spews racial slurs even as he prepares to sign the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Lincoln. Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman) treats the black White House staff more fairly than any of his predecessors ��� his wife Nancy (yes that is Jane Fonda) invites Cecil to a state dinner ��� but fails to grasp the moral enormity of South African apartheid. They all appreciate Cecil�۪s service without ever quite seeing him fully as a person. ���The room should feel empty when you�۪re in it �۝ he is told by supervisors and he becomes adept at disappearing in plain sight." whose job involves a lot of performance is a fiercely disciplined actor and the same can be said of Mr. Whitaker who demonstrates how gracefully his character walks the line between dignity and servility. But Cecil�۪s working life as an invisible man in the highest precincts of power is only one layer of this film. It is also interested in showing his other face. And so the camera follows him into the kitchens and back rooms of the White House and revels in his easy irreverent camaraderie with Carter Wilson (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and James Holloway (Lenny Kravitz) fellow butlers who become his close friends." a milieu that Mr. Daniels depicts with a warm specificity that recalls the short fiction of Edward P. Jones. The cartoonish pomp of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is a world away from the home where Cecil and his wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) raise their two sons Louis (David Oyelowo) and Charlie (Elijah Kelley). Inside the family�۪s modest gracious house the film relaxes and slows down and Mr. Daniels reveals himself once again to be singularly adept at capturing the informal rhythms of leisure. (Ms. Winfrey meanwhile demonstrates that in addition to being the most famous and powerful woman in the world she is a fine character actor.)" funny classroom scenes in ���Precious�۝ balanced that movie�۪s operatic flights of social dysfunction and the evenings at the Gaineses�۪ place ��� often attended by friends played by Terrence Howard and Adriane Lenox speaking of fine character actors ��� serve a similar function here. History is recorded in the workings of power and the challenge of social movements but it is lived by people who spend their spare time telling jokes making love getting drunk and wearing clothes that future generations will regard with envy and embarrassment. To rush through such moments would be to rob the movie of meaning as well as pleasure so Mr. Daniels slows down and lets the characters breathe." he sends them spinning breathlessly through the turmoil of the times. The movie�۪s dramatic engine is the difficult relationship between Cecil and Louis his older son who comes to resent his father�۪s cautious accommodation to the status quo. Louis who attends Fisk University becomes a kind of Zelig of �۪60s racial politics. Often in the company of his classmate and sometime girlfriend Carol (Yaya Alafia) he sits at a segregated Woolworth�۪s lunch counter on a bus full of Freedom Riders in the Lorraine Motel on the day of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.�۪s assassination and in a Black Panther strategy session in Oakland. Louis�۪s presence in all those places (and a few more besides) is meant to be symbolic rather than literal ��� ���The Butler�۝ is in every way more of a fable than a biopic ��� but the anxiety and anger that his actions provoke in Cecil are entirely believable." their story is a chronicle of the generational misunderstanding that has occurred in upwardly mobile families of every background especially in the baby boom era when educated and restless young people turned against the parents who had sacrificed so much on their behalf. The Italian-American family in David Chase�۪s ���Not Fade Away�۝ is in similar crisis. But Cecil�۪s job and the rapid changes in the South and elsewhere add an acute and painful political dimension to their antagonism." and to look with skepticism at each�۪s point of view. Louis can be courageous and principled but when his radicalism turns foolish the film does not hesitate to take his father�۪s side. Cecil on the other hand is blind to the intensity of his son�۪s convictions and the necessity of the work his son is doing and his proud patriarchal stubbornness hurts everyone in the family." in the end are doing the same work: they are insisting that their country at long last recognize them as full citizens and human beings. Mr. Daniels measures how much of this work has been accomplished at what cost and with what enemies and allies and never lets us suppose that it is finished. He dedicates ���The Butler�۝ to ���the heroes of the civil rights movement�۝ and leaves no doubt that people like the title character ��� including the unsung maids Pullman porters janitors and kitchen workers who toiled far from the White House ��� belong in that category. We remember those who marched and who stood up for themselves in the face of injustice. It is good to remember that to paraphrase Milton they also stand who only wait and serve." including racial slurs and some violent scenes."

�۝ the even more witless mirthless follow-up to ���Kick-Ass.�۝ Like the first movie this one involves nerds who dress up as superheroes to fight crime. This setup once could have been read as an allegory for the tribulations endured by the presumptive audience for the comic-book series from which the movies sprang. These days though no Frank Miller fans walk their school halls fearfully clutching ���Batman: Year One�۝ while waiting for the next wedgie: They fly their freak flag proudly all the way to Comic-Con. The meek have already inherited the earth or at least the culture industry�۪s attention." none of the major studios were interested in bankrolling the first movie which was distributed by Lionsgate. (That company has carved out a niche with movies about lethal children like the ���Twilight�۝ series ���The Hunger Games�۝ and the forthcoming ���Ender�۪s Game.�۝) Universal Pictures by contrast is releasing ���Kick-Ass 2.�۝ Another sign of change is that ���Kick-Ass�۝ stirred up objections over the casting of Chlo�� Grace Moretz who was 11 when she took on the role of the gun-toting Hit Girl. By the time the movie was out she was 13 and the outrage had subsided perhaps because not many people were interested in paying to see it. But while��one of her co-stars this time Jim Carrey has distanced himself from the new movie that�۪s it for controversy." but also because it�۪s the kind of cynical product that gives violent movies a bad name. There�۪s no story to speak of just a familiar title recycled characters and carnage. Hit Girl is now in high school where she comes up against mean girls; meanwhile her friend Dave (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) wants to suit up again as the titular character. That�۪s it along with violence that skews more realistic than cartoonish like a scene in which an Asian man has his genitals chewed by a German shepherd and another of a butched-up woman who�۪s fatally pierced including in her pneumatic breasts by jagged pieces of glass. The nature of her death isn�۪t inadvertent; it�۪s clear she�۪s receiving the penetrating punishment she had coming." Jeff Wadlow can�۪t obscure the movie�۪s misogyny and he also has a tough time staging a scene and selling a joke. His worst offense is that he has no understanding of the power gravity and terrible beauty of violent imagery which means he has no grasp of cinema. When Hit Girl a k a Mindy kills a thief it�۪s with the glazed indifference that lets you know that nothing matters not the man bleeding out at her feet not Dave�۪s fleeting shock and certainly not her humanity. The moment is empty and so is she. Even so you may still shiver in repugnance at the scene in which a number of New York cops are slaughtered for giggles. You may also wonder who at Universal signed off on a flick in which human beings are as disposable as tissues and teenagers shoot to kill." the sequel tries to use extremes including caricatures to generate woozy comedy. And the image of the tiny Ms. Moretz executing flips and villains in the first movie did give it an uncomfortably comic bite as did Mindy�۪s slavish devotion to her psychotic father a self-styled superhero called Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). He�۪s gone now as is the modest frisson generated by his relationship with Hit Girl. Now Mindy is just another kid with only one real friend no real parenting problems at school a carefully nurtured secret life and a roomful of lethal weapons. In other words while she�۪s still a fictional character and a moderately cartoonish one at that she�۪s also a heroic stand-in for every teenager who picks up a gun and starts shooting."

There are good bad happy sad times mostly with guys (women barely register) though it all gets heavier after Steve starts driving a Porsche and shacks up in a mansion with only an Einstein poster for company a trajectory echoed in the soundtrack: ���Life�۪s Been Good �۝ ���Roll With the Changes �۝ ���You Can Do (Whatever).�۝" the movie is bookended by scenes of the middle-aged Jobs doing what some believed he did best: pitching new products. Fuzzed up and hunched over Mr. Kutcher looks somewhat like the young Jobs and there are moments ��� as when he gives another character a small devious look as if sliding in a knife ��� that the casting seems more than a matter of bottom-line calculation. But Mr. Kutcher doesn�۪t have the tools that some actors use to transcend weak material and either he didn�۪t receive any help or didn�۪t allow any real direction from Mr. Stern. Mr. Kutcher�۪s tendency to cap so many emotional scenes with small self-satisfied smiles is especially unfortunate because they can�۪t help but bring to mind his other career as a pitchman for digital cameras." who never find a way to navigate the ���passions perfectionism demons desires artistry devilry and obsession for control�۝ that Walter Isaacson enumerated in ���Steve Jobs �۝ his 2011 authorized biography. Mr. Stern and Mr. Whiteley pile up Jobs�۪s multitudes: he screams and smirks the score rises triumphantly only to ease and darken. Other characters announce to Steve and one another that he�۪s changed. But how and why? There are nods at his adoption and the daughter he initially refused to acknowledge but those never amount to much and after a while you don�۪t care. The Great Man theory of history that�۪s recycled in this movie is inevitably unsatisfying but never more so when the figure at the center remains as opaque as Jobs does here."

An older fellow says ���howdy.�۝ What other state could it be?" western-ish crime drama written and directed by David Lowery is a bit harder to place though the shape of the cars and a briefly glimpsed television set suggest the late 1960s or early 1970s. Not that it matters much. We could just as easily be in the 1870s or the 1930s since the themes of violence honor and sacrifice are as unchanging as the big cloud-swept sky.

These are decidedly not the angles Mr. Lowery chooses. Instead the wonder-of-nature cinematography (by Bradford Young) and the fluid editing betray a heavy debt to the work of Terrence Malick though with little of Mr. Malick�۪s intellectual gravity or visionary ambition." which always depend on overt and invisible artifice.

He meets Travis who is newly sprung after years in prison and takes him under his wing. The slightly bewildered new ex-con sees freedom stretched out before him and immediately worries that he�۪ll blow his chances." in a way made for each other in the cinema of redemption at least but Mr. Hartigan who also wrote the plain-spoken screenplay makes their encounter in ���This Is Martin Bonner�۝ a matter of friendship rather than thematic convenience. Alone and divorced Martin (the Australian-born actor Paul Eenhoorn) is an unassuming middle-aged man whose daughter one long-distance call at a time nudges him into dating partly to get him to leave his spare apartment a bit." Travis (Richmond Arquette) has trouble settling in with an extremely nice and religious host family and looks to Martin when he needs help facing a daughter he hasn�۪t seen for years." he looks wide-eyed at what comes next humbled by time served. Mr. Eenhoorn (whose patient expressions here suggest a kindly priest) gives his character the shy charm of palpable decency. Nearly upstaging both underplayed performances is some camerawork that bestows an oddly formal quality on certain scenes of solitude and poised bursts of instrumental music feel like grabs for grace." but at another point a scan of Martin�۪s apartment is so evenly executed as to attract attention to itself instead of underlining the ordinary bachelor digs." �۝ and the opening scene showing Martin counseling a hard-bargaining prisoner signals the director�۪s restraint early on drawing the curtain on another kind of story. It�۪s gratifying to see the care taken with his characters though it would be no betrayal of them for Mr. Hartigan to flesh out their world and their lives further."

They�۪re simply two people inside an austere room. Yet as bombs shake the walls and she places a bloodied compress on his head they are quickly transformed into a time-tested outwardly reassuring vision of a woman heroically ministering to a wounded possibly dying man." Atiq Rahimi an Afghan who�۪s been living in France since the mid-1980s soon deconstructs in this adaptation of his 2008 novel of the same title. Written with the veteran screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri̬re (who has collaborated with Luis Bu̱uel and Jean-Luc Godard) the movie has an elegant initially attractive simplicity. Once the bombs stop if temporarily the woman begins to speak leaning over her apparently comatose husband and asking ���Can you hear me?�۝ It isn�۪t a simple question even in most close relationships. Here while it reveals the woman�۪s uncertainty about her husband�۪s condition ��� he remains almost completely motionless though at times his eyes are disconcertingly open ��� the question also conveys her enforced existential silence as an Afghan wife." filling the silence with whispered fears surprisingly few sobs an occasional punctuating cry of alarm and increasingly long-nurtured resentments. Abandoned by her in-laws who have fled this unspecified war ��� the only fighters we see are Afghans ��� the woman has been forced to care for her husband and their two young daughters on her own. The money appears to have run out along with her relatives and options. The local pharmacist refuses to give her more medicine because she owes too much money and even the water-delivery man has stopped coming. A few neighbors hover about cowering with her and the children in a basement when the bombs fall too close but otherwise she�۪s alone." filling its few rooms with enough air sharp words and slow-boiling intrigue that the walls never feel as if they�۪re closing in on you. The near-constant dialogue keeps things moving even when the characters remain still as does a camera that repeatedly focuses on some new detail ��� a view from a window a man�۪s portrait on a wall ��� that adds information to the evolving tale. Every so often both the camera and the woman venture outdoors wandering into the forlorn dusty streets among the ruined homes and emaciated dogs. After several failed tries she at last arrives at her aunt�۪s home where the story begins taking a turn for the melodramatic. (The movie was largely made in Morocco with exteriors shot in Afghanistan.)" ���The Patience Stone�۝ mirrors an Afghan myth (���The 70-Year-Old Corpse�۝) that appears in the book ���Folktales Told Around the World.�۝ The book�۪s editor the folklorist Richard M. Dorson explained that the story ��� which involves a young woman being given to an old man in an arranged marriage ��� had been told by women ���as a healthy expression of their stifled feelings in a male-dominated world.�۝ That pretty much distills the fictionalized world represented in ���The Patience Stone �۝ although Mr. Rahimi takes a rather more poetic approach to the same subject using universals (Man and Woman) as proxies in a battle that as the story progresses takes on an abstract quality. Yet while there may be truths in some universals it�۪s hard to forget that this tale has its roots in a bitterly real world."

He died of a subdural hematoma leaving behind a pregnant fianc̩e. But the film beautifully shot by Ian Kerr (who evokes the era with photographs yellowed newspaper clips and fight footage) peels back fresh layers that will captivate nonfans too." the documentary ��� at times veering close to a hagiographic portrait ��� is also about Mr. Mancini�۪s hometown Youngstown Ohio; the transcending power of father-son bonds; the unwavering determination of two boxers; and inadvertently the male fascination with this brutal sport. While Mr. Mancini mesmerizingly guides us to his present Mr. Kriegel friends like the actor Ed O�۪Neill and others advance the story of his past." though and there�۪s hardly enough time for a comprehensive accounting of its toll. (How has Mr. Mancini managed to cope and maintain a livelihood all these years?) Mr. Kim remains a sort of mythic figure and his story (he grew up poor before finding an outlet for his rage in the ring and redemption in love) feels too condensed. The imbalance is most evident during the emotional meeting of Mr. Mancini and Mr. Kim�۪s adult son Jiwan. They find closure and we feel for them but it also seems forced."

Behind it is a room full of curious exotic objects an eccentric private museum that makes her smile in almost childlike wonder." even if it is quite funny (though maybe not to Carol whose nose is nearly swallowed by the man trying to kiss her). But that moment of escaping from the crowd and finding a surprise ��� the way Carol�۪s curiosity is indulged and briefly rewarded ��� is typical of Lake Bell�۪s smart generous and altogether winning debut feature ���In a World ....�۝ Ms. Bell who plays Carol with a perfect blend of diffidence goofiness and charm has written and directed an insightful comedy that is much more complex and ambitious than it sometimes seems." a kind and quick-witted 30-year-old woman who often comes across as a self-involved underachiever the movie can fool you with its unassuming visual style and rambling narrative. In some ways a late bloomer�۪s coming-of-age story (like so many screen comedies in the recessionary Age of Apatow) it is also in no particular order a show-business satire a family drama a feminist parable and a sweet romantic comedy. Not that any of these labels can do justice to the originality of Ms. Bell�۪s creative voice." as it happens is a preoccupation that she and Carol share. Though technically a grown-up Carol still works in the shadow (and sleeps in the guest room) of her father Sam (Fred Melamed) a legendary vocal actor with a baritone so rich and loamy that soybeans might take root in his mouth. Sam is also an old-school male chauvinist with an ego as large as his belly. Both are well merited as far as he is concerned. In the world of ���In a World ... �۝ the guys who intone movie-trailer catchphrases and clich̩s form a sub-Hollywood celebrity aristocracy complete with groupies and back-stabbing rivalries masquerading as backslapping friendships. Sam even though he is about to receive a lifetime achievement award is still vain and insecure about his status." however quite certain that there is no room for his daughter or any other woman in this boys�۪ club. (And he may be right. How many times have you heard a female voice narrating a movie trailer?) Carol works as a dialect coach helping (for example) Eva Longoria master a Cockney accent and collecting unusual speech patterns with a tape recorder. Sam�۪s heir apparent is Gustav Werner (Ken Marino) a golden-tongued narcissistic cad though it should be noted that the magic room full of knickknacks does belong to him. It is a measure of Ms. Bell�۪s generous sense of human peculiarity that even her movie�۪s designated heel is shown to have an interesting side." a sound engineer whose infatuation with Carol is obvious in the classic rom-com fashion to everyone but her. There is also a scattered Greek chorus of eccentric supporting characters led by Tig Notaro and an unusually subdued (and shockingly clean-shaven) Nick Offerman." played at languorous indie speed with room for pockets of melancholy and melodrama mostly courtesy of Carol�۪s frustrated sister Dani (Michaela Watkins) and her nice-enough sad-sack husband (Rob Corddry). Carol exiled from her dad�۪s house to make room for his much-younger girlfriend (Alexandra Holden) flees to her sister�۪s couch and becomes a witness to (and an unwitting participant in) a marital crisis." when you stop to think about it. Yet it all holds together mostly because Ms. Bell has so thoroughly considered the details of Carol�۪s life and the facets of her personality. The film�۪s title is an apt description of its commitment to lightly exaggerated comically inflected realism. The people around Carol are idiosyncratic but never aggressively quirky and the milieu they inhabit ��� the less-glamorous side of the Los Angeles creative economy ��� is depicted with affection and insight." especially for the obstacles placed in the path of women who have ��� literally in this case ��� a hard time being heard in the world of movies. Ms. Bell is not the character she plays but her career as an actress is to some extent a case study in the ways the industry circumscribes female talent. In commercial comedies she has been cast as the kooky friend or the romantic patsy: She is the co-worker Ashton Kutcher dumps for Natalie Portman in ���No Strings Attached�۝; the second wife Alec Baldwin cheats on with Meryl Streep in ���It�۪s Complicated.�۝ There never seems to be quite enough for her to do. And it may be that to find a leading role worthy of her gifts Ms. Bell had to make one herself. There is every reason to be glad she did."

In 1974 when he was 17 religious and involved in a guerrilla group he stabbed a policeman for which he received a bullet to the stomach and a prison sentence." he went on to become a filmmaker and restaged the attack in his 1995 movie ���A Moment of Innocence.�۝ In that re-creation though the assault doesn�۪t end with one Iranian shooting another but with a flower and bread supplanting the gun and knife." discursive inquiry into religious belief that opens to include questions about cinema the movie is largely set within the perimeters of the astonishing Baha�۪i gardens. Holy sites for the Baha�۪i faith in the Israeli cities of Haifa and Acre (also known as Akko) the gardens serve as shrines to the Baha�۪i prophets B��b who�۪s buried on Mount Carmel in Haifa and Bah���۪u�۪ll��h who�۪s interred in Acre." affirmations that have been realized in meticulous geometric arrangements of hundreds of plants ��� including towering pines bright blooms luscious succulents and gnarled olive trees ��� and that are intersected by colored paths." dressed in dark clothes and walking on a light-colored lane that�۪s flanked by rows of red flowers and green cypresses and pierced by an elegant olive tree. He�۪s accompanied by a second man his son Maysam Makhmalbaf who wears a light-colored jacket. It�۪s a chromatically striking image that draws attention to the men and signals other more significant differences that will emerge. They�۪re lugging camera equipment that they will soon use to digitally record the garden some other visitors and each other during a dialectical exchange on religion with the elder Makhmalbaf ostensibly arguing on behalf of faith and the younger man more or less presenting the opposing view." the discussion is soothing civilized and quietly touching and because the Baha�۪i continue to be persecuted in Iran it�۪s also inherently political. Although he folds in some archival material Mr. Makhmalbaf pointedly steers clear of contemporary policies and politics and instead focuses on a few Baha�۪i believers including Ririva Eona Mabi a gardener from Papua New Guinea whose mellow words and manner ��� when he holds a pansy to the camera it�۪s as if he were cupping a child�۪s face ��� verge on the otherworldly. There�۪s also a woman an educator of some kind who�۪s seen running about with her pink shawl fluttering behind her an image that�۪s so embarrassingly goofy and so nakedly sincere that you may feel ashamed for your unkind thoughts which may be the point." who now lives in London having left Iran in 2005 after the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Even with a new president it seems unlikely that Mr. Makhmalbaf will return soon especially judging from the response in Iran to ���The Gardener �۝ apparently the first movie shot in Israel by an Iranian since the revolution." according to The Los Angeles Times Mr. Makhmalbaf traveled to the Jerusalem Film Festival with the movie prompting the head of Iran�۪s official cinema organization both to denounce him for falling ���into the arms of the occupier the murderous Zionist regime�۝ and to call on the state cinema museum to remove his awards. The visit also inspired letters of support and censure from Iranian intellectuals and others." �۝ but to separate the movie from its maker and his history would be a mistake. Mr. Makhmalbaf�۪s radical tolerance is itself an act of political defiance. Given this it�۪s worth considering that the English word ���paradise�۝ originates in the Persian one for enclosure pairidaeza." although as he rambles throughout the Baha�۪i gardens his camera inching antlike close to the ground and then soaring birdlike over the grounds he lyrically joins the spiritual with the terrestrial. By the time the movie ends he has borrowed a gardener�۪s hat and is tending a holy place that he has made clear extends far beyond these enchanted realms."

Their job is to paint the yellow lines on a rural stretch of Texas highway that has been damaged along with the surrounding forests and settlements by a wildfire.

And a change does take place in Alvin and Lance�۪s understanding of each other and in our view of them.

Instead he observes the rhythms of their labor and leisure and listens to their aimless talk allowing himself now and then to be distracted by an insect an unusual rock or an especially fascinating puddle." who might not be that much older than Lance demonstrates a pomposity beyond his years.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/movies/lovelace-about-the-star-of-deep-throat.html
�۝ a movie about the chasm between public perception and private experience pulls off a sly bait and switch. It�۪s inspired by the autobiography of one Linda Boreman who when she was young permed and under the spell of a violent pimp earned her place in hard-core history by suppressing her gag reflex in the 1972 film ���Deep Throat.�۝ With its ���Boogie Nights�۝ typeface and mustachioed dudes as slick and artificial as their Qiana threads ���Lovelace�۝ promises the down-and-dirty best (or worst) with a snigger and pulsating beats. It delivers just as promised only to do a 180 in order to tell another uglier story this one involving beatings rape and 24/7 terror." when explicit sexual entertainments are a mouse click away it can be difficult to appreciate the impact that ���Deep Throat�۝ had in the United States on its release. Released in June 1972 in a Times Square theater this hourlong dirty movie became a sensation a touchstone a disgrace providing ample fodder for snickering late-night talk shows and bloviating editorial writers alike. Norman Mailer weighed in as did Bob Hope who�۪s seen briefly in ���Lovelace�۝ joking that he thought it was about a giraffe. In The New York Review of Books the feminist Ellen Willis said it best finding the movie ���witless exploitative and about as erotic as a tonsillectomy.�۝ Then as now though few seemed interested in the actual woman on screen." poignantly melancholic) was at the height of her porn career and known as Linda Lovelace the It (or Ick) Girl for the sexual revolution. She�۪s sitting and smoking in a bubble bath and if you don�۪t look at her too closely ��� and at the time apparently few did ��� you might miss the cuts and bruises. This is the Linda that the world didn�۪t see and who even as her body became a public spectacle nursed her wounds in private. She was the queen of the dirty movies but here as this symbolic purification suggests her life would soon receive a cleansing." in a way though without the sanctimony other filmmakers might have brought to the story. Instead Mr. Epstein and Mr. Friedman whose credits together and separately include the documentary ���The Times of Harvey Milk�۝ and the fact-informed fiction ���Howl�۝ (about the times of Allen Ginsberg) have directed a movie that embraces the idea that history belongs both to those who live and those who write it and that all histories no matter how they cling to the facts are necessarily incomplete contingent interpreted and shaped into stories. The philosopher Paul Ricoeur who in his book ���Memory History Forgetting �۝ put it beautifully:" memory and forgetting." life." ���Lovelace�۝ gets its mojo going with a flashback to 1970 opening on a scene of Linda and her close and apparently only friend Patsy (Juno Temple) sunbathing in the Boreman family�۪s Florida backyard. When Patsy innocently unties Linda�۪s bikini top Linda demurs. Don�۪t be such a prude Patsy teases. In most other stories this line as well as Linda�۪s resistance might register as insignificant but here it initiates a counter-narrative that runs quietly through the first half and rises to a roar in the second. Adding foreboding piquancy as well as psychological clues is a looming oversize statue of the Virgin Mary and the weirdly twinned figure of Linda�۪s rampaging hectoring mother Dorothy Boreman (Sharon Stone simmering with dark hair and scowl)." Mr. Epstein and Mr. Friedman bring on the putative good times and vibes with narrative economy and period flair. (The real Boreman wrote several memoirs including ���Ordeal.�۝) Structurally the story they tell resembles an 18th-century tale of sexual liberation (like the Marquis de Sade�۪s novel ���Juliette�۝) that becomes a tale of exploitation (like Sade�۪s ���Justine�۝) with Boreman�۪s later marriage to Larry Marchiano her children and anti-pornography activism little more than a coda. Mostly it�۪s girl meets pimp-husband (an excellent Peter Sarsgaard as Chuck Traynor) who ushers her into the world of sexual pleasure and pornography that becomes a hell. It�۪s a story that as the porn director Candida Royalle once said of ���Ordeal �۝ has more to do with domestic abuse than pornography." yet she also wrote that it was ���at once a low point and a salvation.�۝ That�۪s a difficult complex idea and there�۪s a lot in this story about victimization and agency that Mr. Epstein and Mr. Friedman never satisfactorily address. It�۪s perhaps inevitable that they seem happier when nothing yet feels at stake including during the production of ���Deep Throat.�۝ (The excellent troika of Hank Azaria Chris Noth and Bobby Cannavale enliven the proceedings.) Once the movie flips to present Linda�۪s take on the same events it grows grim and then grimmer which may do justice to her story even as it fails to illuminate the woman who was Linda Boreman ��� a k a Linda Traynor a k a Linda Marchiano ��� a k a Linda Lovelace."

Pairing a script by Dan Mazer a writer on ���Borat�۝ and ���Br�_no �۝ with a genre more reliant on the warm and fuzzies than the cold and creepies proves disastrous (and explains the smut). And though Mr. Mazer directing his first feature laudably tries to upend a few made-for-each-other clich̩s he constantly misjudges the balance between sharp edges and soft centers. His lovers don�۪t coo they snipe." Nat (Rose Byrne) and Josh (Rafe Spall) could not be more mismatched. She�۪s a put-together advertising type; he�۪s a slovenly writer given to inane jokes and tongue-tied gurgles in the presence of attractive women. Her parents play genteel games of charades; his are unable to go five minutes without groping each other. This inappropriateness is the film�۪s crass fuel supplied most reliably by Stephen Merchant as Josh�۪s foul-mouthed best mate. And though Olivia Colman is wonderful as a bitter batty counselor and Minnie Driver�۪s tart tongue deserves a movie of its own not even they can salvage this miscalculated marriage of cynicism and sentiment." a flaccid full-frontal and embarrassingly indelicate in-laws."

resolutely fatalistic. The man who was Moses began fighting the fantasy good fight in 1968 battling damn dirty apes in ���Planet of the Apes �۝ before going on to face zombie hordes in ���Omega Man�۝ and an overpopulated nightmare in ���Soylent Green.�۝ (Psst: It�۪s people!) Heston may be gone but the zombie hordes have kept coming along with other new and unusual annihilating threats and now it�۪s back to the dystopian future with ���Elysium �۝ a cautionary shocker from the director Neill Blomkamp about a Hobbesian war of all against all from which only Matt Damon can save us." an Everyman living though often just struggling in 2154 amid the devastation known as Earth. Mr. Blomkamp knows how to set the stage and as cameras race over the wreckage like vengeful or fleeing angels taking in the digitally rendered horrors and real locations some introductory text explains the basics. Disease poverty and overpopulation ��� and from the churning dust presumably ecological ruin ��� have transformed the planet into a global ghetto. While the multicultural many crawl through the terrestrial dirt the privileged few live in the ultimate gated community a wheel-shaped space habitat Elysium that brings to mind an orbital Mercedes-Benz logo. Up close it looks like one of the costlier coastal swatches of Southern California." who made a splash with his 2009 feature debut ���District 9 �۝ has a talent for making the old and familiar seem excitingly new. As he has before he again uses real locations to suggest the impending worst with areas in Mexico City here standing in for 2154 Los Angeles. (Parts of Vancouver double for Elysium.) Pauline Kael once called Los Angeles the fantasy-brothel ���you can live any way you want (except the urban way) �۝ but for years the city has also served as a reliable nightmare more roach motel than brothel: Sure you can get in but good luck getting out. That this tends to say more about how some filmmakers see the movie industry should go without saying." the 33-year-old Mr. Blomkamp hasn�۪t been around long enough to bite the hand feeding him. And while he has a talent for visualizing the worst (apparently a big-studio directorial prerequisite these days) he brings a light touch and jokes to the ugliest proceedings. Even Max�۪s ghetto doesn�۪t seem especially awful. He may live in a home that�۪s a dump by haute Hollywood standards but it looks far better than the cardboard and corrugated-metal houses crowding the poorer regions of so many of the real world�۪s megalopolises. The mob of children who swarm him on his way to work greet him with giggles not desperation while his friend Julio (a sweet Diego Luna in fetching braids) offers camaraderie and some back story when he asks for Max�۪s help with a robbery." Max now labors in a factory that manufactures the robots that police the masses and shades of ���The Jetsons�۝ and Philip K. Dick serve the Elysium elite. That the robots appear to have it easier than the humans stuck on Earth is one of the bitter truths that Mr. Blomkamp deploys as he begins filling in the story. He�۪s better with some big-picture details: On Earth folks speak English and Spanish (Max switches between both) while on Elysium the well-heeled drop a little French in between exchanging pleasantries and exercising their privilege. The apotheosis of their Elysium entitlement and a crucial emblem of the divide between the haves and the have-nots are home-wellness machines that by rescrambling atoms eradicate disease almost instantaneously." sending him on a mission of self-preservation. ���I don�۪t want to die �۝ he says voicing the fear of extinction behind all dystopian fiction. His mission grows exponentially weightier when in an effort to cure himself he joins up with a smuggler Spider (Wagner Moura fantastic). A high-tech coyote if one still using a notebook computer Spider agrees to send Max to Elysium illegally on the condition that he steal information from the head literally of an industrialist (the dependably good William Fichtner in full slither mode). The would-be brain-jacking goes wrong sending Max deeper into trouble pushed one way by a love interest (Alice Braga) and pulled another by Elysium villains (Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley)." Mr. Damon has become the greatest utility player in movies: No one can better vault across rooftops and in and out of genres and make you care greatly if he falls. He�۪s so homespun that he could have sprung wholly formed from a corn silo (he shares James Stewart�۪s extraordinary likability if not his later-life postwar neurotic edge). But it�۪s the ease and sincerity with which Mr. Damon conveys moral decency ��� so that it feels as if it originates from deep within rather than from say God or country ��� that helps make him a strikingly contemporary ideal of what used to be regularly called the American character." �۝ a wobbly political allegory about crustaceanlike E.T.�۪s subjected to apartheid abuse in South Africa Mr. Blomkamp builds on real catastrophes to create an admonitory tale. This is one of the axiomatic constructs of science fiction which makes the familiar strange and the strange familiar whether it�۪s the dark rainy Los Angeles of Ridley Scott�۪s ���Blade Runner�۝ or a Europe that foreshadows that of World War II in H. G. Wells�۪s 1933 novel ���The Shape of Things to Come�۝ (which three years later became the film ���Things to Come�۝)." �۝ in which Wells writing amid a worldwide depression envisions a disastrously fallen Earth saved by ���an intelligent minority�۝ that abolishes warring sovereign nations in favor of a world government. However disquieting his technocratic remedy for what ailed his times Wells meets the imaginative worst with a speculative resolution. In other words he suggests an answer something that has become scarce in the ravaged landscapes of many science-fiction movies. Mr. Blomkamp�۪s rendering of Elysium as a McMansion-studded suburb is amusing (it owes much to a space haven designed in 1975 by NASA and Stanford University) but its banality is further evidence of how difficult Utopian visions even caricatures like this one have become for filmmakers to imagine." Mr. Blomkamp turns out to be much better at blowing things up than putting the shattered pieces together though this may also be a matter of box-office calculation. The beginning of ���Elysium�۝ comes on like gangbusters and at first it�۪s fun to be swept up in a movie like this riding shotgun with the swooping camera moves and feeling the dread creep in with each of the score�۪s brassy blares (harbingers of doom like those in ���Inception�۝). As the weapons start firing and the blood begins running it�۪s hard not to wonder though if it�۪s Mr. Blomkamp who couldn�۪t find a genuinely fresh exit strategy or whether as this summer�۪s screen conflagrations suggest it�۪s the big studios that have given up on Utopia."

What comes out of them isn�۪t as amusing or surprising as what came out of those cars and no matter how fast they go these planes cannot escape the gravitational pull of the earlier movies. ���Planes�۝ is for the most part content to imitate rather than innovate presumably hoping to reap a respectable fraction of the box office numbers of ���Cars�۝ and ���Cars 2 �۝ which together made hundreds of millions of dollars (not to mention the ubiquitous product tie-ins)." �۝ which played well in overseas markets. The airplane racers come from an assortment of countries and stop all over the globe. (The best gag is a reincarnation joke delivered somewhere around India.) And it has the familiar assortment of friends and foes either helping or hindering the likable hero: an old aircraft with wise advice a cutthroat one that doesn�۪t play by the rules and so on." a nod to the heroics and traumas of the World War II generation. Chug the fuel truck (Brad Garrett) and Dottie the forklift (Teri Hatcher) provide crucial support as well Dottie serving as mechanic. Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith) has won the race three times in a row and will stop at nothing to make it four." just when it seems on its way to a predictable happy ending the movie directed by Klay Hall takes a jarringly dark turn as Dusty encounters a frightening storm at sea. He�۪s flying close to the water because he�۪s afraid of heights not a good thing when the ocean is churning with ���Perfect Storm�۝-size waves." most of it involves a Mexican plane named El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui). The character is one of several in this movie that carry a whiff of ethnic stereotyping but more notable is this plane�۪s relentless wooing of a Canadian plane named Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus)." but what precisely this means is left unclear as their plane-to-plane make-out session takes place off screen. With children being naturally curious parents should prepare themselves by studying the schematics for assorted aircraft. There are bound to be some awkward questions about the birds and the bees and the flying machines."

On the train Rahul meets Meena (Ms. Padukone) the daughter of a South Indian don. The thugs he so kindly helped have kidnapped her to bring her back to Daddy and now have made him their prisoner too." the movie shifts tone dramatically if not surprisingly for Bollywood. Rahul lectures the men in Meena�۪s village about respecting women�۪s emotions. He then fights off all comers to win her and earn respect. Powered by love and lifted by violence he now can lay down the law: Be nice to women. (This hardly seems a workable civic model.)" Rohit Shetty has a playful visual sense evident from the first shot: the camera views Mr. Khan from below as if he were standing on a glass sheet before swooping up. These flourishes though often seem divorced from the material. Not so the South Indian scenery made glorious by Mr. Shetty�۪s saturated palette and showman�۪s ability to transform nature into an eye-popping stage set."

The intensity of the plea is a tug at the heart a tug that turns into a jolt with a blunt cut to four little coffins being loaded on a plane." but the story that the Belgian director Joachim Lafosse tells turns out to be anything but obvious.

There�۪s an old-fashioned patrician air about him that registers as charming one minute and overbearingly paternalistic the next. If Murielle doesn�۪t seem to mind it�۪s partly because she doesn�۪t have much of a family and like Mounir she very much wants to please Andr̩. She does in time especially when she delivers a girl. Time passes and she�۪s pregnant with a second child and then a third. Everyone gets along amid the shrieks and cluttered toys but the rooms start to shrink as does Murielle�۪s smile.

written by Bret Easton Ellis and starring Lindsay Lohan ��� is a dispiriting unpleasurable work punctuated with flashes of vitalizing vulgarity. It isn�۪t a good movie in terms of the conventional norms (acting for starters) but it also exhibits a crude integrity. If you take the characters seriously or at their word a mistake for such a dissembling venal group you may think that this is just another story about the dirty business of making movies. Hollywood types have been rolling around in the muck about as long as there�۪s been an industry (that�۪s what made Sammy run); the twist here is that no one here seems to care anymore." despite some outward affinities. Mr. Schrader is an iconoclast who�۪s long worked outside the mainstream while Mr. Ellis is a literary outsider who�۪s well known for igniting critical outrage. Mr. Schrader tends to focus on existential loners on the margins in films that touch on subjects like pornography and prostitution themes that have figured in Mr. Ellis�۪s work. But while Mr. Schrader is a deeply serious moralist who pulls you into worlds of churning emotion Mr. Ellis delivers shocks at a chilly seemingly noncommittal distance. (In a 1999 interview Mr. Schrader bemoaned that the existential hero had been supplanted by what he called the ���ironic hero�۝ ��� the guy who asks not ���should I exist?�۝ but ���who cares?�۝)" a stereotype of the city that conflates it with Hollywood and has been in circulation since the movies began.

One crucial difference is that ���Sunset Boulevard�۝ and ���Mulholland Drive�۝ each draw you in through the complex destabilizing and productive play between irony and idealism. ���The Canyons�۝ initially appears to be doing much the same as in a desultory introductory scene set at a bar-restaurant except that idealism isn�۪t anywhere on the menu." a porn star) and Tara (Ms. Lohan) a power couple first seen in a bar in the Chateau Marmont an old hotel known for its bad beautiful clientele and for being where John Belushi permanently checked out.

They�۪re having dinner with his assistant Gina (Amanda Brooks) and her boyfriend Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk) who�۪s been cast in one of Christian�۪s flicks. Christian and Tara spend more time looking at their phones than at their companions. This may signal their anomie but given the dull talk they may merely be bored." lighted and shot but it inches everything forward by mapping the characters and their relationships. (The characters regularly use one another�۪s names ��� ���Nobody has a private life anymore Tara�۝ ��� perhaps so they can remember who they�۪re talking to.) Mr. Schrader directs the actors to deliver some of their lines while facing the camera a modest breach of the fourth wall that makes it seem as if the characters are talking to the audience. A favorite critical orthodoxy one that builds on Brecht�۪s concept of the epic theater is that such breaches disrupt or break the cinematic illusion of reality thereby making ostensibly passive viewers aware of the filmmaking processes and thus the ideology behind that illusion." from the camerawork to the stilted stop-and-go dialogue can be read as a Brechtian enterprise but mostly it feels like Mr. Schrader isn�۪t in control of his material. Ms. Brooks and Mr. Nolan deliver their lines unpersuasively their sincerity bouncing off Ms. Lohan�۪s and Mr. Deen�۪s glazed personas.

Mr. Deen mostly just sneers (his default expression) while he details Christian and Tara�۪s online hookups. Waving his cellphone Christian says he makes his own movies." but more important in ���The Canyons �۝ it serves as a signifier for the death of the movies. This idea is bluntly introduced through a succession of photographs of shuttered movie theaters that both appear in the opening credits and are inserted (accompanied by time stamps: Monday Tuesday etc.) throughout creating something like chapters. The photos can�۪t help bringing to mind Peter Bogdanovich�۪s ���Last Picture Show �۝ in which the closing of a cinema in the 1950s serves as a eulogy both for a dying town and for a movie love rooted in a physical space." of course you can watch movies anywhere and ���The Canyons�۝ will be available on iTunes the day it opens in theaters. In ���The Last Picture Show �۝ Mr. Bogdanovich used the advent of television to signal the end of an era and the loss of a kind of cinematic experience. There�۪s a similar idea about death and movies swirling in ���The Canyons �۝ most obviously with the figure of Christian an avatar of both entitlement and entertainment who�۪s solely interested in making pornographic home videos not actual movies. When he waves his cell ��� that onanistic toy emblem of pathological narcissism and augury of social dissolution ��� he�۪s waving it not only at his dinner companions but also at us. It�۪s a provocative idea that�۪s soon lost amid the self-consciously deployed clich̩s that finally do the movie in." Mr. Schrader manages to deliver a jolt an image a line reading and even a scene ��� like a narratively decisive down-and-dirty sexual four-way ��� that fleetingly lifts ���The Canyons.�۝ But his struggle is as palpable as his budgetary limitations both of which are painfully evident in the unproductively dissonant performances and in some of his choices like the repeated scene-setting images of Christian�۪s Malibu mansion some bewildering point-of-view shots and an Expressionistic night drive that unfortunately brings to mind ���Taxi Driver �۝ which Mr. Schrader wrote. With ���The Canyons �۝ he tries to get at something real under all the hard glossy surfaces but ends up caught in the divide between the movie that he seems to have wanted to make and the one he did."

There is comic relief from a salty housekeeper and a gaggle of peeping-Tom little boys. There is Claudia Cardinale whose beauty is stupefying in a role as a perfect wife. The plot also prominently features bread olive oil and joie de vivre. It is a film with nothing but delight ��� no major revelations no gravity and no meaning." �۝ Jacques Rivette�۪s greater film with a similar plot showed the tension and power dynamics in this sort of symbiotic creation through the relationships of two bodies in one space. Mr. Trueba�۪s film on the other hand alternates between close-ups of the fascinating lines of figure and face of the model with stereotypical images of the artist�۪s life. It also casts art as being less about ideas than the opportunity to work with beautiful people and the inevitable temptation to bed them. But this isn�۪t surprising from a film that is bereft of ideas itself."

The lessons about professional cycling are detailed. And the title is earned by the attention drawn to the horrific Rwandan genocide of 1994 which haunts the athletes and has left their nation in emotional ruins. It�۪s an underdog story which always has appeal." but each team member is described in but a few traits if that.

(He served less than a year a reduced sentence for lewd behavior with the minor.) The intriguing Mr. Boyer offers emotional memories of the father who abandoned him and he makes coincidentally resonant statements about his sport�۪s physical trials: ���Cycling is about suffering �۝ he says." and there�۪s little elaboration on the ashes from which he�۪s arisen.

But Sutter has genuine heart and his cheer masks closely held fears an ambivalence about the future and an insecurity over his separated parents�۪ past." James Ponsoldt�۪s new film ���The Spectacular Now �۝ overcomes echoes of familiarity as Sutter finds his way through the end of high school and the responsibilities looming after graduation (that perennial movie horizon) in his small town. Much of this patiently achieved success flows from Miles Teller�۪s winning seemingly effortless performance as Sutter in all his laziness and charm open-mindedness and fatalism always with a glimpse of the unease beneath." the movie picks up with Sutter immediately after he is dumped by Cassidy (Brie Larson) over a misunderstanding. As in Mr. Ponsoldt�۪s other features ���Off the Black�۝ and ���Smashed �۝ booze has a place in the routine of the main character and Sutter is no different if perhaps unusual for his age. He recharges his spirits from a flask even while on the job at a men�۪s wear shop whose owner is played by a gravelly-voiced Bob Odenkirk." a very together bookworm who is dealing with a demanding family life and is unaccustomed to the attention. They make a sweet couple even if Sutter still has one eye on Cassidy and their bond bears out Sutter�۪s better tendencies. It also seems to strengthen him enough to confront his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and sister (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) about the father he never sees." Sutter�۪s fresh understanding of his dad (Kyle Chandler) yields a warning of the wrong way forward and the ever-renewable sting of abandonment." Ga. where he grew up Mr. Ponsoldt keeps the perspective close to Sutter near enough for us to sense faintly that sadness in him. The story adapted from the novel�۪s first-person voice by the screenwriters of ���(500) Days of Summer �۝ becomes a bit strained by a third-act bump that comes after the film has already successfully darkened somewhat. Yet Mr. Ponsoldt ably charts a journey through the high stakes of adolescence with both Sutter and Mr. Teller showing great promise."

Be grateful; there�۪s nothing to see on dry land that�۪s anywhere near as compelling." Andy and Jimmy Kelly (Myles Pollard and Xavier Samuel) this earnestly old-fashioned tale telegraphs its conclusion with every bromidic beat. Boxed into the characters of principled straight arrow and creative wild card the brothers strive to establish a shop selling homemade surfing gear. (Mom helpfully sews the wet suits; she rarely moves from behind the machine for the entirety of the movie.)" a shared love interest and a cartoonishly tightfisted bank manager ��� scattered through a story unable to capture the tension between bucking the system and embracing it.

�۝ a slick slippery thriller that taps into the anarchic playfulness that made the best American action flicks of the 1980s and �۪90s pop. Directed by Baltasar Kormakur riffing on the cheerful irreverence of Shane Black and the hyperbolic style of Tony Scott the movie turns on a pair of seemingly bad guys who may be good. A reissue of the five-part comic series on which it�۪s based sets the scene nicely: ���Two guys walk into a bank. It goes badly.�۝ It does in the movies as well although now the duo spring off the page courtesy of Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg one of the better odd couples to bond and bicker since Mel met Danny." Bobby (Mr. Washington) and a fast talker Stig (Mr. Wahlberg) are the resident ebony-and-ivory tag ��� but are they cops or are they robbers? Stig certainly sounds like a nod to Riggs the funny frantic cop played by Mel Gibson in the ���Lethal Weapon�۝ series as does Stig�۪s jokey yammering military-honed skill set and concern for animal welfare. (Mr. Wahlberg has the sweet appeal of the young Mr. Gibson if none of the unnerving dangerousness.) In Steven Grant�۪s original comic Stig is called Steadman and Bobby looks like a California surfer complete with a blond flop and goatee. The casting of Mr. Washington augmented with a fully upholstered chin underscores the ���Lethal Weapon�۝ connection even if he sexes up the joint in a way that Danny Glover�۪s family man never could." who embellishes the tricky story with generous repartee the movie opens with Stig and Bobby edging around a Texas town and then settling into a diner for some breakfast and banter. An irrepressible flirt Stig plays with a pretty waitress but it�۪s soon clear that his heart belongs to Bobby. (Unlike in the ���Lethal Weapon�۝ series there isn�۪t a dead wife or a living brood to bring anyone down.) Across from the diner there�۪s also a tiny bank that Bobby and Stig plan to relieve of $3 million belonging to Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) the head of a Mexican drug cartel who in turn has recently relieved an associate of his head." briefly seen peeking out of a satchel is a cheerfully vulgar touch as is the glib use of Mexican cartel violence. Both feel almost calculated to offend but like many other action movies of this blithe type ���2 Guns�۝ doesn�۪t take place in the here and the now but in a burlesque version of the same. Some of its artificiality can be chalked up to the usual mainstream filmmaking imperatives like stars who are at once recognizably real and prettier thinner and sleeker with whiter teeth and glossier skin like the operative for the Drug Enforcement Agency played here by Paula Patton. Even Mr. Olmos�۪s beautiful craggy mug looks buffed. That same unreality principle extends to the story and Mr. Kormakur�۪s bright uncluttered style which instantly shake off the real world and its obligations thrusting the film straight into fantasy." even more so as this twisty film grows increasingly complicated and preposterous with the addition of some Navy types (James Marsden and Fred Ward among others) a Central Intelligence Agency whack job (a funny Bill Paxton) swooping in on a black helicopter and empty gesturing at corrupt national institutions. Working with an editor Michael Tronick who doesn�۪t step on the sometimes wittily choreographed action by overcutting Mr. Kormakur sets and keeps up a fast rather than frantic pace that never runs the movie off the rails even when the story nearly does. Much as he did in his last movie ���Contraband �۝ another thriller with Mr. Wahlberg Mr. Kormakur has put his imprimatur on a pulp fiction that easily could have become another generic diversion instead of a fine genre one." including a disturbing scene involving live chickens that�۪s both played for laughs and comes with a sharp ethical jab."

That said Mr. Hoene hides a few surprises amid the rotting flesh (finally someone has noticed that any zombie mob would logically include the under-5s) and Daniel Bronks�۪s photography reveals an East End gradually being swallowed by gleaming tower blocks.

The training in the Catskills paid mainstream dividends for busboys and tummlers (who amused hotel guests with shtick) like Danny Kaye and Sid Caesar. Yet the filmmakers fail to show the broader impact that these comics still have on pop culture." Mort Sahl and Dick Gregory get a foothold. They trafficked in social and political issues like civil rights but they didn�۪t appeal to the Catskill guests and comedians who steered clear of off-color jokes.

The first one was set in New York. Here the action switches to Paris as the nefarious Gargamel (Hank Azaria again putting more effort into his role than anyone else is) sets out to increase his supply of Smurf essence. Yes Smurf essence. Don�۪t ask." and the inevitable rescue mission begins shortly after. Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays again play the Smurf-friendly human couple who help the rescue along though neither seems very happy about being in a Smurf sequel.

It�۪s a familiar story with a few of the usual suspects starting with the husband Hal (a perfect Alec Baldwin all smile and no soul) an investment type who has talked high yields all the way to prison. The government took him and then it took the rest leaving Jasmine with little more than her designer threads and luggage." Blanche ��� the names seem fated for each. Mr. Allen has said that he didn�۪t see Ms. Blanchett play Tennessee Williams�۪s most famous creation in Liv Ullmann�۪s celebrated 2009 production of ���A Streetcar Named Desire�۝ at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. (Jasmine�۪s appalled aside about being forced to move to Brooklyn after being priced out of Manhattan amusingly suggests why he didn�۪t.) Whatever his inspiration he has been rummaging around in the classics for decades so his appropriation of ���Streetcar�۝ doesn�۪t surprise. What does is his reimagining Blanche by way of another figure who changes depending on how you hold her up to the light Ruth Madoff the wife of Bernard L.

It�۪s a masterly stroke that puts Jasmine�۪s dissembling into fresh chilling perspective." and her contradictions ��� along with the vodka she guzzles and the Xanax she pops ��� keep her in pieces.

With a series of sharp contrapuntal flashbacks that move forward in time ��� Hal and Jasmine in their empty new Park Avenue apartment and then later presiding over a dinner bathed in light so burnished golden calf must have been on the menu ��� Mr. Allen illustrates just how drastically she�۪s been humbled. The flashbacks tell part of the story as does Jasmine�۪s faraway stare her mood swings and the patter that telegraphs her privilege (���I don�۪t know how anyone can breathe with low ceilings�۝) and which over time will sound like the ravings of a homeless woman you might see in certain neighborhoods the one in ratty furs pushing a cart." Jasmine flutters about cementing her resemblance to the mothlike Blanche. The allusions to ���Streetcar�۝ are copious and obvious and spotting the quotations initially feels like a kind of humorous parlor game from the French connection that links Blanche and Jasmine�۪s names to Mr. Allen�۪s staging of a violent skirmish which echoes a similar one in Elia Kazan�۪s film adaptation. Underscoring the resemblances Jasmine repeatedly explains that ���Blue Moon�۝ was playing when she met Hal memories that evoke the blue piano that as Williams wrote in ���Streetcar �۝ expresses ���the spirit of the life which goes on here.�۝ In the play Blanche also says that Stanley isn�۪t the type who goes for jasmine perfume an aside that carries an accusation." if with critical differences in the figures of Ginger�۪s ex-husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) and her current lover Chili (Bobby Cannavale).

So too did Hal perhaps the story�۪s only real villain but who like Augie and Chili never emerges as a serious countervailing force to Jasmine as Stanley is to Blanche. As if to make up for this missing piece Mr. Allen himself advances the strongest argument against Jasmine. If he never succeeds in diminishing her appeal it�۪s both because Ms. Blanchett maintains a vise grip on the character�۪s humanity and because it becomes inexorably clear that while losing her money helped push Jasmine over the edge it was also the dirty easy money what it promised and delivered that drove her nuts to begin with." and when did she know it? These questions come to haunt ���Blue Jasmine �۝ and as the past catches up with the present they help drive this moving sometimes funny film toward its shattering end. If at times Mr. Allen seems to be answering those questions by pulling the film in one direction even as Ms. Blanchett pulls it in another this productive dissonance deepens the tension and stakes and as with a climactic confrontation between Jasmine and Hal can turn a raw scene into a revelation.

There�۪s just one problem: His older brother John (Josu̩ Gutierrez) has used the boat to finance his cocaine-and-Klonopin habit." ���Red Tide�۝ offers unsympathetic characters ��� John�۪s fianc̩e (Michele Feren Simms) does little but supply her beloved with downers to stop him from bouncing off the walls ��� engaged in uninteresting pursuits. Murder is plotted and illicit romance is kindled and a dealer named Harry (as invisible as the algae and sounding exactly like the masked torturer from the ���Saw�۝ movies) lurks off screen. But the undisciplined shooting style and underdeveloped script confound the actors at every turn. Despite their best efforts they never overcome the limitations of a movie more intent on cutting corners than fleshing out a story."

It has all the requisite special effects and big-ticket action sequences ��� including a fight on a moving train and a climactic punch-out between the hero and a villain in an oversize metal suit ��� but it also has an unusually intimate small-scale feel. Inspired by a series published by Marvel in the 1980s it has more old-style comic-book atmosphere than ���Man of Steel�۝ or ���Iron Man 3.�۝ Instead of expounding a tedious origin story or staging an epic battle for apocalyptic stakes ���The Wolverine�۝ focuses on a specific and self-contained adventure in a richly imagined place." where Logan (as the bewhiskered berserker is also known) witnesses the bombing of Nagasaki at the end of World War II. The destruction of cities is of course a staple of action moviemaking and it is usually saved for the end and shown in crashing flaming detail. Mr. Mangold defies clich̩ by dramatizing the actual devastation of a city from a discreet distance early in the film. The atomic bomb casts its shadow over the rest of the movie ��� much as the Holocaust did in ���X-Men: First Class�۝ ��� in a sober tactful way a sign that the filmmaker is not simply stirring reality into fantasy but rather trying to think about the relationship between them." where he proves himself a friend to grizzly bears and an enemy of hunters and personal grooming Logan is spirited back to Japan.

If you do you may wonder who the two scruffy guys are in the car that�۪s chasing the big truck that�۪s being driven by two other disheveled guys who seem to have something to do with Choi whose path and fate will soon cross with those of Captain Zhang once this heroically peripatetic detective gets off his bus." after bringing down someone with a high-flying scissor hold brings you into a complicated tale that reaches from the crime lords who imperiously flout China�۪s draconian drug laws to the struggling men and women who in an earlier age would have been slaving over the emperor�۪s lands.

One day Mom Dad and the girls are settling into their conveniently sprawling creaking squeaking two-story house ��� the rooms quickly become a disorienting maze ��� and the next they�۪re playing hide and creep with a mysterious increasingly malevolent force." the movie opens with a jittery funny prologue involving a couple of pretty nurses right out of a Roger Corman quickie a devil doll named Annabelle (shades of Rod Serling and Chucky) and a pair of married paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga).

Evidently it�۪s easier to believe in the terrors that can�۪t hurt us than to believe in those that can which may partly account for why so many vampires zombies and their paranormal ilk are running amok in the popular imagination. Each era brings its own allegorical terrors and in the 1970s a golden age of horror cinema the aftershocks of the 1960s found expression in stories about diabolically terrifying spawn who with their swiveling heads and annihilating violence were grotesque embodiments of a generational anxiety." it also taps into the paranoia that is both an evergreen American trait and a crucial characteristic of films of that era horror and otherwise. With amusing self-awareness Mr. Wan (his earlier movies include ���Saw�۝ and ���Insidious�۝) leans on the usual genre tricks throughout making you jump with hard edits and doors being squeaked open by unseen hands. But he also makes intelligent use of narrative delay and ellipses that help build suspense and suspicion. The script generally doesn�۪t overexplain and neither does he. When things start going wrong at the Perrons�۪ ��� a bird crashes into the house bruises bloom on Carolyn�۪s body ��� the family knows something�۪s amiss but can�۪t read the signs.

Their characters are as appealing as the Perrons but Mr. Wan smartly keeps enough distance from the Warrens that you can see that these true believers are also hovering at the edge of dangerous fanaticism. That gives the movie a shiver of political currency even if a greater more sustaining pleasure of this particular haunted-house fantasy is how it works as a metaphor for moviegoing itself. When the Perrons first settle into their house they�۪re facing the future with bright anxious smiles that aren�۪t much different from those of the horror-film faithful who are waiting nervously hopefully to be jolted by the next great shocker.

even while you wait in vain for the funny to pop in her latest. A forced laugh-challenged comedy with an appealing if not terribly well-used cast ���Girl Most Likely�۝ is the first movie that Ms. Wiig has taken the lead in since the 2011 runaway hit ���Bridesmaids.�۝ In that comedy she played an amusingly self-involved singleton without a love life bright prospects or a home to call her very own. (Mind you she did have Jon Hamm on demand.) In ���Girl Most Likely �۝ she again plays a single gal who after being booted out of Manhattan (long story) dusts herself off and tries all over again this time while flopping with family in New Jersey." or at least a generic abstraction of it plays a significant role in ���Girl Most Likely �۝ which was written by Michelle Morgan and directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini. When the movie opens Ms. Wiig�۪s character Imogene is safely ensconced in that glistening bubble called the Upper East Side where she�۪s busily getting ready for a soiree. She keeps calling her boyfriend Peter (Brian Petsos) leaving messages that as she races from apartment to taxi and party tremble with intensifying barely contained desperation. By the time the party is over her relationship is too and most everything else seems imperiled including her friendships with a gaggle of socialite simpletons (June Diane Raphael among others)." Zelda (Annette Bening). Wielding an accent even more strategically gaudy than her tight sparkly clothes Zelda is the walking tawking embodiment of Imogene�۪s fears and prejudices. Zelda�۪s name suggests both class aspirations and maybe psychological instability but mostly she registers as a classically cartoonish mother one nesting with a kooky male threesome that includes her sweetly oddball son Ralph (Christopher Fitzgerald) a lover the Bosche (Matt Dillon) and a roomer Lee (Darren Criss). Unsurprisingly there�۪s more to Zelda than her tube tops and inoffensively bad habits even if the smart yet oh-so-stupid Imogene is the last to know it." ���The Nanny Diaries �۝ is a charmless ungainly comedy that as the awkwardly directed ���Girl Most Likely�۝ suggests may not have been the anomalous misfire it seemed. Ms. Morgan�۪s script chugs along on low-key humor and leans on more clich̩s (you can go home again at least in movies) than it mildly subverts so it needed directors who could give it real lift and bounce. Despite Ms. Wiig Imogene remains similarly flat more of an outline than the filled-in personality that would have elevated her sitcom agonies (and a stalled playwriting career) into something truthful." the actors keep you watching and hoping and sometimes manage to find a moment of grace as when Imogene goes to Atlantic City to hear Lee perform in a 1990s cover band. As she sits frozen in place eddies of embarrassment (for him for her) tug at her features and shudder through her body even as she begins rocking and nodding to the beat. As she realizes he�۪s actually pretty good her discomfort turns into incredulity and then delight a transformation that�۪s both fun to watch and meaningful because as her reserve crumbles so does a lifetime of carefully foolishly nurtured pretenses. Lee has a real gift and so too does Imogene the difference being that before she can have her moment she first needs to learn one tediously long lesson."

A fascinating subtext of the film is that the terms ���pimp�۝ and ���game�۝ refer both to the sometimes illegal strategies for surviving street life and to the storytelling and selling of that experience through art.

For a young Afro-Colombian like Tomas who is harassed by security guards at the mall it�۪s a way of finding strength in a heritage that is all too often used against him." an urban drama limited by its nonprofessional cast and impressionistic scattered storytelling.

Looking for the spark amid the drudgery and the conflicted tradition of such labor Mr. Erice singles out in a panoramic black-and-white photograph of a crowded mess hall one woman�۪s Mona Lisa smile." falling into line with the title�۪s tour guide echo.

In the quartet�۪s closer ���O Conquistador Conquistado�۝ (���The Conqueror Conquered�۝) Mr. Oliveira closely directs another variation on colonialism and the power dynamics and aesthetics of the gaze. The Oliveira regular (and grandson) Ricardo Tr̻pa plays a tour guide who seems most struck by how the voracious sightseeing rabble turn the tables on statues of his country�۪s high and mighty." and the film�۪s final shot might seem a little too apt a summary of an audience�۪s reaction: Mr. Tr̻pa looking into the camera shrugs."

Rather everyone involved from Sam�۪s attentive but far from clingy parents (Emilia Fox and Ben Chaplin) to his sensible best friend (Alex Etel) to his cheerfully punkish district nurse (Natalia Tena) seems incapable of being maudlin. To Sam the end of life is a mystery he�۪s compelled to solve." this British-Spanish production gingerly addresses terminal illness in ways that won�۪t traumatize your tween. Brief bursts of animation jolly things along as Sam records a video diary of last-minute wishes (ride in an airship; behave like a teenager) and last-call concerns (how do you know when you�۪ve died?). The screenplay struggles to make room for his shamefully underwritten mother though his father enjoys a nicely nuanced arc from stiff denial to just-in-time acceptance." ���Ways to Live Forever�۝ contemplates the grave with quirky intelligence.

They don�۪t call it DreamWorks for nothing. But it is interesting to note that a movie strenuously preaching the virtue of being different should be so fundamentally ��� so deliberately so timidly ��� just like everything else of its kind.

Why you wonder should it be necessary for a snail to win the world�۪s most famous car race? Wouldn�۪t competing be impressive enough? I�۪m sort of kidding but there is something sad about the idea that a group of hard-working entrepreneurs can hope to succeed only by cutting a deal with the hyper-commercial winner-take-all forces of celebrity and global media.

The encounter between geeks and seekers generates some fine comic moments ��� as when an earnest young code writer (Patrick Riester) falls into the clutches of a swinging older couple (Chris Doubek and Cyndi Williams) ��� and an intriguing sociological connection. Spiritual exploration and technological innovation are not necessarily very far apart and both play a crucial perhaps misunderstood role in recent history." all of it far less powerful than the cellphone in a given viewer�۪s pocket. And while slow progress is being made in computer chess the triumph of I.B.M.�۪s Deep Blue seems a very long way off." the superficially distant reality of ���Computer Chess�۝ is recognizably our own. The personalities of the programmers are refreshingly idiosyncratic playing against easy stereotypes. There is a fine line between genius and fraud and between inspiration and error.

Handsome but with hooded eyes he looks far from angelic. His plea resonates through this nightmarish story of an innocent man who becomes the victim of a small-town witch hunt. The movie directed by Thomas Vinterberg from a screenplay he wrote with Tobias Lindholm is easily Mr. Vinterberg�۪s strongest since ���The Celebration�۝ (1998) which also addressed pedophilia." a much-loved teacher in a Danish hunting village begins to come apart when Theo�۪s young daughter Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) vaguely intimates to her teacher Grethe (Susse Wold) that Lucas exposed himself to her. What the little girl has seen and quickly forgotten is a glimpse of pornographic imagery on an older brother�۪s iPad that in her mind has become confused with Lucas on whom she has an innocent crush." the adults won�۪t let it drop. And before long other children responding to grown-up suggestions help build a case against Lucas as a predator who lured children into his home�۪s nonexistent basement. Lucas is not jailed after a court inquiry but villagers are still convinced of his guilt and his life is in danger." its comparisons of humans to the creatures they stalk run deep. An early scene of rowdy woodsmen drinking themselves insensate seethes with an undercurrent of potentially explosive violence." who is recovering from a bitter divorce has a new girlfriend (Alexandra Rapaport) whom he furiously kicks out of the house when she voices a tinge of uncertainty about his innocence. Instead of cowering in terror Lucas confronts his accusers and fights back. But an irrational mob mentality has seized the village. Lucas becomes a pariah expelled from civilized society reviled by neighbors who throw rocks through his windows and prevent him from shopping in stores. When his teenage son Marcus (Lasse Fogelstrom) stands up for him the boy is attacked." the story is set in the months leading up to Christmas. The contrast between the villagers�۪ fear and hatred and the lofty spiritual ethos in the season of lights infuses ���The Hunt�۝ with an extra chill. The Christmas scenes bring to mind Ingmar Bergman�۪s ���Fanny and Alexander �۝ in which wondrous enchantment collides with demonic religiosity. But ���The Hunt�۝ doesn�۪t know where to stop. It is undermined with a short unsatisfying epilogue whose shocking final moment isn�۪t enough to justify its inclusion." like the French director Bruno Dumont has a gift for evoking the atavistic side of human nature. Once Lucas is a pariah the neutral expressions of his accusers can�۪t begin to camouflage what feels like a primitive animal cunning.

She attaches herself to another American tourist Jamie (Michael Cera) after he casually invites her to join him and his friends. Perfectly played by Gaby Hoffmann Crystal Fairy has all the hallmarks of a professed earth mother holding the keys to truth peace love and wisdom. She has her charms but like many such know-it-alls she can be overbearing and preachy." where Jamie remarks that Crystal who is dancing by herself in a theatrical trance resembles a ���dark tornado.�۝ He also comments on the quality of Chilean drugs in the pretentious manner of a connoisseur. At the same time Mr. Cera exudes the gawky bravado of an unformed man-child straining to act like a grown-up." Lel (Jos̩ Miguel Silva) and Pilo (Agust�_n Silva) Jamie is headed for the Atacama Desert where they plan to drink mescaline tea brewed from slices of a San Pedro cactus and then trip all day on the beach. But persuading the local residents to part with their cactuses is no easy task. When his crass offers to buy a piece of cactus are flatly rejected Jamie resorts to theft." who include the director�۪s three brothers. The seeming casualness is such that at a certain point you feel like a traveler on a real-life journey during which the tensions between Jamie and Crystal threaten to erupt into warfare. Crystal masks her frustration and anger by affecting an attitude of tolerant superiority toward Jamie�۪s impatience and air of entitlement. But it�۪s obvious that his brusque self-assurance is a ruse camouflaging insecurity." Crystal emerges naked from a shower and remains unclothed while Jamie squirms with embarrassment. Crystal who doesn�۪t seem to notice believes ardently in savoring the moment and in treating every activity as a sacred ritual. A psychic bully she insists that the travelers put magic stones in their tea and spouts tired platitudes about cosmic connectedness. She is obsessed with doomsday prophecies surrounding the Maya calendar and warns of humanity�۪s imminent demise." and the characters�۪ physical presences are as revealing as their words. The performances give you an almost uncomfortable sense of proximity." only some subtly glowing colors and muted echoes. The men frolic in the surf while Crystal naked wanders off among the rocks." and the mescaline wears off she returns and raw emotions surface. When Jamie apologizes to Crystal for his highhanded behavior it feels as if a layer of his defense had been temporarily peeled away. Crystal gets off her spiritual high horse and relives a traumatic moment at a party when she was a teenager. If it all feels entirely real the movie doesn�۪t imagine that the drug has been a mystical life-changing experience."

2009 Oscar Grant III unarmed and lying face down on a subway platform in Oakland Calif. was shot in the back by a white Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer. The incident captured on video by onlookers incited protest unrest and arguments similar to those that would swirl around the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida a few years later. The deaths of these and other African-American young men (Mr. Grant was 22) touch some of the rawest nerves in the body politic and raise thorny and apparently intractable issues of law and order violence and race." �۝ Ryan Coogler�۪s powerful and sensitive debut feature which imaginatively reconstructs the last 24 or so hours of Oscar Grant�۪s life flashing back from a horrifying snippet of actual cellphone video of the hectic moments before the shooting. But Mr. Coogler a 27-year-old Bay Area native who went to film school at the University of Southern California examines his subject with a steady objective eye and tells his story in the key of wise heartbreak rather than blind rage. It is not that the movie is apolitical or disengaged from the painful public implications of Mr. Grant�۪s fate. But everything it has to say about class masculinity and the tricky relations among different kinds of people in a proudly diverse and liberal metropolis is embedded in details of character and place." �۝ though to fans of ���The Wire �۝ he will always be Wallace) Oscar is a case study in confusion unsure of where he�۪s going and a source of worry to those who love him. He dotes on his daughter Tatiana and seems sincere in his desire ��� if not entirely steady in his resolve ��� to stay with her mother Sophina (Melonie Diaz). His own mother Wanda (Octavia Spencer) is still able to boss him around and he spends a lot of the day shopping for her birthday party." easy sweetness to Oscar but neither Mr. Coogler�۪s script nor Mr. Jordan�۪s performance sugarcoats his temperament. He is for one thing irresponsible and not always honest unable to admit to Sophina or Wanda that he has been fired from his supermarket job for chronic lateness. Even after two stints in prison (one visited in the film�۪s only chronological digression) he is still selling drugs and his vows to stop have the feel of New Year�۪s resolutions inspiring more hope than confidence." with a ground-level hand-held shooting style that sometimes evokes the spiritually alert naturalism of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne has enough faith in his actors and in the intrinsic interest of the characters�۪ lives to keep overt sentimentality and messagemongering to a minimum. You get the sense that he might have made this movie even if the world had not handed him a terrible true story and made any day in the life of Oscar Grant into a sad touching and subtle film." in truth Mr. Coogler has made that movie even as he has also made one full of anger grief and frustration. His main intention ��� and his great achievement as well as Mr. Jordan�۪s ��� is to make Oscar a fully human presence to pay him the respect of acknowledging his complexities and contradictions. The radicalism of ���Fruitvale Station�۝ lies precisely here in its refusal to turn a man into a symbol. Nearly every black man whether or not he is president tends to be flattened out by popular culture and the psychopathology of everyday American life rendered as an innocent victim a noble warrior or a menace to society. There is a dehumanizing violence in this habit a willed toxic blindness that ���Fruitvale Station�۝ at once exposes and resists." the social environment they navigate and the language they speak are treated with a similarly nuanced attention. Sophina and Wanda have their own burdens and distractions and they deal with Oscar�۪s shortcomings as well as they can. The streets of Hayward Oakland and San Francisco and the cars of the BART trains are places of happy chaos and spontaneous solidarity but also contested spaces where violence often seems close at hand." ���Fruitvale Station�۝ is rarely predictable. The climactic encounter with BART police officers erupts in a mood of vertiginous uncertainty defusing facile or inflammatory judgments and bending the audience�۪s reflexive emotional horror and moral outrage toward a necessary and difficult ethical inquiry. How could this have happened? How did we ��� meaning any one of us who might see faces like our own depicted on that screen ��� allow it?" violence and other facts of life."

His search leads to a farm whose pornography-addicted owner Johnny (Elijah Wood) maintains a menagerie of naked kidnapped women shackled like wild animals in cages and writhing in their own filth.

or so it appears for Philipp the busy actor in his prime who shuttles between Hamburg and Vienna in ���The Shine of Day.�۝ He plays roles in works from ���Woyzeck�۝ to ���Puss in Boots �۝ and as embodied by the European stage veteran Philipp Hochmair he�۪s either running lines at home or immortalizing his latest costume in a photo booth when he�۪s not in front of an audience." a long-lost uncle who appears one day at Philipp�۪s doorstep. What follows in Tizza Covi and Rainer Frimmel�۪s loose-knit film isn�۪t the expected odd-couple clash ��� Walter a circus performer at loose ends couch-surfs chez Philipp ��� or fraught family homecoming. It�۪s a chronicle of an encounter between performers at different stations in life as Walter looks past some of his wistfulness and orneriness and finds a place in his energetic nephew�۪s life. In turn he pulls the younger perhaps myopically focused artist into less fictional dramas." an overburdened contractor and father of two whose mother can�۪t get into the country. That brush with the day-to-day turbulence underlying contemporary Europe and the presence of Walter Saabel the unassuming yet rugged circus veteran who plays Philipp�۪s uncle help mark the film as the work of Ms. Covi and Mr. Frimmel. A filmmaking team with a past in documentary and an Italian neorealist fondness for theater as a life-embracing allegory they�۪ve brought the impulse to wait and see to this film and to their fiction debut about an abandoned toddler ���Little Girl (La Pivellina)�۝ (2011)." ���The Shine of Day�۝ pulls itself together with an ending that feels a bit ready-made for drawing out the parallels between its kindred performers. But the movie gratifyingly observes the openness that seems the base line for Philipp and Walter and the glimmer of realization in a stage actor about the void that may lurk among his many liberating roles. This could be something of a clich̩ too but the filmmakers recognize that even as Philipp goes straight back to work under the lights and in front of the eyes of others he�۪s doing so as a different person than when he last stepped off."

She pressures her out-of-shape friends to compete with the town�۪s championship high school team in a charity tournament." the movie directed by Susan Seidelman from a heavily salted screenplay by Brad Hennig occupies that semirural never-never land of twangy-sounding small-town stereotypes whose patron saint is Dolly Parton." a combative motorcycle mama renowned for baking drug-enhanced desserts like Purple Haze Pecan Pie; Clementine (Virginia Madsen) five times divorced and who boasts of her ���nonexistent gag reflex�۝; Ginger (Daryl Hannah) a closeted lesbian whose prattling on about her ���roommate�۝ fools no one; and the town�۪s African-American mayor Florine (Wanda Sykes) who is running for re-election." which starred Madonna as a free-spirited pop tart to the stiff-jointed worlds of her 2006 film ���Boynton Beach Club �۝ set in a Florida retirement community and ���The Hot Flashes.�۝ With these recent movies Ms. Seidelman has staked her claim to being an observer of the ���Golden Girls�۝ set. ���The Hot Flashes �۝ whose stars are in their late 40s and early 50s gently preaches that eternal sexual allure is no substitute for things that really matter like team spirit and enduring friendship." at 54 is older than the actors playing the Hot Flashes." the movie is a mess.

say as you cower before the Imax screen your 3-D glasses digging into the bridge of your nose condensation from your Diet Coke dripping onto your leg ��� ���Pacific Rim�۝ looks a lot like other movies of its type. Dinosaurish creatures as big as skyscrapers do battle with equally gigantic robots on land and sea pulverizing familiar cities and churning up geysers of spume. Human characters (some of whom are actually inside the giant robots) bark out catchphrases spout fake science and express noble sentiments as they fight to save the planet. More than two hours of your life elapse before they do." or even novelty you may find yourself more tormented than entertained. But ���Pacific Rim�۝ is also a reminder ��� either just in time or much too late ��� that this kind of movie can and should be fun. Some of those catchphrases are mildly clever. The lab coat mumbo-jumbo is amusing. The noble sentiments touch sweet chords. And who does not delight in seeing a robot punch a dinosaur every now and then ��� or pretty much constantly for two hours?" Guillermo del Toro (who wrote the script with Travis Beacham) is an unabashed genre enthusiast and a feverish inventor of fantastical worlds enchanted by the visual and symbolic power of monsters and intoxicated by his own imagination. It is true that he has employed that imagination to more memorable effect in other movies notably the wonderful ���Hellboy�۝ pictures and the shattering Spanish Civil War horror-allegories ���Pan�۪s Labyrinth�۝ and ���The Devil�۪s Backbone.�۝ Admirers of those films may find this one crude and overscale by comparison. Still ���Pacific Rim �۝ with its carefree blend of silliness and solemnity is clearly the product of an ingenious and playful pop sensibility." though not immediately intelligible out of context (or in it for that matter) is in some ways the key to the movie. A bit of explanation is in order though I�۪m afraid it will not be as exhaustive or as breathless as the voice-over narration that begins the movie or the expository dialogue that pops up throughout. Gipsy is a Jaeger one of the enormous metal bipeds built to fight off the Kaiju horrible creatures who have popped up through the bottom of the Pacific Ocean via a portal to their native dimension." as alien invaders tend to be quite hostile. They are also diabolically clever evolving quickly in response to military attempts to defeat them. After a long war of attrition (dramatized in a precredit chunk that is almost a movie in itself) only a handful of Jaegers remain concentrated in Hong Kong for a last stand against the enemy. Commanded by the wondrously named Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) the Jaeger pilots ��� who must work in pairs assisted by technology that links their brains ��� are a motley global crew. Our attention is particularly focused on Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) who seem to have especially traumatic experiences with Kaiju in their pasts." who are hard to tell apart trade a few punches at one point ��� and a duo of manic mismatched scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) for comic relief. Hellboy himself (that is Ron Perlman) shows up as a local underworld figure doing more for the film�۪s attitude than for its plot. Wearing dark glasses and metal-toed shoes and spouting Runyonesque gangster gibberish he reminds you that ���Pacific Rim�۝ is more than anything else a cartoon." which is able to keep fighting when some bad Kaiju mojo shuts down the fancy digital Jaeger. ���Pacific Rim�۝ is loaded with computer-generated imagery but its soul is proudly mechanical. Its off-kilter sense of proportion harks back to the inspired models and stop-motion techniques of the late special-effects maestro Ray Harryhausen. Even in 3-D (which does not add much of interest) the images are composed of bright tones and blocky shapes like old comic-book panels. And this future for all the talk of ���neural drift�۝ and dimensional wormholes is a world of tubes and rivets and pistons. Jules Verne and H. G. Wells would appreciate it." �۝ in other words are somewhat nostalgic and maybe also regressive. This in itself is hardly unusual: most of the movies released by major studios from May to September cater to the childish impulses of the audience. But they also often aspire to be more than juvenile puffing themselves up with money and fuzzy heavy themes. Sometimes they succeed and find a measure of real grandeur. This summer though has so far largely been a parade of joyless bombast. In these circumstances Mr. del Toro�۪s exuberant nonsense comes as a relief." carefully edited slaughter of untold millions and a lot of Kaiju blood."

�۝ a mano-a-mano action thriller as subtle as its title is so pretentious that you may wonder at least briefly if its antiwar metaphors are conning you while the film is purposefully wallowing in bathos. How else to explain its improbable story? More improbable is that an early draft of its screenplay was lauded on an industry watch list for best unproduced scripts." but it�۪s not good.

Way Back �۝ a summertime coming-of-age tale written and directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash is infused with nostalgia. The movie�۪s title seems to refer to the rear-facing third seat of the massive old station wagon where we first encounter its hero a glum 14-year-old boy named Duncan (Liam James). But it also describes a hazy bittersweet mood of recollection that hovers around the action like July humidity." there are a battered water park and an antique Pac-Man machine at the controls of which Duncan meets Owen (Sam Rockwell) who will become his mentor and confidant. Owen who manages the park is the more sympathetic of the two surrogate fathers who dominate Duncan�۪s days and fight implicitly for his young soul. The bad dad is Trent (Steve Carell) the owner of the station wagon and the rambling beach house where Duncan and his mother Pam (Toni Collette) Trent�۪s girlfriend are spending their vacation." so it is easy enough as I suspect the filmmakers have done to peel back the years and find your own experiences in Duncan�۪s. ���The Way Way Back�۝ has the charm of timelessness but also more than a touch of triteness. Its situations and feelings seem drawn more from available sentimental ideas about adolescence than from the perceptions of any particular adolescent." awkward seething boy into a more confident version of himself and the older actors provide a vivid omnibus of the varieties of adult awfulness. We know from the start that Trent is a bit of a jerk because of the way he treats Duncan calling him ���buddy�۝ and subjecting the boy to the kind of humiliations that a certain kind of failed man thinks will build character. Just how much of a jerk Trent is will emerge later largely at the expense of Pam who is too timid and too desperately attached to her lover to stand up for her son." a boozy neighbor (Allison Janney reliably finding soul and nuance in a broad cartoonish supporting role) and Kip and Joan a fun-loving couple (Rob Corddry and Amanda Peet) who seem to have wandered in from the discarded draft of a middle-period John Updike novel. Duncan is also oppressed by a passel of mean girls led by Trent�۪s daughter. Luckily there is an unused bicycle to carry him to Water Wizz where he is buoyed by Owen�۪s peppery sarcasm and the friendly attention of some of the other workers (among them Maya Rudolph and the film�۪s directing team). The romantic possibilities of the coming-of-age summer are represented by Betty�۪s daughter Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) who is bookish and thoughtful and a little older than Duncan and therefore perfect first-kiss material." Oscar winners (with Alexander Payne) for their ���Descendants�۝ screenplay who are making their directing debut approach Duncan�۪s story with gentle good humor underplaying both comic moments and emotional explosions. While this restraint makes ���The Way Way Back�۝ pleasantly watchable it also makes it feel small and anecdotal a modest variation on something you�۪ve seen before." Way Back�۝ is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some naughty words and deeds courtesy of the grown-ups."

His adventures were heard on radio starting in the 1930s and seen on television from 1949 to 1957 but unlike some of his cape-wearing peers he has mostly stayed in the past an object of fuzzy nostalgia and mocking incredulity a symbol of simple pleasures and retrograde attitudes." and so now we have ���The Lone Ranger �۝ a very long very busy movie that will unite the generations in bafflement stupefaction and occasional delight. Directed by Gore Verbinski from a script credited to Justin Haythe Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio the movie tries to do for the post-Civil-War frontier what the ���Pirates of the Caribbean�۝ franchise did for the high seas in the Age of Sail turning history (including the history of movies) into a hyperactive multipurpose amusement machine." facetious knowingness with na��ve omnivorous enthusiasm ��� pays off nicely. The main action of ���The Lone Ranger�۝ takes place in a fantastical 1869 Texas but it�۪s framed by scenes set in San Francisco in 1933 the year the Lone Ranger made his radio debut. As the half-built Golden Gate Bridge looms in the background a young boy in cowboy duds and a black mask wanders into a Wild West fairground attraction where he gazes on a taxidermied buffalo and grizzly bear and also on an elderly American Indian with a dead crow on his head. A brass plate identifies him as ���The Noble Savage in his Native Habitat.�۝ The boy comes to know him as Tonto and the rest of us recognize him even under heavy prosthetic wrinkles as Johnny Depp." weary Tonto into a somewhat unreliable narrator signals that we are in a world of tall tales and strange myths a universe of stories that fed the imaginations of many American children in the early and middle decades of the last century and that may strike their descendants as archaic and a little embarrassing. Sturdy western archetypes sit uncomfortably close to ugly ethnic stereotypes and ���The Lone Ranger�۝ tries to imagine a wholesome inclusive version of the western while reviving the time-tested touchstones of the genre." a semester-long Westerns 101 college course crammed into two and a half hours and taught by a professor whose lecture notes were rearranged by a gust of wind on his way to class. The wide-open spaces of Monument Valley (which is not really in Texas but never mind) are heavily populated with familiar characters: vengeful Comanches (their ancient chief is played by Saginaw Grant); an unscrupulous railroad tycoon (Tom Wilkinson); a blond-maned cavalry officer (Barry Pepper); a varminty snaggletoothed outlaw (William Fichtner); a sharp-tongued madam (Helena Bonham Carter); and a stoical pioneer mom (Ruth Wilson) whose husband (James Badge Dale) is a Texas Ranger named Dan Reid." John (Armie Hammer) an idealistic government lawyer who arrives in town armed with a copy of John Locke�۪s ���Two Treatises of Government�۝ and whose belief in the rule of law will be sorely tested. John who does not carry a gun carries a torch for his brother�۪s wife and eventually acquires a mysterious white horse the ���William Tell Overture�۝ and the moniker kemo sabe bestowed by his newfound sidekick Tonto. Tonto also persuades him to cover his eyes which generates a new spin on the old catchphrase: ���What�۪s with the mask?�۝" at a minimum ���The Searchers �۝ ���Once Upon a Time in the West �۝ ���The General�۝ and the Road Runner cartoons of Chuck Jones. (As well as his own ���Rango �۝ a much better western than this one.) All of these influences and more are put to hectic intermittently inspired use. Some of the action sequences combine the kinetic wit of classic cartoons with the inventive rigor of Buster Keaton movies and Mr. Depp�۪s blend of gravity and goofiness saves the day or at least alleviates the tedium on several occasions." though ���The Lone Ranger�۝ can�۪t quite pull off the daredevil feats it has assigned itself. This is an ambitious movie disguised as a popcorn throwaway nothing less than an attempt to revise reinvigorate and make fun of not just its source but also nearly every other western ever made. In trying to balance grandiosity with playfulness to lampoon cowboy-and-Indian clich̩s while taking somber account of a history of violence greed and exploitation it descends into nerve-racking incoherence." and what links them is not a creative sensibility (as would be the case in a Quentin Tarantino movie) but a carnival barker�۪s desperate need to hold on to a distracted audience�۪s attention. Look kids a man eating another man�۪s heart! A horse in a tree! A genocidal massacre! Bunny rabbits with sharp teeth! ���Who was that masked man?�۝ is a less relevant question than ���What on earth were you thinking?�۝" while frequently stylized and carefully edited is actually more intense and nasty than the rating would suggest."

It tries so hard to double your pleasure that it emerges from the test kitchen slightly burned. Like the jams and jellies that its reformed main character Gru makes in his new line of work the film combines too many flavors along with extra sugar. Once again the lesson that more is not necessarily better something rarely learned by blockbuster sequels is forgotten." the new movie ��� concocted by the same hands (the directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and the screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul) who were behind the first ���Despicable Me�۝ ��� is consistently diverting and so cute you�۪ll want to pet it. Yet it is also weightless and lacks a center. Which isn�۪t to deny its inventiveness in imagining zany whiz-bang gadgetry and its considerable achievement in the creation of a puffed-up Latin American villain who steals the spotlight from Gru (the voice of Steve Carell) the first film�۪s beaky Shrek-like central character." the reformed Gru is something of a bore." with his hearing-impaired mad scientist partner Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) has started a jam-and-jelly business whose tasteless products nobody wants.

But like Margo�۪s ill-fated crush the premise is rushed; an antidote to the serum is concocted almost as soon as the mass abduction takes place." Gru�۪s youngest daughter Agnes (Elsie Fisher) dreams that Lucy might become her new mother. This fantasy is the ickier side of a movie that crosses the line from sweet to saccharine.

even if the circumstances in which we experience art have a way of maintaining the barrier. An art museum for example is designated as a place apart from the zones of ordinary existence. We enter to gaze upon beautiful artifacts at a safe distance standing at the boundary between tedium and rapture. But really and fortunately a museum is no different from anywhere else since beauty and meaning are everywhere provided we know how to look." �۝ Jem Cohen�۪s quietly amazing sneakily sublime new film is partly a reflection on such aesthetic puzzles. Shot on high-definition digital video and super-16-millimeter film in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna the film lingers over great paintings by Rembrandt Bruegel and other European masters inviting us to contemplate the complex half-obscured tales they might tell. In one scene an art historian (Ela Piplits) tries to initiate a crowd of skeptical tourists into the mysteries of Bruegel�۪s ���Conversion of St. Paul�۝ (1567) and Mr. Cohen�۪s camera supports her arguments by finding details in the picture that might be easy to overlook." an Austrian man in his 60s who once worked as a road manager for hard-rock bands now makes his living as a security guard at the museum. A tolerant philosophical fellow he muses (in voice-over narration) on both the artworks and the tourists and schoolchildren who shuffle past them finding the spectacle of spectatorship endlessly interesting." Johann meets Anne (Mary Margaret O�۪Hara) a Canadian woman who has come to Vienna to sit at the bedside of a cousin who is in a coma at a local hospital. Johann serves as Anne�۪s interpreter and advocate in her dealings with the medical authorities and also becomes her impromptu tour guide. Together they visit some of Vienna�۪s famous sites and also some of its workaday cafes and bars. They drink beer talk about their lives and develop a connection that while apparently not sexual (Johann is gay) is nonetheless deeply romantic." a New York filmmaker and video artist with an eye for rough urban landscapes and eccentric artistic characters is a patient observer and a cunning subtle storyteller. ���Museum Hours�۝ seems to wander and ruminate collecting stray moments and fleeting impressions that gradually ��� and perhaps only in retrospect ��� snap together to reveal an intriguing pattern of emotion and significance. Watching the film is not really like looking at a painting but the way the art historian looks at Bruegel has something in common with the way Mr. Cohen instructs us to pay attention to the world." its gallery-strolling focus is on those Dutch and Flemish paintings from the early modern period that turned ordinary faces and everyday events into subjects for exalted artistic scrutiny. The movie by visual example rather than thematic argument shows that this impulse is still very much alive. A modern city or a middle-aged face can be regarded with Rembrandt-like sympathy or Bruegelesque curiosity through a camera or a pair of eyes. This movie is rigorously and intensely lifelike which is to say that it�۪s also a strange and moving work of art."

The Dominica-born writer Jean Rhys preferred the word soucriant." �۝ a woman says in Rhys�۪s novel ���Wide Sargasso Sea �۝ which may be where the playwright-turned-screenwriter Moira Buffini first read it.

It�۪s obvious enough how Ms. McCarthy and Ms. Bullock fit into this taxonomy since Ms. McCarthy has already served as the Galifianakis to Jason Bateman�۪s Bateman in ���Identity Thief.�۝ It might however be noted that Ms. Bullock made her name as something of a Galifianakis to Keanu Reeves�۪s Bateman in ���Speed.�۝ But this is getting much too academic." an F.B.I. hotshot whose supreme competence and extreme arrogance rub her co-workers the wrong way. Her boss (Demian Bichir) thinks these qualities might stand in the way of a promotion and sends her to Boston to see if she can work with others in a case that shares jurisdiction with the local police department. Ashburn�۪s experiences in early scenes efficiently set up a theme that will be revisited throughout ���The Heat �۝ which is the routine sexism that women must contend with in professional situations. Though Ashburn is smarter than her colleagues she still has to endure their overt condescension and thinly veiled resentment. ���No wonder she�۪s single �۝ one of them sneers after she�۪s just shown up a room full of men by finding hidden drugs and guns that had eluded them." she reveals that she was once married. ���Was he a hearing man?�۝ Detective Shannon Mullins (Ms. McCarthy) wonders aloud. By then Mullins and Ashburn are acting out their own quasi-marital drama of clashing temperaments and contrasting physiognomies." a tornado of aggression whose favorite idioms are both anatomically precise and anatomically impossible terrorizes suspects and supervisors alike. When she finds Ashburn interviewing one of her collars she erupts into the fury that is her default setting. But of course the two of them end up working together to bring down a drug kingpin and learning more or less to appreciate each other." this transaction would involve the discovery of a middle ground: the unruly partner would learn the value of restraint while the uptight one would loosen up. But that isn�۪t quite what happens here since the film (written by Katie Dippold) and the audience are consistently on Mullins�۪s side. Yes her hygiene is questionable and her manners less than polished but she is otherwise a role model her brash sexual and professional self-confidence a perpetual rebuke to the insecurity that lurks behind Ashburn�۪s buttoned-up competitiveness." who has shown sweetness on ���Mike & Molly�۝ and over-the-top mania just about everywhere else since ���Bridesmaids �۝ is a verbal and physical dynamo. She evokes performers of the past ��� male and female slender and portly Gleasonesque Stoogelike and Burnettian ��� but scrambles their influences along with her own peculiar quickness and grace into something fresh and unpredictable." perhaps she will find a fitting feature-length showcase for her gifts. ���The Heat �۝ while it provides her with a serviceable scaffolding is not a very good movie. Its script is a rehash of the obvious and the pointless without the knowing self-mockery of ���21 Jump Street.�۝ And it suffers from the familiar crippling desire to be naughty without risking offense. So there are jokes at the expense of albinos and people with Boston accents ��� ���You a narc?�۝ one of Mullins�۪s brothers asks Ashburn but of course she doesn�۪t understand him because he doesn�۪t pronounce the ���r�۝ and she hasn�۪t seen ���Ted �۝ ���The Departed�۝ or ���Good Will Hunting�۝ ��� and halfhearted race- and class-based gags." some gunshots and explosions and an emergency tracheotomy that seems to want to match the diarrhea scene in ���Bridesmaids�۝ for gross hilarity. (Surgery oddly enough is not as funny as scatology.) A fairly standard summertime R-rated comedy in other words which I guess could be described as a kind of progress."

�۝ the pungent queasy-making screen adaptation of Neil LaBute�۪s play about a smug opportunistic cad delivers the same message as Cole Porter�۪s jaunty show tune ���Most Gentlemen Don�۪t Like Love.�۝ What they do like Porter joked is ���to kick it around.�۝ But in addressing male callousness the movie�۪s attitude isn�۪t so lightheartedly blas̩." played by Adam Brody is a handsome and polished New York-based fiction writer in his early 30s who is about to marry. The story tracks him as he embarks on a national farewell tour during which he reunites with old girlfriends hoping to make amends for past bad behavior. At each stop ��� Seattle Chicago Boston and Los Angeles ��� he encounters varying degrees of rage and resentment from women he had abruptly walked out on and not contacted again." directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer (���Party Girl�۝) is set almost entirely in hotel rooms where these attempts at friendly closure are conducted like interviews.

In Chicago he meets Tyler (M�_a Maestro) a siren who puts the moves on him by seductively blowing cigarette smoke into his mouth. He barely resists her wiles." you may still be willing to withhold judgment. But his encounter in Boston with Lindsay (Emily Watson) an older married college professor with whom he had an affair is another matter. The man he cuckolded and who caught them in bed was his academic mentor. Rather than face the consequences he fled leaving Lindsay to whom he had made lofty promises to deal with the consequences." her character tries to exact a revenge that is so preposterous that it throws a monkey wrench into a movie that never fully regains its balance. It recovers some stability when our antihero back in Seattle summons Reggie (Zoe Kazan) the younger sister of his high school best friend. Reggie�۪s character is not in the original play. On the eve of her 12th birthday she recalls he kissed her touched her inappropriately and whispered that he would marry her someday. He was 16. Ms. Kazan gives a compelling portrait of a woman still wrestling with the theft of her innocence; her face registers the conflicting emotions of the still-confused girl inside her wounded grown-up self." the tour�۪s final stop is where he meets Bobbi (Kristen Bell) the closest any woman has come to being his true love. During this meeting in which she labels him an ���emotional terrorist �۝ the screenplay throws in a zinger that reveals the extent of his narcissism and misogyny. I won�۪t give it away except to say that it is foreshadowed by a mention of his recent magazine story ���The Calculus of Desire �۝ in which several of the women recognized themselves." Ben Brantley described the play as having the ���formulaic precision of a scientific experiment.�۝ That assessment applies not only to Mr. LaBute�۪s manipulation of his characters in play after play but also to his manipulation of the audience by dispensing the dramatic equivalent of tidbits of scurrilous gossip to make you gasp." ���In the Company of Men �۝ in which two male business associates contrive an elaborate and vicious practical joke on a female colleague simply for sport. There are a lot of truthful notes in ���Some Girl(s) �۝ but there are also false ones that let you know that you are being played with. You�۪d best beware."

Ash Christian (who also directed) and Theresa Bennett every problem comes down to sex. The parents don�۪t have it and their sons have either too much of it or not enough.

�۝ a civil servant who�۪s reproached for his punctuation realizes that he has never used an exclamation mark in his 40 years of service. ���This unconscious orthography of yours is a reflex it�۪s completely worthless �۝ his accuser coolly concludes. ���A mechanical activity and nothing more.�۝ The same charge can be levied against the punctuation that hopefully caps the title of Pedro Almod�_var�۪s ���I�۪m So Excited!�۝; worse yet the same can be said of this airless uninvolving movie." it opens promisingly with a disclaimer that the movie bears no relation to reality and with playful cameos from Pen̩lope Cruz and Antonio Banderas as airport workers. Regrettably these two turn out to be just the warm-up act and after some runway slapstick and a seemingly ritualistic nod to Hitchcock�۪s ���Vertigo �۝ the focus shifts inside Peninsula Flight 2549 which is set to fly from Madrid to Mexico City. It takes off just fine. But because of technical malfunction the plane ��� in what becomes a regrettably apt increasingly awkward metaphor for the movie itself ��� is soon circling above nearby Toledo going nowhere fast." pretty bits out including the three campy vampy attendants (Javier C��mara Carlos Areces Ra̼l Ar̩valo) in business class where most of the story unwinds. The hordes in steerage have been drugged to manage the stress of ���economy class syndrome �۝ a condition that in addition to being funny (and true) limits the awake passengers to the six in business class. These are newlyweds (Miguel ́ngel Silvestre and Laya Mart�_); a banker Mr. M��s (Jos̩ Luis Torrijo); an actor Ricardo (Guillermo Toledo) juggling several grounded lovers; a mustachioed mystery man Infante (Jos̩ Mar�_a Yazpik); and this being Almod�_var a famous dominatrix Norma (Cecilia Roth)." a self-described psychic and virgin Bruna (Lola Due̱as) wanders in from economy to join business class. There the frisky flight attendants rule the roost though for much of the time they mostly just mix and guzzle drinks gossip about everyone else and serve as a kind of bawdy sort of naughty progressively more belabored and unfunny gay Greek chorus. Every so often the focus shifts to the cockpit where the pilot Alex (Antonio de la Torre) and co-pilot Benito (Hugo Silva) in between fiddling with the instrument panel and talking to ground control throw back drinks trade sex talk and have trysts while everyone else runs in circles and the plane continues to go nowhere. Around and around they go or as Arthur Schnitzler would have put it ronde and ronde." partly because of the faith Mr. Almod�_var commands. There�۪s something reassuring for instance about the circularity that he introduces with both the ���Vertigo�۝ allusion (an image of the jet engine�۪s spinning blades) and the loops that the plane traces in the air. The circularity suggests a pattern which in turn suggests that as the story unwinds some larger point or meaning ��� narrative formal conceptual philosophical aesthetic ��� will emerge helping to make sense out of the busily whirring parts or at least yield a satisfying payoff. A movie may not make sense on first or even second viewing but what often matters to borrow an image from Mr. Almod�_var is the journey ��� not the destination." though the journey generally drags because the spinning characters with their tired jokes and familiar melodramas soon feel so mechanical like the automated parts in an Almod�_var machine. Now and again of course something does pop ��� a comical face a bright laugh a delightfully smutty joke the flowers splashed across the dress of one woman and the bright red painted on the trembling lips of another ��� but time and again they pop individually rather than forming a coherent sustaining gestalt. The dress and those lips appear courtesy of Blanca Su��rez and Paz Vega who seen in brief cutaways during some phone conversations let in some much-needed air offering glimpses of a world beyond a plane that has become a prison."

�۝ the latest conflagration from that master blaster Roland Emmerich is as demented and entertaining as promised and a little less idiotic than feared. Once again for reasons best left to him and his therapist he has created a pop diversion about the near-destruction of the world. Maybe he just likes playing with matches. Yet as you watch the White House go up in flames ��� an image that doesn�۪t provoke the same shock or giggles that it did in his 1996 flick ���Independence Day�۝ ��� you may wonder if every time he blows or burns something up Mr. Emmerich who was born in Germany in 1955 is compulsively repeating a historical trauma." nothing says summer studio fun like annihilating violence. That at any rate seems to be one lesson of recent movies like ���Star Trek Into Darkness �۝ ���Man of Steel �۝ ���World War Z�۝ and the bromantic ���This Is the End �۝ which bank on viewers grooving on the spectacle of their symbolic demise: bang bang ��� we�۪re all dead. The stakes don�۪t look initially global when soon after Mr. Emmerich�۪s movie opens the White House is overwhelmed by heavily armed men taking orders from a boilerplate maniac. (Scan the credits to guess who it is.) Like other bug-eyed brethren in patriotism from Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper in ���Dr. Strangelove�۝ to Gen. James Mattoon Scott in ���Seven Days in May �۝ this latest crazy believes that he can do better than the president." James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx serviceable) is African-American adds a frisson as does the conceit that he needs saving because he has a workable peace plan for the Middle East and powerful business interests don�۪t want to keep either him or hope alive. His savior ��� and as the movie industry clearly hopes that of the big-screen spectacle ��� is a white working-class hero John Cale (Channing Tatum). In one of those outrageous twists on which action movies are built John is serendipitously accompanying his cute adolescent scold Emily (Joey King) on a tour through the White House at the very moment it�۪s overrun. In between gunshots and explosions she pretends that her father isn�۪t the coolest ever while he races to save life as we know it." among other details a new cooperative Iranian president and a former intelligence whiz gone off the reservation ��� that Mr. Emmerich rapidly begins to demolish. There�۪s a satisfying bluntness to his expediency that complements Mr. Tatum�۪s guileless on-screen persona as he assumes the mantle or rather the sweat-stained white tank top once worn by Bruce Willis. Mr. Tatum not only wears the same shirt (passed down from Marlon Brando) but he also shares the first name and Everyman earthiness that turned Mr. Willis into a movie star with ���Die Hard.�۝ (Each character has a curly haired woman on the sidelines.) After years of importing British and Australian he-men Hollywood has another homegrown hero." Mr. Tatum has excellent timing ��� Mr. Willis is 58; Brad Pitt 49; Will Smith 44 ��� which is matched by that of his character who�۪s also interviewing for a Secret Service job with a snobby skeptic (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Well he shows her as he swats away villainy in a White House that�۪s conveniently short of effective guards and surveillance cameras and packed with valuable team players like James Woods Richard Jenkins Lance Reddick and the invaluable slow-boiler Jason Clarke. Whether Mr. Tatum is upstaging these inveterate scene savers and stealers or taking the presidential limousine out for a spin on the Great Lawn for a demolition derby that doubles as a Cadillac commercial he sells the role and himself with athletic grace and a star�۪s self-assured charm." meanwhile peddles the rest of the goods handily. He makes the opening siege unsettling enough to grab your attention and then once he has it begins folding in lighter moments ��� one-liners cartoonish bits of business laughably impossible situations and stunts ��� that ensure that at least this American collapse doesn�۪t end up feeling too heavy. At times his unabashed maximalist approach evokes the salesmanship of the television marketing genius Ron Popeil who liked to cap his overexcited pitches with the tagline ���But wait ��� there�۪s more!�۝ Like the Ronco Veg-O-Matic ���White House Down�۝ delivers more: more guns bigger guns rocket-propelled grenades surface-to-air missiles battle tanks Black Hawk helicopters nuclear-armed submarines and when the dust settles the customary climaxing fist-to-gut slugfest." ���White House Down�۝ ritualistically gestures toward peace even as the bodies bloodlessly fall. It�۪s as disingenuous as you might expect but it�۪s also a live-action cartoon ��� an Extreme Road Runner distraction that is finally as American as apple pie with a Velveeta wedge. Partly because the story is largely contained within the White House and its environs and even with those nukes pointing at Armageddon there�۪s a limit to how much large-scale damage Mr. Emmerich can mount. The spatial confines help keep the stakes and the vibe somewhat more intimate than in many action flicks which helps save him from indulging in one of those numbing finales that plague the genre. He gives it plenty of pow while Mr. Tatum provides the pulse." extreme gun violence explosions parent and child peril and the threat of a worldwide nuclear smack-down."

Such questions are toyed with clumsily in ���Redemption �۝ the splashy scatterbrained directorial debut of Steven Knight the screenwriter of David Cronenberg�۪s acclaimed crime thriller ���Eastern Promises.�۝" the movie is obliged to include a fair amount of ultraviolence to satisfy that star�۪s carnivorous fan base. The camera slavers over several gory scuffles in which Mr. Statham�۪s character Joey Jones a homeless drunken lout in London�۪s neo-Dickensian netherworld dispatches his enemies three or four at time using only his fists." where his misadventures as a special forces soldier left him traumatized and subject to hallucinatory flashbacks he stumbles into a piece of luck. After a street fight he breaks into the elegant apartment of a photographer who he discovers is away for the summer and makes it his temporary home. Assuming the photographer�۪s identity Joey dresses in his fancy clothes cleans up his act and takes a job as a waiter in a Chinese restaurant." and he is promoted to a lucrative job as enforcer for a Chinese mobster. Playing Robin Hood he lavishes Sister Cristina (Agata Buzek) a Polish nun who operates a neighborhood soup kitchen with ill-gotten riches. Cristina is one of three women who obsess him. The others barely seen include the bitterly angry mother of his 9-year-old daughter and a murdered prostitute and friend from the streets whose killer he tracks down." ���Redemption�۝ is a lot like its antihero in his borrowed wardrobe. But its narrative continuity is so sketchy and the screenplay so haphazard that the movie doesn�۪t add up to more than trash seasoned with pretentious religiosity." graphic nudity and language."

Bobby on bass David on guitar) probably needed that unity as young black men playing hard-rocking ���white boy music�۝ at an R&B moment. Their nearly forgotten existence excited fans in the late 2000s when their self-published singles resurfaced long after the brothers had moved on with families and new music and David the band�۪s creative but troubled leader had died. But ���A Band Called Death�۝ is more concerned with bringing out the personal connections behind their driven music than with insisting upon the group�۪s distinction in the perennial music history search for oddities and firsts." bringing the film�۪s narrative full circle. Although the hovering-through-photographs special effect might be a tad overused here the interviews with the Hackneys are shot slightly from below in a way that brings out their inner glow. Their story can feel almost too ready-made for the telling but it�۪s well worth a listen."

�۝ the Australian brothers Colin and Cameron Cairnes break plenty of bones but no new ground in the camp-horror genre. Yet this fairly rote tale of rural ghouls and their passing-through prey has its own hick charm mostly because of performers who never overplay their hands." that is as not all the actors make it to the end of the movie with a full complement of limbs. For that we can blame the fertilizer kings Reg and Lindsay Morgan (Damon Herriman and Angus Sampson) whose popular blood-and-bone product contains a secret ingredient. Up to now these composting geniuses have settled for random roadkill ��� a kangaroo here an accident victim there ��� but pickings are slim. So when Reg happens upon three young travelers whose car has broken down he decides it�۪s time to be proactive." this comedy of errors charges from the Morgan barn where the rattle and hum of a whole-body mulcher awaits our three prisoners to a variety of scrubby outdoor locations. Anna McGahan shines as a coquettish captive trying to woo the simple-minded and improbably squeamish Reg while Mr. Sampson gives the monstrous Lindsay a brutish single-mindedness. Lindsay may suffer from what his decrepit Aunt Nancy describes as ���an anger thingy �۝ but it�۪s his thing for Aunt Nancy that provokes the film�۪s most disgusting scene. Even that vat of noxious slurry idling in the barn is easier on the eyes."

the Canadian singer-songwriter Kate McGarrigle left behind a trove of wonderful songs and recordings most of them made with her sister Anna. Among the other musical gifts she passed on to later generations are her children Martha and Rufus Wainwright who possess two of the most beautiful voices in the world. It may be enough to say that ���Sing Me the Songs That Say I Love You �۝ Lian Lunson�۪s new documentary weaves together these strands of McGariggle�۪s musical legacy as her son and daughter perform a selection of their mother�۪s work." which records a May 2011 memorial concert at Town Hall in New York includes some other voices as well. The talk-show host Jimmy Fallon does a jaunty sweet rendition of ���Swimming Song.�۝ Emmylou Harris Norah Jones and Krystle Warren are in fine form and Justin Vivian Bond electrifies the room with a performance of ���The Work Song.�۝ Anna and various nieces and nephews are on hand but this is very much Rufus and Martha�۪s show. They provide vocal and physical reminders of Kate ��� you can hear and see her genetic imprint whenever they are on screen ��� even as they mourn her absence." disappointment nostalgia and affection and some songs written decades ago seem almost to have been written expressly for a concert like this one.  ���Walking Song �۝  a hymn to companionship takes on a haunting metaphorical resonance when played as an elegy. But the McGarrigles always filtered the pain of experience through a witty stoical sensibility. The literary richness of their lyrics is matched by a musical approach that mixes the tough simplicity of North American folk traditions with the urbanity of the Gershwins and Stephen Sondheim." but Ms. Lunson�۪s film makes a strong case that they belong near the top of the post-�۪60s pop pantheon. As a musical experience it is generous and moving. But as a documentary ���Sing Me the Songs�۝ is an awkward hybrid of concert film and rock-star biography. The emotional power of the musical performances is augmented by interviews with Anna and with Rufus and Martha Wainwright but the scarcity of information about Kate�۪s life can be frustrating." but that are nonetheless capable of being confused. Rufus and Martha are eager to share their mother but also intent on protecting her. There is both too much information here and too little: we see painful deathbed photographs but hear barely a word about Kate McGarrigle�۪s childhood or other experiences that might illuminate our understanding of her art. Figures in old snapshots are not identified and Loudon Wainwright III Rufus and Martha�۪s father (and the author of ���Swimming Song�۝) is mentioned only once late and in passing." a perfectly reasonable choice that would have been more coherent without the cursory gestures in the direction of more complete portraiture. Kate McGarrigle�۪s family knew her well and loved her greatly as did her fans though in necessarily different ways. This film honors both of those facts even as perhaps unwittingly it measures the distance between them."

You can make this amount of money a day by selling cocaine we�۪re told and soon you�۪ll go from chump to millionaire." laced with juicy detail about illegal practices starts out as a smart tactic: it nudges the average nondealing viewer to think for a moment that drug dealing isn�۪t just something done by other unsavory people.

Those veterans include Curtis Jackson better known as 50 Cent; a rumpled ex-coke dealer; and the convicted Los Angeles kingpin Freeway Rick Ross." from its Nixon-era inception as a national policy to its costly maintenance casualties and hypocrisies.

And in many ways when compared with ���Man of Steel �۝ ���Iron Man 3�۝ and ���Star Trek: OMG Ricardo Montalb��n! �۝ ���World War Z�۝ is pretty refreshing." loosely adapted from Max Brooks�۪s 2006 novel of the same title is under two hours long. Its action set pieces are cleverly conceived and coherently executed in ways that make them feel surprising even exciting. Brad Pitt playing a former United Nations troubleshooter pressed back into service to battle the undead wears a scruffy Redfordesque air of pained puzzlement. And best of all ���World War Z �۝ directed by Marc Forster from a script with four credited authors reverses the relentless can-we-top-this structure that makes even smart blockbusters feel bloated and dumb. The large-scale city-destroying sequences come early leading toward a climax that is intimate intricate and genuinely suspenseful." �۝ it was published at an earlier moment in the long zombie march through modern popular culture." and to ���The Walking Dead�۝ in both its graphic novel and cable television versions Mr. Forster�۪s film represents a careful step backward. It does not expand the tonal range of zombie fantasy like Ruben Fleischer�۪s ���Zombieland�۝ or Colson Whitehead�۪s novel ���Zone One.�۝ Nor does it exploit the allegorical potential of a world overrun by flesh-craving half-decayed former people in the manner of ���The Walking Dead �۝ which turns the desolate post-apocalyptic landscape into a forum for philosophical debate and ethical inquiry." �۝ in other words does not try to extend the boundaries of commercial entertainment but does what it can to find interesting ways to pass the time within them. It starts with a flurry of images establishing that we are in a familiar world of global anxiety and media distraction as news reports about environmental and medical problems alternate with bits of celebrity gossip. Gerry Lane (Mr. Pitt) takes all this in while making breakfast for his wife (Mireille Enos) and their daughters (Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove) in the family�۪s Philadelphia home." during the drive to school the City of Brotherly Love is rocked by explosions and suddenly full of lurching screeching creatures who smash their heads through car windows and start gnawing the people inside who turn into ... but by now you know the routine. Like their brethren in video games and other movies these Z-folk are fast-moving and hard to kill though we and Gerry eventually learn the traits that distinguish them from the rest. They are inflamed by loud noises and move in terrifying swarms their individuality completely swallowed by the blind ravenous will of the virus that infects them." �۝ both in its impact and its efficiency. Mr. Forster whose previous films include ���Monster�۪s Ball �۝ ���Finding Neverland�۝ and the James Bond installment ���Quantum of Solace �۝ is more of a craftsman than a visionary which is something of a relief in this age of action movie grandiosity. ���World War Z�۝ often feels smaller and quieter than it is because your attention is drawn to details and moments rather than to showstopping spectacles or self-important themes." Gerry and his family are helicoptered to an aircraft carrier where Gerry�۪s former boss (Fana Mokoena) has an offer that can�۪t be refused. In exchange for the safety of his loved ones ��� and at the cost of a severe reduction of Ms. Enos�۪s screen time and expressive range ��� Gerry must travel the world in search of the virus�۪s origin and possible cure." David Morse Peter Capaldi Ruth Negga Moritz Bleibtreu ��� in locations from South Korea to Jerusalem to Wales. Along the way Gerry loses and acquires potential sidekicks the most durable of whom is a tough Israeli soldier (Daniella Kertesz) whose tiny frame and close-shorn hair contrast pleasingly with Mr. Pitt�۪s burly bemaned look." though the movie doesn�۪t quite meet the challenge of making them seem truly new or scary. But if you want to be diverted and mildly disturbed they and ���World War Z �۝ will at least temporarily satisfy your appetite. And of course they would feel the same about you."

Her unexplained weeping and the ill-defined backdrop make an apt start for this intelligent involving movie that�۪s by turns a murder mystery and a politically charged argument about contemporary Palestinian identity. That it�۪s also about a troubled marriage becomes evident when the man a successful Palestinian surgeon living and working in Tel Aviv is awoken one night and discovers that both his wife and his safe cosseted world have disappeared after a suicide bombing." at least as far as he�۪s concerned the surgeon Amin (Ali Suliman) has risen high in his field progress that has come with the support of his Jewish colleagues. One token of his success is an Israeli award he accepts soon after the story opens the first ��� as he lightly reminds his audience ��� given to an Arab in 41 years. If he�۪s fazed by this he doesn�۪t say; mostly he seems gratified and happy. Whether he means anything substantial by this seemingly casual nod at the past ��� specifically the 1970s an era of spectacular terrorist attacks like that of the Palestinian group Black September on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics ��� it subtly and necessarily widens the movie�۪s historical framework." it�۪s a fair guess that he knows the effect raising the past will have. (The movie which is neither pro- nor anti-Israel has been banned in Lebanon.) The genesis for the movie is a 2005 novel of the same title by Yasmina Khadra the pen name of Mohammed Moulessehoul a former Algerian army officer living in France. The movie written by Mr. Doueiri and his wife Jo��lle Touma retains much of what�۪s good in the book including Amin�۪s forced confrontation with the past which begins the night he�۪s called back to the hospital where he works. Minutes later he is standing in a morgue and pulling a sheet off the mangled corpse of his wife Siham (Reymonde Amsellem)." led by the bullet-headed Captain Moshe (Uri Gavriel) believe that Siham was a suicide bomber whose stealth attack on a restaurant left nearly a dozen children dead.

���Man of Steel�۝ will turn on everyone it doesn�۪t turn off. Summer blockbusters have a way of encouraging multiplex Manichaeism though I propose a middle way. It won�۪t be easy. Even those who patiently ride out the bludgeoning excesses of the film�۪s final 45 minutes may wonder what happened to the movie ��� the one about human and humanoid struggles ��� they watched for the first 100. They may also wonder why no one anyone smacked the director Zack Snyder in the head and reminded him that he was midwifing a superhero franchise as the film�۪s first image of a yelling straining woman signals not restaging the end of days." Apocalypse Then: The 21st century has been tough for Superman at least at the box office. After decades of saving the world on the screen and on the page the movie character seemed stuck particularly after the dreary 2006 reboot ���Superman Returns.�۝ The Superman story had been told in so many ways and in so many moods in the comics ��� he has married and mourned died and been reborn ��� but shaping these transformative cycles into a new film much less a viable series remained elusive. Christopher Nolan went dark and then darker with another DC Comics legend in the Dark Knight films but this was Superman idealism embodied. What was there left to say about the man in the primary-color suit especially after Sept. 11?" return to basics and add a fighting-trim Russell Crowe a howlingly mad Michael Shannon that emotional guidepost Amy Adams and a superdude ��� the British actor Henry Cavill ��� so ripped that he�۪s nearly shredded. Much like ���Batman Begins �۝ the first part of the Dark Knight trilogy ���Man of Steel�۝ narrates the how and why of its character tracing an existential arc from child to man. The difference is that while Batman has to journey into the world (with a layover in a bat cave) to acquire his particular skill set Superman comes fully loaded. He just needs to burrow into his innermost self hang out at the Fortress of Solitude and meet the right woman." �۝ which was written by David S. Goyer from a story that he created with Mr. Nolan that extracts the canonical account from 75 years of seemingly infinitely layered supermythology. To that end the film begins at the beginning back on Krypton where Jor-El (Mr. Crowe) attempts to persuade its council wearing dour expressions and ornate headdresses evocative of Gothic tracery that their planet is doomed. It�۪s a measure of the film�۪s striking design here that the headdress latticework is echoed in some of the pleated clothing as well as in the curvilinear buildings suggesting that someone behind the scenes (the production designer is Alex McDowell) is an admirer of the architect Zaha Hadid and her flowing organic forms." adding to this alien world�۪s striking conceptual unity. Lovely and imperious the headdresses are also emblems of the countervailing forces that have led to the ruin of Krypton a civilization undone by its own advances. The resemblances to Earth are blunt enough for an eco-savvy kindergartner and pop off the screen like speech balloons. But then this is Superman and Mr. Snyder whose earlier movies include a stillborn adaptation of the graphic novel ���Watchmen �۝ is here playing with different narrative forms as he toggles between cinematic realism and the kind of comic-book-style exaggeration that distills ideas into images." who�۪s given the name Kal-El opens the film and precedes Krypton�۪s end. Jor-El and his wife Lara Lor-Van (the Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer) decide to rocket their child to Earth sending him off to safety in the futuristic equivalent of Moses�۪ basket. Given that Superman�۪s creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were Jewish much has been written about Superman�۪s similarities to Moses (���el�۝ is a Hebrew word for God) which is complicated by the character�۪s likeness to Jesus. (Superman�۪s Earth mom was originally named Mary.) Mr. Snyder with his characteristic lack of subtlety hits the Jesus angle amusingly hard primarily in a later scene in which Superman ��� framed by a stained-glass tableau of a supplicating Jesus draped in a red robe ��� consults with a priest in a church. By then the rocketing baby has become the man and given a soul-sick mien. That�۪s because the next time you see Kal-El after liftoff he�۪s all grown up and toiling on a fishing boat off the northwest Canadian coast a filmic ellipsis that abruptly spans decades. A beat later and he�۪s also shirtless and holding back a tower wobbling on a burning oil platform. And then like Hercules who rises from his funeral pyre ��� having cast off his mortal body and assumed his godly form ��� Superman a k a Clark Kent is engulfed in flames. It�۪s a nifty startling image even if it transforms Mr. Cavill a pretty man whose body has been inflated to Bluto-esque proportions into barbecue beefcake. Mr. Snyder perhaps intuiting how fast this image could slip away from him cuts his way out of there fast." the oil platform is most notable for the workingmen Superman rescues laboring brothers to the trapped coal miners who figure into one of his first comic-book outings in 1938. One of the pleasures of the Christopher Reeve ���Superman�۝ series which took off in 1978 and bottomed out in 1987 was how the movies managed to be both charmingly old-fashioned and of their contemporary moment. There are a number of overt references to the past in ���Man of Steel �۝ a title that itself summons up America�۪s lost industrial history. There�۪s even a scene in which Jor-El narrates Krypton�۪s rise and calamitous fall using immersive metallic-gray images that morph and scroll across the frame like an animated version of a W.P.A. bas-relief mural." or the running time of an average movie Mr. Snyder is in control of his material. His handling of the story�۪s many flashbacks which fill in piecemeal Superman�۪s Kansas childhood as Clark is fluid and apt. Each return to the past becomes another tile in the mosaic adding to the emerging portrait of the adult wanderer and seeker he has become. His adoptive parents Martha (Diane Lane) and Jonathan (Kevin Costner) come into focus as does the bewildered child (played by Cooper Timberline and Dylan Sprayberry) who doesn�۪t understand why he�۪s so different. Mr. Snyder borrows too many canted camera angles and too much sun-kissed fluttering laundry from Terrence Malick but the Kansas scenes solidify the human foundation of a divided identity." a schism that evokes other familiar God-human divides.

In his excellent 1987 essay ���What Makes Superman So Darned American �۝ Gary D. Engle wrote that ���Superman raises the American immigrant experience to the level of religious myth.�۝ Mr. Snyder isn�۪t capable of mythmaking but in his sometimes poetic sometimes crude way he has given Superman a new lease on franchise life by affirming that this most American hero is also an alien yearning to breathe free." alien battles and annihilated worlds."

The assassins use curved swords to lob these portable guillotines lacrosse-style mowing down the opposition with terminal efficiency. Although Mr. Lau and the special-effects team linger over the spinning blades with near fetishistic longing there�۪s also a suitably disturbing undertow to these spinning apparatuses." the guillotines introduce a mechanical aspect to killing opening up a physical and moral distance between executioners and executed that ensuing technologies of death will widen. This theme surfaces when the squad while trying to capture a popular rebel leader a Jesus or maybe Mao-like figure called Wolf (Huang Xiaoming) faces an unexpected threat: a new emperor-sanctioned patrol armed with guns. The emperor determined to secure his place in history and casting an eye at the cannons of the encroaching West has decided that blade-chucking killers may not be the most flattering examples of his legacy." he sends out a trusted aide Du (Shawn Yue) to accompany their mutual childhood friend and the leader of the Guillotines Leng (Ethan Juan) on the pack�۪s Wolf hunt. What none of the Guillotines know at least initially is that after Wolf has been bagged the Guillotines will be next on the chopping block. The energetic Mr. Lau does what he can with the messy story but despite some glorious locations a cast of seemingly (real human rather than digital) thousands and a provocative historical frame the incrementally served up pieces never satisfactorily cohere. The blades fly as do the heads but the movie remains disappointingly aground."

Tom Carroll was a two-time world champion in the 1980s and Ross Clarke-Jones his friend from the tour is a tow-in pioneer. We�۪re a long way from two buds and their boards here: backed by a support team that includes a forecaster local surfers charter boats the occasional helicopter and a platoon of cinematographers the pair spend a winter (May through August mate) stalking the biggest storms down under and conquering the waves they bring. It all builds to a trip to a shoal almost 50 miles from the coast of Western Australia that has rarely been visited let alone surfed." the waves fearsome the filming often amazing. Additionally the story of Tom and Ross confronting their limits ��� Tom almost 50 warily assesses the risks of the massive surf while Ross in his mid-40s remains in enthusiastic denial ��� lends a needed heft. The 3-D effects are minimal though mainly tossing sea spray at the audience. Better footage comes from cameras embedded in the surfboards or held aloft. When Tom wipes out or feels the side of the pipeline he�۪s shooting through it�۪s as close as a viewer can get to riding a wave no wet suit or sunscreen required. ���Storm Surfers 3D�۝ revels in its high-tech ways but works best when it focuses on the sport�۪s simplest pleasures."

albeit one filled with screams. In this affectionate film by Peter Strickland about the dubbing production for a 1970s horror film in Italy a timid British engineer toils at mixing perfect sound for a shriek (or an impalement). But as the sonic violence takes its toll on him the film�۪s culture-clash humor gives way to an uncanny fuguelike seepage between reality and artifice." Gilderoy who is played by Toby Jones with the most minute (and amusing) grades of expressive reserve is his cheerfully stereotyped Italian bosses. Francesco (Cosimo Fusco) and Santini (Antonio Mancino) respect his skills but also toy with him a bit and they�۪re none too easy on the female professional screamers either." and Mr. Strickland loves it too. The camera gives gear-head close-ups of analog equipment and observes the facial contortions of dubbers imitating witches nuns and goblins. Repeated images of the fruits and vegetable debris from producing the sound effects become like memento mori. The production Gilderoy is working on is titled ���The Equestrian Vortex �۝ a homage (along with the soundtrack) to the evocative yet unwieldy titles of Italian horror and giallo films." and what we really witness and feel is Gilderoy�۪s strange trip rather than ���The Equestrian Vortex.�۝ Between production fiascos and letters from dear old mum Mr. Strickland bridges scenes with sounds shadowy pans or blackouts instead of hard cuts. The effect is one of drifting through the unquiet corridors of Gilderoy�۪s mind." though its milieu is too engagingly recreated to dismiss. Ultimately it�۪s not unlike many of Mr. Strickland�۪s beloved Italian films which could be superb exercises in cinematic style and atmosphere while remaining imperfect."

Stephen Dorff�۪s drifting movie star and Kirsten Dunst�۪s capricious young queen both lead pampered existences of a kind that make them easy objects of envy and resentment but Ms. Coppola examines them with detached quiet sympathy refusing to mock or judge. She anatomizes the spiritual conditions of people who might have seemed to be case studies in shallow carefree materialism." �۝ her new feature (and her fifth over all) continues in this vein from a somewhat different perspective. It is not about the paralysis of having more than you could possibly want but rather about the addictive thrills of wanting what you can�۪t quite have and trying to get it. The Southern California teenagers at the center of the movie do not reside in a bubble of money and celebrity though they are not exactly outsiders either.

There is a whiff of tabloid incredulity in Ms. Coppola�۪s version of the story and an occasional crackle of appalled satire. Once the main characters are caught the explanations they offer are at least as disturbing as the crimes themselves. Nicki the meanest and most ambitious of the group views the whole experience as ���a learning lesson�۝ that will ultimately help her achieve her goal of leading a major philanthropic organization or ���a country for all I know.�۝ For his part Marc vaguely blames his low self-esteem (he�۪s ���not ugly �۝ but also ���not A-list�۝) and society�۪s obsession with Bonnie-and-Clyde-style outlaws." and it is often easy to laugh at the blas̩ attitudes and clueless expressions of the teenage burglars. But ���The Bling Ring�۝ is finally neither a cautionary tale of youth gone wrong nor a joke at the expense of kids these days. Although Rebecca Marc and Chloe may be shallow and amoral (Nicki seems more like a true sociopath) they are also acting in the grip of a genuine aesthetic compulsion feeding an appetite for beauty and intensity that is hardly theirs alone." she does take it seriously. The film shot by Christopher Blauvelt and the great cinematographer Harris Savides (to whose memory it is dedicated) has a quiet sensual glow that communicates the lust that drives its characters.

�۝ Morgan Neville�۪s new documentary is Lou Reed�۪s ���Walk on the Wild Side �۝ a provocative choice and also an appropriate one. The notorious lyrics of the chorus ��� ���and the colored girls sing/doo da-doo da-doo doo doo doo doo ... �۝ ��� establish the movie�۪s subject and also its reason for being. This generous fascinating documentary about the careers of backup singers most of them African-American women seeks to rewrite the history of pop music by focusing attention on voices at once marginal and vital." who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011 most of the vocalists interviewed on screen are not well known even though they can be heard on many of the most popular and durable recordings of the past half-century. Ms. Love who did not receive proper credit for her singing on a number of Phil Spector-produced hits of the �۪60s worked as a house cleaner before claiming a rightful place in the spotlight in more recent decades." ambition and prejudice that keeps some hugely talented musicians in the shadows while others perhaps less gifted become big stars." like Sting Bruce Springsteen and Mick Jagger. Their praise of the backup singers they�۪ve worked with is sincere and insightful but their presence also emphasizes the gender and racial imbalances that are as deeply ingrained in popular music as bass guitar and drums." the give-and-take between the lead vocalist and the supporting chorus has its roots in the call-and-response of the black church where most of the singers in the movie started out. Many of them are the daughters of preachers and one Dr. Mable John has come full circle. A former Raelette who oohed and aahed alongside Ray Charles she is now a pastor and the founder of the Joy in Jesus Ministries in Los Angeles." the music business ��� and also a series of tales of professional commitment and artistic triumph. The picture it paints is gratifyingly complicated. Some singers who came up in the highly disciplined rhythm-and-blues milieu of the 1960s felt liberated when white rock acts like the Rolling Stones came along and encouraged them to be as more than one pointedly puts it ���blacker.�۝" pregnant and with her hair in curlers to record an incendiary vocal track on ���Gimme Shelter.�۝ Claudia Lennear was an integral part of the Stones�۪ shows in the early �۪70s as Lisa Fischer a singer of truly prodigious range and delicacy has been since 1989." �۝ a song whose Southern-pride message she found more than a little alienating. Her account of how the presence of her voice subverts some of the political intentions of the record is almost convincing. But her performance of Neil Young�۪s ���Southern Man �۝ captured on a television broadcast sometime in the �۪70s is a revelation. Backed by a funk band and sporting a cloud of ���natural�۝ hair she turns Mr. Young�۪s earnest scolding indictment of Southern racism (which partly provoked Lynyrd Skynyrd�۪s defensive anthem) into a tour de force of rage passion and defiant virtuosity. You see how a singer can transform a song." �۝ which invites you to listen with new ears to songs you thought you knew including David Bowie�۪s ���Young Americans�۝ and some of Sting�۪s recent work. The film is more about spirit than about technique which is understandable but also perhaps a bit disappointing. The human voice is a mysterious powerful instrument and it would be good to learn more about its secrets from those who have mastered them. But in the end the demonstration of that mastery may be more satisfying than the analysis of it and matching new faces to voices we already know is a gift for music fans."

But the allegorical significance of ���This Is the End�۝ may lie closer to home in the creative exhaustion of its makers and the popular profitable strain of humor they represent.

Why shouldn�۪t it be? It assembles a talented quick-tongued bunch of performers and happily dispenses with the pretense that they are playing anything other than themselves. The fake-doc aesthetic that rules so much television these days is used to witty effect as we are invited to hang out with Mr. Rogen James Franco and some other famous pals whose lives turn out to be exactly what we might have expected based on some of their earlier movies." which kind of bothers Jay (Baruchel) who has come to California to visit Seth. Their friendship stretches back to younger days in Canada and Jay doesn�۪t really get along with the Hollywood crowd Seth has been running with since his career took flight under the wing of Judd Apatow.

There�۪s Rihanna! And Paul Rudd! Jason Segel! Michael Cera!" who along with Jay Seth and James make up a hardy band of survivors when the divine wrath really hits the fan. They are joined eventually by Danny (McBride) and Emma (Watson) who is around long enough to make you realize that the Harry Potter movies were basically a British version of ���Freaks and Geeks�۝ and to raise a question that has been burning up the Internet for years: can rape jokes ever be funny?" and as crude as the movie�۪s humor often is its spirit is sweet sensitive and innocuous. In their script for ���Superbad �۝ Mr. Rogen and Mr. Goldberg zeroed in on the tenderness and vulnerability that lie at the heart of male friendship and here they go even further using the prospect of global annihilation as an occasion for some touchy-feely relationship workshopping." which is as literal a deus ex machina as you could wish for ��� is Jay�۪s jealousy. He resents Seth�۪s new friends and perhaps also his greater success. Once the two of them are locked in James�۪s gaudy modernist Hollywood mansion this issue continues to simmer and is intensified by the personality quirks of the other survivors. Craig�۪s moodiness Jonah�۪s passive-aggressive tendencies James�۪s arrogance and Danny�۪s jovial lack of consideration cause friction that is notwithstanding the fireballs and murderous demons quite realistic. So in a way are the squabbles that ensue including an angry debate between James and Danny on the ethics of ejaculating on someone else�۪s stuff." Y-chromosome-endowed actors and comedians these days. But a deeper and more troubling metaphor may be the house itself which represents the limitations of an insular exclusive and increasingly self-cannibalizing comic imagination. The problem is not that Seth and Jay and the rest are still rolling joints and trying out naughty material on one another in the comfort of their ever-larger and plusher homes. The problem is that they seem to be motivated more and more by professional duty and brand awareness. Solipsism has turned into shtick and their childish interest in themselves betrays a confining lack of curiosity about anything else." and ���This Is the End�۝ is both a protest against and an acknowledgment of this reality. Mr. Rogen and Mr. Goldberg ��� and their on-screen co-conspirators and alter egos ��� would rather blow up the whole world than grapple with the existence of women children death politics responsibility homosexuality and other fertile subjects for laughter. But I�۪m confident that eventually they will deal with all of it. They�۪re good boys much as they like to pretend otherwise."

Mr. Imhoof is descended from a long line of beekeepers whose cultivation of bees and harvesting of their honey are still carried out in more or less traditional ways. The film approvingly contrasts Mr. Imhoof�۪s family tradition with the techniques of modern agribusiness in which bee colonies are trucked from place to place to pollinate enormous orchards." by J̦rg Jeshel is spectacularly beautiful whether the camera is contemplating the Swiss Alps or the interior of a hive where bees are observed in enlarged close-up. But the film goes overboard with cartoonish slow-motion footage of bees in flight." a state that produces up to 80 percent of the world�۪s almonds ��� a harvest dependent on bee pollination. A farmer looks on as a pesticide is sprayed and appears to disable a bee without killing it. When that bee returns to its colony we are told it will spread the pesticide." it implies a strong connection. In a scene filmed in northern China where pesticides are heavily used bees have all but vanished and peasants are reduced to laboriously importing pollen from the south and daubing it by hand on blossoms. Other contributing factors to bee depopulation are the varroa mite which attaches to the bee and weakens it and the stress of travel." Africanized honey bees that were discovered in the 1970s and began entering the United States two decades ago? Demonized before their arrival as dangerous and unproductive they may not entirely deserve the bad reputation according to the film. They are prodigious honey makers." a German neurobiologist who views a bee colony as a single large animal.

But it is a thought-experiment driven above all by emotion. The actual actors united in make-believe grief are moved to create a second reality full of pain desire and loss. ���Eurydice�۝ is partly about the fleeting nature of love and the vain glorious hope that art might somehow arrest the passage of time and give back what time so heedlessly takes away.

The title evokes a piece of ancient almost mythic film history: that surreal Orphic moment associated in the popular mind with ���The Jazz Singer �۝ when pictures began to talk. It also has a more primal meaning. The world and the people in it might grow old but the imagination has the power to make everything new.

Dogberry perpetually aggrieved and secretly noble is like a Samuel Beckett character and Nathan Fillion (the former misbehaving captain of Serenity) plays him like a weary cop from a police show on the brink of cancellation resigned to the bureaucratic indignities and petty absurdities that surround him." and so I like Mr. Whedon�۪s take on ���Much Ado About Nothing�۝ better than Kenneth Branagh�۪s star-studded fancy-dress 1993 version. In this one the costumes the sets and the voices anchor the play in a pop-cultural dimension where it sparkles effortlessly and a few loose ends and incongruities only increase the fun. The Italian political context in which Shakespeare embedded his couples was never very plausible or coherent and here it is enough to know that they dwell in a world of money power shifting allegiance and factional intrigue." this ���Much Ado�۝ has a sly robust eroticism entirely appropriate to Shakespeare�۪s text which abounds in earthy wordplay. The title itself is a dirty Elizabethan double entendre and the actors relish the naughty nuances of their dialogue. The flirting and swooning have some heat which goes a long way to making the movie as cool as it is."

There�۪s a distinct daddy-knows-best whiff to this tableau that�۪s underscored when a TV announcer bleats about the New Founding Fathers God and America just before the Emergency Broadcast System kicks in.

Short on words if rarely breath Franck runs to save his family his cash and an ever-more outrageous movie that shouldn�۪t work yet does." whose craggy face suggests that his character has racked up major mileage but still has plenty in reserve.

His former partner in the same prison is hassling him while some big-house Neanderthals all muscle and mysterious foreign murmurings have their eyes on Franck�۪s cellmate. A smiler named Jean-Louis (a terrific St̩phane Debac) the cellmate has been convicted of a sex crime he insists he didn�۪t commit. Franck dislikes Jean-Louis but when push comes to shiv Franck comes to his rescue." at least not in genre cinema. Franck saves Jean-Louis (painting that wall red in the process) who turns out to be just as dangerous as Mr. Debac�۪s insinuating soft voice ��� he gives every conversation the unsettling feel of a conspiracy ��� and creepily composed delivery suggest. The trouble really begins after Jean-Louis is released and a manic former gendarme Manuel (Sergi L�_pez) swings by to share some intel with Franck about him: quiet retiring Jean-Louis may be a serial killer who preys on young women. Suddenly Franck grasping that his wife daughter and money are in danger escapes slipping past the prison guards and fortifications so easily that it�۪s a wonder the story didn�۪t start years earlier." from a script by Luc Bossi and Laurent Turner ���The Prey�۝ turns on a familiar crime-story setup in which the antihero endures a crucible of suffering as much for his (infrequently her) flashes of decency as for his wrongs. This decency is nice for viewers ��� genuine evil can become tiresome what with all the bloodletting and one-dimensional villainy ��� and it serves other useful functions like investing the antihero with renegade moral authority. From the way Franck treats his family and initially Jean-Louis it�۪s obvious that even if he�۪s a convicted bank robber (a durably forgivable transgression) he isn�۪t morally corrupt. He�۪s good enough to keep audiences on his side and just dangerous enough to keep the cops the real offender and us jumping." the cop and the possible killer ��� but not for these screenwriters who seem to have binge-watched American television police procedurals in between researching murderers and thumbing through hard-boiled crime fiction. Fairly early Mr. Bossi (who helped write Michel Gondry�۪s next movie ���Mood Indigo�۝) and Mr. Turner also introduce a group of detectives led by a hard-charging beauty Claire (a surprisingly plausible Alice Taglioni).

Whether stuffing its graceless hero into a clown suit on a construction site or sending him on a first date with an offbeat neighbor to give a safe-sex talk at a home for the elderly the film is funny only on paper if that." agoraphobic father (a hearty Barry Bostwick) has turned his old bedroom into a bathroom and taken up with the busty brassy Gloria (Lainie Kazan). Joy (Liane Balaban) is the oddball girl next door who just does everything a little differently and falls for Kyle. Kyle�۪s brother and sister-in-law by the way also live and bicker under Dad�۪s roof. (Everyone�۪s ages seem vaguely off for their casting.)" who plays a Steve Carell-style square loosening up that she will die soon and this development is ultimately even more arbitrary than it sounds. As a director Mr. De Rosa has trouble getting from here to there emotionally speaking. Personal lessons are learned; winsome songs and music paper over the gaps. If this is joy give me doldrums."

wide-eyed stare of a frightened animal; a voice that pitches into hysteria at the first sign of conflict; a mouth that scrunches into a tragic clown mask. Those tics which make Claire Danes�۪s portrayal of Carrie Mathison in ���Homeland�۝ so compelling all work against her in ���As Cool as I Am.�۝ Her acting is simply too extreme to fit inside this family drama set in Belen a small town in central New Mexico." whose pride and joy is her smart feisty daughter Lucy (Sarah Bolger) an attractive brainy high school sophomore who obsessively watches cooking shows and hopes to be a chef. Lucy is the product of what used to be called a shotgun marriage between Lainee and Chuck (James Marsden) a logger who spends months away from home." Kenny (Thomas Mann). Frustrated at being abandoned for long periods Lainee indulges in casual affairs when opportunities arise." Lucy determinedly loses her virginity to Kenny a sweet wisp of a boy when she climbs into his bedroom window and gently forces herself on him." adapted by Virginia Korus Spragg from a 2003 novel by Pete Fromm is up-to-date enough that Lucy and Kenny immediately agree that she should take the morning-after pill. Yet these teenagers and their friends also seem to occupy a world without smartphones and text messages." ���As Cool as I Am�۝ is more or less smooth sailing for the first hour. This actress portrays Lucy with a spiky straightforward honesty. But when Kenny�۪s prim disapproving mother suspects the affair she dispatches her son across the state to live with his father a recovering alcoholic. Later Lucy becomes pregnant after being raped by her date at a party. She presumably has an abortion but that word is not mentioned. The movie eventually turns choppy and new characters appear and disappear without explanation. It is as if chunks of the film had landed on the editing-room floor in a desperate last-minute attempt to trim its length. Just when its parts should come together ���As Cool as I Am�۝ crumbles to bits."

As Xiaochuan pushes his young companion through pain and exhaustion Mr. Li provides the charisma that his wooden colleague lacks. This is at least partly the fault of a screenplay (by Chang Chia-lu and Cheng Hsiao-che) that gives Shuhao very little to say: whether making eyes at a winsome widow or witnessing a tragic accident he makes fewer noises than those dogs." the publicity notes suggest may have deepened the character but this version seems determined to make location the star.

All of them come from relatively privileged backgrounds and have painful intimate reasons for taking up the cause." ���The East�۝ is a bit more persuasive on the psychology of its characters than on the politics of their actions.

But their animus is also explained in ways that strain credibility and undermine the film�۪s topicality. Benji Izzy and Doc are motivated by grief filial resentment and a desire for revenge. For them the political is personal which makes it a little less urgent for everybody else." after all a twisty breathless genre film ��� to wish that it would frame the contradictions of contemporary capitalism more rigorously.

so the two hours of Margarethe von Trotta�۪s ardent and intelligent film about her are bound to feel somewhat superficial. And the movie even as it answers a hunger for engagement with the life of an extraordinary mind may also awaken an appetite for more. Arendt�۪s work a heady amalgam of philosophy history journalism and political theory does not easily align with the academic fashions of the moment." Barbara Sukowa will do for Arendt what Nora Ephron and Meryl Streep did for Julia Child but surely a fellow can dream. And in a manner not altogether dissimilar to the way ���Julie & Julia�۝ mastered the art of French cooking ���Hannah Arendt�۝ conveys the glamour charisma and difficulty of a certain kind of German thought. Ms. Sukowa compact and energetic and not overly concerned with impersonation captures Arendt�۪s fearsome cerebral power as well as her warmth and above all the essential unappeasable curiosity that drove her." and she was an eyewitness to many of the central follies and catastrophes of the age ��� Ms. von Trotta concentrates on two exemplary and controversial episodes. The first is Arendt�۪s coverage of the trial of Adolf Eichmann and the furor that followed the publication of her reporting first as a series of articles in The New Yorker and then as the book ���Eichmann in Jerusalem.�۝ The second presented in slightly awkward flashbacks is Arendt�۪s relationship with the German philosopher Martin Heidegger her teacher and lover who publicly joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and never publicly repented after the war." played by Klaus Pohl and Eichmann represented in real clips from his 1961 trial are contrasting embodiments of the ���dark time �۝ as Arendt calls it that shadows every aspect of her life. Though she and her husband Heinrich Bl�_cher (Axel Milberg) live in relative ease in 1960s Manhattan ��� their work teaching and writing blending seamlessly with a leisure of contentious cocktail parties and discreet adultery on his part ��� the trauma of the Holocaust is never far away. In Eichmann�۪s trial following his seizure by Israeli operatives in Argentina Arendt an assimilated German Jew and a Zionist in her youth sees an opportunity to stare in the face the horrors she had explored in ���The Origins of Totalitarianism.�۝" famously was a mask of bureaucratic blandness summed up by her phrase ���the banality of evil.�۝ Her description of Eichmann as a thoughtless bloodless functionary rather than a monster led to accusations that she was defending him just as her discussion of the role of Jewish leaders in the destruction of their communities provoked charges of victim blaming. The reaction to ���Eichmann in Jerusalem�۝ was harsh and relentless and Ms. von Trotta shows how it extended from the public realm of learned journalism into Arendt�۪s personal life costing her several longstanding friendships." played with winning verve and appropriate venom by Janet McTeer. In addition to writing ���The Hue and Cry �۝ an essay published in Partisan Review skewering Arendt�۪s critics McCarthy rallies Arendt�۪s morale and coaches her in the martial arts of defense and counterattack. Their friendship (immortalized in a splendid volume of letters that has clearly served as one of Ms. von Trotta�۪s sources) is a fascinating study in cultural and temperamental contrast an impulsive and witty American paired with a steady phlegmatic German." �۝ though ultimately a celebration of seriousness is grim or plodding. On the contrary the movie turns ideas into the best kind of entertainment. There is an undeniable nostalgic thrill in stepping into an era in New York when philosophers lived in apartments with Hudson River views and smoking was permitted even in college lecture halls especially if you are someone for whom the summit of early-�۪60s Manhattan magic is not Madison Avenue or Macdougal Street but Riverside Drive. But it would be a mistake to file this film with all the other rose-colored midcentury costume dramas." formally radical New German Film of the 1970s Ms. von Trotta has been interested in history as an active current in the present. This is perhaps most vivid in ���Rosa Luxemburg�۝ (1986) in which Ms. Sukowa played that early-20th-century writer and militant as a thoroughly modern spirit passionate and skeptical." but the work of thinking is notoriously difficult to show. In this case it looks a lot like smoking with intervals of typing pacing or staring at the ceiling from a daybed in the study." I would not hesitate to describe ���Hannah Arendt�۝ as an action movie though of a more than usually dialectical type. Its climax in which Arendt defends herself against critics matches some of the great courtroom scenes in cinema and provides a stirring reminder that the labor of figuring out the world is necessary difficult and sometimes genuinely heroic."

�۝ her remarkable debut feature has an almost classical simplicity. Shira (Hadas Yaron) a young woman living in an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Tel Aviv faces a choice not unlike those faced by the heroines of Jane Austen novels and Hollywood romantic comedies. Which man will she marry? For Shira this is an especially agonizing question because it forces her to weigh the claims of family loyalty religious duty and her own desires." but brokered and facilitated by parents and professional matchmakers ��� Shira is engaged to a soft-spoken ginger-bearded fellow. Her happiness is quickly overshadowed by the death of her beloved older sister Esther (Renana Raz) who leaves behind a newborn son and a husband Yochay (Yiftach Klein). As the family struggles with grief the possibility begins to emerge that Yochay might marry Shira." but it offers some practical and emotional advantages especially to Shira�۪s mother (Irit Sheleg) who can�۪t bear the thought that Yochay might leave Israel with her only grandchild. But though Shira and her brother-in-law get along reasonably well the idea that she could replace Esther shocks her conscience and her sense of propriety." and there is no shortage of advice from friends family members and other interested parties. What the film makes clear with unfailing sensitivity and wry humor is that for Shira and her family the ordinary arrangements of living are freighted with moral and spiritual significance. Their routines are dominated by prayer ritual observance and obedience to Jewish law but their world does not seem narrow and austere. On the contrary it is at times almost unbearably full of feeling and significance." and it is one of a small handful of modern movies that depict religious devotion from within. Characters in black hats and head coverings are not uncommon in Israeli cinema but they tend to be viewed by secular filmmakers with curiosity or condescension or as symbols of a social problem." a description that could also be applied to Ms. Yaron�۪s performance. Shira is modest and sensible forthright with her opinions and discreet about expressing emotion but the way Ms. Yaron composes her features ��� and the way she is lighted by Ms. Burshtein and the cinematographer Asaf Sudry ��� seems to offer direct access to her soul." complicated characters including her parents her sharp-tongued Aunt Hanna (Razia Israeli) and the rabbi whose counsel is sought on matters grand and trivial. (In one scene he interrupts an urgent marriage-related discussion to advise an old woman who wants to buy a new stove.) As Yochay Mr. Klein is a gentle brooding presence and also an intriguing at times almost frightening enigma. How well does Shira know him? How much does she want to?" and it is this ��� the sense we have of witnessing a young person figuring herself out in the most challenging circumstances ��� that makes the film both accessible and thrilling. It is completely unexpected and entirely believable."

in Paris rekindling the romance that first sparked nine years before that in Vienna? Luckily (for us and for them) they are still together having hatched a pair of sweet blond twin girls and glided or maybe stumbled into their 40s. And of course because they are played by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke Celine and Jesse are still better looking than most of the rest of us and still have quite a lot to say about themselves each other and the world." �۝ the third of Richard Linklater�۪s Aristotelian bulletins from the field of Gen-X solipsism finds them in Greece at the end of a summer vacation that has been pleasant though not entirely carefree. These two have never been terribly easygoing despite their efforts to keep things casual and cool. For their Peloponnesian sojourn they were joined by Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) Jesse�۪s son from the stateside marriage that conclusively ended when he missed the plane home from Paris in ���Before Sunset.�۝ The boy�۪s departure precipitates some soul-searching on his father�۪s part." and wants to explore the possibility of moving to Chicago from their home in Paris to be closer to Hank and challenge the custody arrangements that have kept him with his unnamed conveniently demonized mother. Celine perhaps jumping to conclusions and perhaps wise to Jesse�۪s passive-aggressive ways interprets his invitation to think about the move as a demand to make it happen." but not only or primarily about this in the course of a day that includes a leisurely drive from the airport a long meal with friends and a reluctant visit to a hotel in a charming seaside town. At one point an implicit allusion is made to ���Voyage to Italy �۝ Roberto Rossellini�۪s great 1954 film about the foundering of a marriage in a picturesque Mediterranean location. In that movie the bright sun exposes fissures in the relationship between the characters played by George Sanders and Ingrid Bergman who also seemed haunted by the ghosts of vanished civilizations." though they are creatures of a different time are susceptible to a similar malaise. Their complaints about each other may be banal and specific ��� he�۪s a slob; she�۪s a nit-picker ��� but as always their quarrels and digressions gesture toward something larger." though that is one of their habits. Jesse a writer spends some time spit-balling themes for his new novel in the company of an older colleague and a Greek neighbor and a bunch of perennial philosophical puzzles ��� the meaning of love the nature of time the difference between men and women ��� are batted around over wine and stuffed peppers (in company that includes Athina Rachel Tsangari the director of ���Attenberg �۝ and Ariane Labed that film�۪s star.)" sometimes exasperating and impressively true to the rhythms and idioms of actual speech. It constitutes nearly all of the action in the movie though there is also some walking driving and an inconclusive attempt at sex. But the words are only incidentally or superficially what the movie is about. They represent Jesse and Celine�۪s attempt ��� and Mr. Linklater�۪s ��� to control the flow of experience to find meaning and to keep a terrible and nameless anxiety at bay." �۝ ���Before Sunset�۝ and ���Before Midnight�۝ are modest charming movies that together add up to the great romantic epic of a generation defined in the popular mind and our therapists�۪ offices by hedged bets easy ironies and perpetual confusion. Mr. Linklater�۪s shooting style is so graceful and unobtrusive and Mr. Hawke and Ms. Delpy inhabit their characters with such conviction that the challenge and originality of the movies are easy to overlook. It is also easy to be distracted by your feelings about Jesse and Celine who can get on your nerves almost as much as they get on each other�۪s." and also the integrity of this cycle of films. It is hard to think of a pair of lovers in recent screen history who expend less effort trying to charm the audience. All of their attention is focused on each other with the rest of us as intimate witnesses laughing and cringing and sometimes crying as they tack from coy evasion to vicious honesty and back. Celine�۪s anger ��� a general feminist impatience with men and a particular resentment of Jesse�۪s self-absorption ��� is both thrilling and shocking. Jesse�۪s dreamy intellectualism can be appealing but you can also see how his complacency provokes Celine�۪s rage." that is because the stakes have shifted. ���Before Sunrise�۝ was a bittersweet romance about young people ��� Could we ever really have been that young? Are we really that old now? ��� with all the time in the world to savor regrets and learn from mistakes. ���Before Sunset�۝ was a comedy of second chances zigzagging toward a long-deferred happy ending." �۝ however is something rarer and riskier. In her new book ���I Do and I Don�۪t �۝ the film scholar Jeanine Basinger tracks the history of ���the marriage movie �۝ an elusive perhaps mythical genre that tries to dramatize one of the most common and mysterious of human relations. In modern cinema she writes ���stories of marriage grew less and less dramatic slowing down to an almost cin̩ma-v̩rit̩ movement toward realism with no resolution or explanation to be found and certainly no explanation of what kept any couple together.�۝" ���Before Midnight�۝ fits this description almost exactly which is to say that it is exquisitely attuned to the fragile flawed nature of their bond. We have known them and they have known each other for a long time now but we don�۪t know from one moment to the next what their future will be or what it is that keeps them going." a scary fact of life is something most movies avoid. We prefer the magical thinking of neat endings tidy plots and clear character arcs. ���Before Midnight�۝ is a wonderful paradox: a movie passionately committed to the ideal of imperfection that is itself very close to perfect."

It�۪s a tale of absolutist ideals that seemed somehow to curdle and of private torment in search of an outlet with drastic results." over two hours long shuffles awkwardly among the well-publicized tale of WikiLeaks led by the hubristic Mr. Assange; Private Manning�۪s far more compelling woes involving sexual identity; and some sharp but overlapping commentators. The sprawling treatment lacks the swing and drive the filmmaker has shown elsewhere and the narrative feels stretched to include an evidently prized interview with one of two women who have made allegations of sex crimes against Mr. Assange. (He appears here only in secondhand tag-along footage.)" whose face is partly concealed plays a role in the film�۪s central simplistic pivot concerning Mr. Assange whose WikiLeaks Web site also supplied sensitive government documents to news organizations including The New York Times and The Guardian of London." the WikiLeaks frontman goes from bold unnerving liberator of secrets ��� like the skin-crawling classified footage of an American helicopter attack on a crowd in Baghdad that killed 12 people including two Reuters journalists ��� to a paranoid creep criticized by those who once worked with him and on the run from accusations of rape." unctuous Mr. Assange (and on Bill Hader�۪s impersonations on ���Saturday Night Live�۝) may be primed for such a sketch but that arc pales beside for example the intimate online chat records that let us get inside the head of Private Manning. (Mr. Assange remains in asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. After the movie�۪s completion Private Manning after prolonged solitary confinement pleaded guilty to 10 charges but is awaiting trial in a military court on more serious counts.)" Adrian Lamo who has said he turned in the soldier for the common good.

You�۪re more likely to squirm though at what seems as incongruous as a Chekhov play staged in clown costume. At least it is not dull." who stars as Linda Sinclair an unmarried 40-something high school teacher in Pennsylvania gives a sensitive subtle portrayal of a woman who loses her emotional balance and suffers all manner of humiliation. The tipping point arrives when Jason Sherwood (Michael Angarano) a scruffy former student of hers who moved to New York City to pursue a playwriting career returns to his hometown after failing to get his work produced." Fiona Shaw declares in an introductory voice-over Linda accepted that her ���uncompromising spirit doomed her to a spinster�۪s life.�۝ Attractive in an unflashy way she lives a comfortable but solitary existence dedicated to teaching and literature."

Or some other hard fact that she might have acknowledged before but mostly for other people or for later." �۝ someone says and while that may in some sense be true it is also true that 27 is not as old as it used to be. A few short generations ago members of the American middle class could be expected to reach that age in possession of a career a spouse and at least one child unless they were rock stars in which case they would be dead." post-collegiate New Yorkers precocity has become its own form of arrested development. They are clever and curious but also complacent content to drift through jobs and relationships as they camouflage their anxiety with easy sarcasm and overdone enthusiasm. Mr. Baumbach has explored this territory before most notably in ���Kicking and Screaming �۝ his first feature released when he was in his mid-20s almost 20 years ago. And what has been called the quarter-life crisis is a common enough theme these days." �۝ Mr. Baumbach�۪s least overtly autobiographical film as a director is not primarily an act of generational portraiture on his part or Ms. Gerwig�۪s. It is entirely caught up in the individuality of its heroine who is viewed with affectionate detachment and in the details of her environment which are given a romantic lift by Sam Levy�۪s supple shadowy monochrome cinematography and a musical soundtrack borrowed mostly from the great French film composer Georges Delerue." jaunty rhythms and sharp off-kilter jokes ���Frances Ha�۝ is frequently delightful. Ms. Gerwig and Mr. Baumbach are nonetheless defiant partisans in the revolt against the tyranny of likability in popular culture. Frances is neither blandly agreeable nor adorably quirky. Rather like Roger Greenberg (in Mr. Baumbach�۪s ���Greenberg�۝) ��� but not at all like him because she is a completely different person ��� she is difficult. She hogs conversations misses obvious social cues and is frequently inconsiderate though more in the manner of an overgrown toddler than a queen-bee mean girl." Benji (Michael Zegen) calls her ���undateable �۝ and for most of the movie she is romantically unattached having broken up with an irrelevant boyfriend in an early scene. Really she has made an easy choice between him and her best friend Sophie (the marvelously spiky Mickey Sumner) setting herself up for heartache when Sophie in effect chooses a man over her. Frances and Sophie who live together at the start of the movie are more than best friends." �۝ Frances likes to say and she also likes to imagine that theirs will be a lifelong love story technically chaste but always passionate and fulfilling." Patch (Patrick Heusinger) who becomes her fianc̩ and takes her to Tokyo. Frances is left to improvise and also to learn some hard lessons none of which are terribly surprising in hindsight but most of which she still somehow fails to anticipate. She bounces from one living situation to another briefly to Paris and to Sacramento for Christmas with her parents (played by Ms. Gerwig�۪s own parents). Her professional progress is as precarious as her social life." the idea no doubt carefully nurtured by sympathetic parents and progressive schools that her specialness makes her immune to failure. It is painful to watch the world challenging this view even as it is also hard not to be on the side of the world. But the spirit of the film is more wry than punitive and it is in the end less a satire or a cautionary tale than a bedtime story for young adults. It will all work out. Twenty-seven is young. Frances will have the last laugh." they smoke they talk about sex."

Like other important figures in the history of medicine he is a complicated figure in retrospect at once a charlatan and a pioneer a monster and a modernizer." �۝ Alice Winocour�۪s vivid and feverish debut feature allows all of these possibilities to hover before arriving at the conclusion that Charcot was only human. Played by Vincent Lindon with somber reserve he is shown working late into the night chain-smoking as he studies cross-sections of brain tissue in search of clues." he worries about how his research will be received by the scientific establishment and the social elite. At his clinic in the Piti̩-Salp̻tri̬re Hospital in Paris he is an imperious embodiment of male authority viewed by the female patients with a mixture of terror and reverence. A newly arrived young woman is told to pray not to God but to Charcot." a young illiterate housemaid who has been dispatched to Salp̻tri̬re after a seizure has paralyzed one side of her face and ruined a fancy dinner party. In the early scenes her quiet terror and the brown brooding light give ���Augustine�۝ a scary gothic feeling. Ms. Winocour deftly evokes primal terrors of captivity and cruelty and also the erotic fascination that lingers around such fears. You wonder if the film will resemble a lost Bront�� novel or ���The Story of O.�۝" as it turns out though it is essentially a dark romance of sex and power. Augustine becomes a special case for Charcot which means that she participates in his public demonstrations of therapeutic technique. These are vital for Charcot�۪s legitimacy and his financing but they are also theatrical spectacles involving the hypnosis of a naked woman for an audience of men. There is lusty applause afterward and reviews run in the newspaper." but the knowledge is just out of his reach. He is also less and less able to suppress an attraction to Augustine." the film is what might be called a melodrama of transference one of a number of recent movies exploring the treacherous dynamic between a fallible therapist and a disturbed patient. ���A Dangerous Method �۝ David Cronenberg�۪s film about Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein (with Freud hovering in the background) is one notable recent example. Others might include ���The Master�۝ and ���The Skin I Live In �۝Pedro Almod�_var�۪s supremely creepy medical film noir." ���Augustine�۝ is a love story but not in the conventional sense and not only because the romance violates an obvious ethical taboo. The affair that erupts between Charcot and his patient goes against the protocols of treatment but it ��� or at least the underlying current of emotion ��� is also part of how the treatment works. In the end of all these films it is the healers who suffer becoming more helpless and tormented as their vulnerable patients surrender seduce and fight back." through the uncanny power of Soko�۪s face and body. A well-known French pop singer she is as grave and luminous as a silent-film star.

I suspect our first sense of the past begins with the simple childhood request for a story about our families and ourselves. In her quietly moving intelligent documentary ���Stories We Tell �۝ the Canadian actress and director Sarah Polley sat down with relatives and friends and asked them to talk about her mother Diane Polley who died in 1990 when Ms. Polley was 11. The idea or so it first seems is that every fondly unearthed detail anecdote and memory will fill in the biography of a woman whose seemingly ordinary life ��� of tending children husband and home ��� contained multitudes and mysteries and with tugging and shaping can be tidied into a story." including her father Michael; her brothers John and Mark; and her sisters Susy and Joanna (a ringer for the director). Speaking off camera and sometimes on Ms. Polley asks these five ��� along with other relatives and a handful of her mother�۪s friends and colleagues ����� to talk about Diane from the beginning. And so from the homey intimacy of their living-room couches chairs and tables the Storytellers start digging into a shared past that grows more complex surprising and touching with each recollection and that Ms. Polley supplements with home movies old photographs and other visual materials." there are many stories to tell partly because there was nothing neat about Diane Polley the life she lived and the secrets she kept. Then again Ms. Polley her youngest wasn�۪t interested in making a traditional portrait of Mum as her children call her maybe because Mum wasn�۪t especially traditional. Whatever the reason you learn a lot about what other people think about Diane ��� who�۪s characterized as both independent and family-oriented as an extrovert and an enigma ��� but relatively few facts. There�۪s nothing about when or where she was born whether she attended college or when she married. She acted on and off but whether she showed real talent remains undiscussed. That she was a good-enough actress when and where it mattered becomes evident." there�۪s a reason. ���Stories We Tell�۝ is an affecting documentary tale about a mother and wife who ached in many of the familiar ways but didn�۪t always follow the typical female playbook which also gives her life the resonance of a mystery that�۪s too good to spoil here. Diane Polley took liberties endured tragedies and set off on adventures the full extent of which the Storytellers reveal with laughter and a deep well of melancholia. She comes across as simultaneously suburban and bohemian locked into the usual roles and yet also stubbornly liberated from them. How she managed this ��� while raising her children and pleasing a husband who didn�۪t always love her the way she needed ��� is central to the stories and secrets that Ms. Polley gently shares." including its humor and formal design although its most admirable quality is the deep sense of personal ethics that frames Ms. Polley�۪s filmmaking choices. Although it touches on intimate points many recounted by Michael Polley in voice-over the movie is revelatory rather than exploitative. And while the movie finally proves as much an autobiographical tale as a biographical one Ms. Polley resists turning it into a flattering self-portrait of a young artist in search of her origins. Instead building on the interest in narrative form that she expressed in earlier movies like ���Take This Waltz �۝ she explores storytelling itself and the space between a life lived and its different at times conflicting representations." but most adhere to the communally accepted facts of her life. What matters to Ms. Polley is how each person organizes those memories with love humor regret self-interest or in the case of Michael Polley a sometimes wincing mix of emotional detachment and lacerating humor. To watch Ms. Polley ��� her face drained of readable emotion and her body vibrating as if from unarticulated anxiety ��� as she watches Michael talk about Diane and their life together is unexpectedly moving. Not all of these stories are easy. Yet unlike those filmmakers who explore their family histories to settle scores or indulge in self-mythology Sarah Polley knows that it is never all about her."

Flashing back to earlier moments of glory the film follows Venus and Serena through injuries and other health problems. Venus the older sister and the first to rise to prominence seems to be fading quietly from the scene while Serena always more dramatic and more controversial struggles with frustration and disappointment." and Serena would dispatch Agnieszka Radwanska in a Wimbledon final that will long be remembered as a singularly ferocious feat of athletic domination. Those victories (and a Wimbledon doubles title) provide an odd off-key coda to a movie that is already more than a little muddled." as is often the case in behind-the-scenes documentaries authorized by celebrities. The audience will gain a vague gratifying frisson of intimacy but no real insights or revelations." coached and nurtured by their father Richard and their less talkative but no less determined mother Oracene ��� is a remarkable chapter in the history of race and sports in America. The version told here is detailed but also superficial since Ms. Baird�۪s and Ms. Major�۪s intentions and methods are more promotional than journalistic." John McEnroe Bill Clinton and Chris Rock offer their mostly laudatory thoughts about Venus and Serena who share their mostly approving thoughts about themselves. And who can argue? They have broadened the appeal of a game that took much too long to shed its exclusive lily-white associations and helped to make it part of contemporary popular culture." with some good stuff to show but nothing very new to say."

it is an eminently enjoyable movie ��� is to put aside whatever literary agenda you are tempted to bring with you. I grant that this is not so easily done. F. Scott Fitzgerald�۪s slender charming third novel has accumulated a heavier burden of cultural significance than it can easily bear. Short and accessible enough to be consumed in a sitting (as in ���Gatz �۝ Elevator Repair Service�۪s full-text staged reading) the book has become in the 88 years since its publication a schoolroom staple and a pop-cultural totem. It shapes our increasingly fuzzy image of the jazz age and fuels endless term papers on the American dream and related topics." the wistful glimmer of Fitzgerald�۪s prose shines like the green light at the end of Daisy Buchanan�۪s dock. If ���The Great Gatsby�۝ can�۪t quite sustain the Big Ideas that are routinely attached to it ��� a fact that periodically inspires showboating critical contrarians to proclaim that it�۪s not such a big deal after all ��� it nonetheless remains a lively imaginative presence. The book may not be as Great as its reputation but it is also partly for that reason better than you might expect. It is flawed and flimsy in some ways but it still manages to be touching surprising and in its bittersweet fashion a lot of fun." brightly colored rendering of the sad story of Jay Gatsby the Trimalchio of West Egg Long Island it should at least be immune to accusations of sacrilege. ���Gatsby�۝ is not gospel; it is grist for endless reinterpretation. Mr. Luhrmann�۪s reverence for the source material is evident. He sticks close to the details of the story and lifts dialogue and description directly from the novel�۪s pages. But he has also felt free to make that material his own bending it according to his artistic sensibility and what he takes to be the mood of the times. The result is less a conventional movie adaptation than a splashy trashy opera a wayward lavishly theatrical celebration of the emotional and material extravagance that Fitzgerald surveyed with fascinated ambivalence." and his vision of 1920s Manhattan is exactly as naturalistic as his portrait of Belle ��poque Paris in ���Moulin Rouge�۝ which is to say not very much. Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) is still a bully and a bigot spouting the popular racist pseudoscience of his day. The gangster Meyer Wolfsheim (Amitabh Bachchan) is a bit less of a cringe-worthy anti-Semitic caricature than he was in 1925. The poverty of George and Myrtle Wilson (Jason Clarke and Isla Fisher) remains a grim contrast to the endless ease of Gatsby and the Buchanans. But all of these people occupy a cartoon America that no living person has ever visited." new money and old ��� are noted but they don�۪t have a whole lot of resonance. We are in a world of artifice and illusion confected from old-fashioned production-design virtuosity and newfangled digital hocus-pocus." the viewer swoops and swerves through one of Gatsby�۪s parties in a movement that combines Vincente Minnelli-style suavity with the controlled vertigo of a theme park ride. As it happens Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) compares the sybaritic scene at Gatsby�۪s mansion to ���an amusement park.�۝ And Mr. Luhrmann�۪s peculiar genius ��� also the thing that drives cultural purists of various stripes crazy ��� lies in his eager calculating mix of refinement and vulgarity." his diffident mouthpiece was immune to the seductions of hedonism and luxury and the book does not entirely succeed as a critique of American materialism at what seemed to be its high-water mark. Mr. Luhrmann for his part does not resist at all. He fuses the iconography of dressed-up �۪20s decadence with the swagger of hip-hop high-end consumerism. Jay Gatsby has got money. He�۪s got cars. He�۪ll spend a hundred grand over by the bar." say Jay-Z (an executive producer of the film) Jay Gatsby is a rich man whose modest background and criminal past are something to be hidden sources of mystery shame and potential ruin. To Tom Buchanan Gatsby is ���Mr. Nobody from Nowhere �۝ while to Nick he is a shimmering enigma first glimpsed through the window of his colossal home." he is a movie star. In previous incarnations he was Robert Redford Alan Ladd and Warner Baxter and now Leonardo DiCaprio has slipped into the ice cream suit and the curious diction. ���Old sport�۝ may be the two hardest words for an American actor to say but for Gatsby himself they were an affectation so it is possible to overlook Mr. DiCaprio�۪s overdone accent. (I do wish he would try a performance without one though.) More important it is impossible to look away from him. His charisma has increased as his youthful prettiness has worn and thickened away and he is beautiful sad confident and desperate in exactly the way Gatsby should be." and conjures up his own idealized vision of Daisy (Carey Mulligan) the girl he left behind and acquired his ill-gotten fortune to win back." but Mr. Luhrmann Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Mulligan make it an effective one. At a crucial climactic moment ��� a scene in a suite at the Plaza Hotel ��� the director mutes his irrepressible circus ringmaster showmanship and plunges into undiluted melodrama. The music stops and the camera cuts among the assembled faces as the emotional core of the film is laid bare." of course. He is self-invented and also self-deluded spinning out fantasies for himself and others as easily as he gives parties. As a character in Nick�۪s ruminations in Fitzgerald�۪s sentences and in our national mythology he is a complete mess. This movie is worthy of him." adultery illegal hooch and other jazz age vices."

brutish and mercifully short the woozy comedy ���Sightseers�۝ tells the tale of two ordinary British eccentrics who initially bring to mind the gargoyles both amusing and alarming that populate Mike Leigh movies. A droopy passive-aggressive frowner Tina (Alice Lowe) lives with her hectoring mother Carol (Eileen Davies) in a house crammed with kitsch and collectibles many dog-themed and portraying a beloved recently deceased terrier. It�۪s the kind of domestic horror show that certain British filmmakers either mock or sentimentalize and which the British director Ben Wheatley (���Down Terrace�۝) takes to with a very heavy very unforgiving ax." squeezed into a car with her bearded new boyfriend Chris (Steve Oram). With his prized caravan in tow ��� it�۪s at once a home and a bright emblem of their grievously limited horizons ��� they�۪re headed for an old-fashioned vacation tooling around northern Britain." where while riding a vintage tram Chris notices and publicly reprimands another visitor for dropping a food wrapper on the floor. The litterbug a burly family man ignores the rebuke and right after he drops another piece of trash Chris turns the offender into roadkill. After a brief uneventful pop into the local constabulary Chris is good-humoredly spray-cleaning the blood off a caravan tire." Mr. Wheatley continues in the same bludgeoning amusingly if dubiously deadpan fashion for what soon feels like an overextended joke. Tina and Chris visit one attraction after another including the Cumberland Pencil Museum (���Home of the world�۪s first pencil!�۝ its Web site exults) and in between racking up the kilometers and sex ��� their bloodletting comes close to being an aphrodisiac ��� run through and over victims. They�۪re a touchy pair and all it takes for push to come to murderous shove is a careless gesture rude remark or pointedly demonstration of class privilege." ordering her with lordly hauteur to pick up some waste it isn�۪t long before Chris is bashing in the man�۪s head. That particular victim isn�۪t a person Chris assures Tina after the howls and blood; he�۪s ���a Daily Mail reader.�۝ It�۪s an easy feeble laugh (The Daily Mail is a right-leaning tabloid) that�۪s unlikely to travel well beyond British borders." the way the man�۪s snobbery appears to ignite Chris�۪s brutality (after one killing he howls and triumphantly gesticulates with Kubrickian apishness) suggests for one brief flickering moment that the class resentment that rattles throughout ���Sightseers�۝ will put a meaningful maybe even politically trenchant spin on the carnage. Here though evil isn�۪t simply banal it�۪s also associated with class-coded bad taste of a primitivism and vulgarity that are interchangeable with murder and are only funny if you think about it as little as the characters do."

Without offering much of a reason the restless unhappy James hits the Sheltowee Trace National Recreation Trail in eastern Kentucky." this slight uncertain film spends most of its time off trail. One night James and his fiddle fall in with other musicians at a barn dance and draw the attention of a young local woman though he seems too sluggish to respond.

But James is aimless charmless unreachable; it�۪s hard to tell whether he is meant to be a cipher or if Mr. Morton is simply not up to lending him depth.

But its protagonist is an outsider Wade (an amiable Craig Robinson) who tries to get into the family�۪s good graces. Wade intends to propose to his girlfriend Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington appealing in an underwritten role) but first he wants to meet her family. So he drops in on the Peeples estate in Sag Harbor N.Y. for a few days of uncovering secrets: Grace�۪s mom Daphne (a free-spirited S.

Tagging along is Wade�۪s randy brother Chris (a winning Malcolm Barrett)." but the subplots cohere and the assured pacing offers a stark contrast with the often disjointed tempos of Mr. Perry�۪s mosaics. And Ms. Chism who also wrote the screenplay avoids Mr. Perry�۪s judgmental often severe brand of tough love embracing instead a more benign stance of forgiveness and acceptance.

In their brilliant haunting adaptation of ���What Maisie Knew �۝ set in 21st-century Manhattan the directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel and the screenwriters Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright take liberties with the Master�۪s plot while remaining true to the ���design�۝ that he somewhat boastfully explained in his preface to the New York Edition of the book." sexual jealousy meanness and weakness entirely through the point of view of a child who could not possibly understand everything she witnessed. ���What Maisie Knew�۝ is really though not grammatically a question about the character�۪s understanding of what the grown-ups around her are doing. The reader knows more than she does but doesn�۪t always know what she knows and the shadow that falls between our knowledge and hers is where the pathos of the matter lies. James: ���I lose myself truly in appreciation of my theme on noting what she does by her ���freshness�۪ for appearances in themselves vulgar and empty enough.

To play Maisie (an entirely credible name for the 6-year-old daughter of a pair of pretentious New Yorkers) the filmmakers have enlisted Onata Aprile a wide-eyed dark-haired pixie whose quiet watchfulness is perfect for the role. Wisely Mr. Siegel and Mr. McGehee do not try to coax too much acting out of her. There are no displays of precocious insight or histrionic innocence. Maisie says in every case more or less what a child would and tries to please the wayward grown-ups around her even as she deflects their efforts to make her feelings answer their needs." an art dealer and Susanna (Julianne Moore) a musician. Their fights quickly and inevitably lead to a breakup after which Maisie becomes a pawn in a bitter game. Each wants her in order to spite the other and also as evidence of virtue. Their declarations of love are in the moment perfectly sincere but also woefully inadequate." a variation on the jokey jerky guy Mr. Coogan can play in his sleep fills his daughter�۪s life with presents and promises and then vanishes on business trips for months on end. Susanna showers Maisie with manipulative affection and then wanders off into bouts of self-pity or creative abandon." watching these monsters has a twofold effect. On the one hand you may be forgiven a frisson of self-righteous superiority since whatever your own shortcomings you are surely above such blatant acts of deceit and neglect. On the other hand since Beale and Susanna exist on a recognizable continuum of parental behavior you can�۪t help feeling implicated." and that our casual unthinking cruelty to them can be answered by guilty and belated displays of affection. It accomplishes this not by means of melodrama but by a mixture of understatement and thriller-worthy suspense. Every Hollywood hack knows that nothing grabs an audience�۪s emotions like a child in peril and the directors make expert use of this wisdom deploying Nick Urata�۪s score and sly tricks of framing and focus to create a mood of disorientation and dread. What Maisie learns is that nobody will protect her." just over her head might best be described as a sex farce. After the split with Susanna Beale takes up with Margo (Joanna Vanderham) who had been Maisie�۪s live-in nanny and who remains the only trustworthy adult in her life. Susanna more out of calculation than affection takes up with Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgard) a studly young fellow without much ambition. These stepparents in effect share custody of the girl and they begin to look like an impromptu unofficial family." perfect note of ambiguity: ���She still had room for wonder at what Maisie knew.�۝ (���She�۝ is Mrs. Wix a character who has been folded into Margo in the film).

Since Maoism is very much in vogue in some quarters of the left Gilles is scolded by an older comrade and warned away from ���C.I.A. propaganda.�۝ The argument about Mr. Leys�۪s book is echoed in later debates about whether radical art can be made in a traditional style and how violence can be justified." in retrospect to mock Gilles and his friends and to recoil in disgust at their acts of vandalism and brutality. (One of their ���actions�۝ covers their school on the outskirts of Paris in graffiti; another seriously injures a security guard.) For those who came of age later (or for that matter earlier) such judgment may be irresistible. But Mr. Assayas without fully embracing the romantic and dangerous na��vet̩ of his characters nonetheless spares them the condescension of hindsight. The French poet Arthur Rimbaud said that no one is serious at 17 but Mr. Assayas disagrees. No one could take themselves more seriously than these adolescents." �۝ still one of the truest saddest films about the aftermath of a revolution that did not quite happen." who has some obvious kinship with his author ��� both have fathers in the film industry and a vocational interest in painting that leads them toward cinema ��� seems at once immersed in political and artistic struggles and aloof from them as if he were looking for a way to understand his own life as it happens.

Laure (Carole Combes) who speaks in a monotone and gravitates toward drugs and dissipation and Christine (Lola Cr̩ton) who takes up with a Marxist filmmaking collective. His attachments to them are not exactly casual but also not fully committed. Sex for him and for them is connected with politics and art but not in obvious or political ways. Another friend Alain (F̩lix Armand) has a relationship with an American dancer (India Salvor Menuez) that is at once wilder and more conventional." and in any case you should find out for yourself. It is possible to imagine a sequel in which Christine the minister of culture runs into Gilles a filmmaker on the set of a television show produced by Alain.

But Mr. Black and his colleagues like other filmmakers who use the iconography of Sept. 11 and its aftershocks want to have it both ways." while dodging the complex issues and especially the political arguments that might turn off ticket buyers.

Those are loud and generally less impressive than Mr. Pearce and especially Mr. Kingsley who turn in the sort of engaged performances that Mr. Downey no longer gives in the franchise. The ���Iron Man�۝ films turned Mr. Downey into a huge star but the role has gradually maybe inexorably swallowed him. He no longer necessarily does ��� and probably isn�۪t asked to do ��� the hard work of a real performance." he remains an almost ineffably appealing presence.

Mr. Black made his name scribbling breezy action movies like ���Lethal Weapon�۝ and ���The Last Boy Scout �۝ which wed violence to jokes and irony. His only other directing credit is for ���Kiss Kiss Bang Bang�۝ (the title of a Pauline Kael collection) a cutesy self-conscious 2005 action flick with Mr. Downey. Jon Favreau who plays Happy Hogan Stark�۪s security man directed the first two ���Iron Man�۝ films and was thought to be in line for this one before he split for another project." �۝ it�۪s hard to know how much Mr. Black brought to it; his touch is largely evident in the banter and perhaps the swinging retro music over the end credits.

One problem as thoughtful filmmakers like Mr. Soderbergh and others have expressed with alarm and frustration is that the big studios have hitched so much of their resources to so-called tent poles meant to keep studios up and going in lean times." it has become difficult for filmmakers to make midlevel studio movies for adults who value thought over action narrative ambiguity over blunt spectacle. Good big movies are still released and sometimes even produced by the studios. Among the most satisfying films of the past decade are some from ���The Dark Knight�۝ and ���Harry Potter�۝ franchises both of which in their different ways engage Sept. 11 and the world it made while transporting viewers into fantastical realms." �۝ by contrast at once invokes Sept. 11 and dodges it and does so with a wink and a smile.

Mostly it plays out as a virtual reunion tour and fantasy father-and-son encounter session." Jeff was also accomplished if less prolific: when he drowned at 30 in 1997 he had produced just one album ���Grace�۝ (1994) though posthumous releases followed. He had a four-octave vocal range and his father�۪s was five and a half and each could slide dramatically up and down the scale a quality that at times translated into a lonely yearning that fit their sensitive-boy looks. Life and DNA joined them but before Jeff Buckley was born his father split and the two rarely met." �۝ tugging at it like a strong current. Directed by Daniel Algrant the film opens in 1991 with Jeff (the prettily moping Penn Badgley who does his own singing) receiving a call about a tribute concert for his father in Brooklyn Heights. Reluctantly he goes to the concert meanders around stares meaningfully into space (and at the floor) and meets a cool chick Allie (the winning Imogen Poots). Finally he takes the stage and sings several of his father�۪s best-known songs including ���Once I Was.�۝ Featured in the 1978 movie ���Coming Home �۝ it ends with a weepy self-pitying flourish that Jeff movingly claims for himself: ���And sometimes I wonder for a while/Do you ever remember me?�۝" which is nice as is watching Mr. Badgley whose cheekbones and Byronic mop fit his character�۪s brooding self-absorption. Mr. Algrant ends his movie soon after the tribute which he reasonably presents as a turning point for Jeff. Less convincing are his efforts to bring father and son together by continually cutting between Jeff and Tim (Ben Rosenfield) who is seen in flashback on the road and ignoring his life back home. Framed by a cloud of soft curls Tim looks adorable and sounds like a jerk whining that his wife doesn�۪t like his music.

Martha (Clare Bowen displaying the backbone too often denied to her character on ABC�۪s country music soap ���Nashville�۝) and her husband (David Call) wring a living from her family�۪s parched homestead watched over by the accumulating graves of her unlucky kin." an Army deserter who was believed to be dead shows up trailing twisted loyalties and inconvenient principles." ���Dead Man�۪s Burden�۝ draws nourishment from its burned-out desert setting and ambling pace. Shooting on richly textured 35-millimeter film the cinematographer Robert Hauer translates Mr. Mosh̩�۪s evident love for the genre into images that honor their inspirations without mimicking them. And if things get a little baggy in the middle just wait; when a woman in a western is as wedded to her firearm as Martha there can be only two possible outcomes to her story."

As it happens the treachery of time ��� the unwelcome intrusion of the past the empty languor of the present the terrifying uncertainty of the future ��� is one of Rossellini�۪s themes and part of what makes this film for all its charming glimpses of a bygone era feel so unnervingly contemporary." Ingrid Bergman and also with the ideological volatility of Italian cultural life. In 1948 after seeing ���Paisan�۝ and ���Rome: Open City �۝  Bergman wrote Rossellini a letter offering her services if he should ���need a Swedish actress who speaks English very well.�۝ While making ���Stromboli �۝ they began an affair that ended both of their marriages and provoked the highly selective moral outrage of the American press. In his own country Rossellini was attacked less for marital infidelity than for betraying the cause of neorealism allowing his camera to stray from local social problems to Hollywood stars." �۝ as is a strong intimation of the direction of Italian cinema in the coming years. The film follows Katherine and Alex Joyce (Bergman and George Sanders) a British couple who arrive in Naples to sell a piece of property belonging to a recently deceased and highly enigmatic relative known as Uncle Homer.

The rich symbolism of the Italian landscape ��� the volcanic pools at Vesuvius the ruins of Pompeii the vistas that have stirred the imagination of artists at least since Virgil ��� makes the emptiness of the Joyces�۪ marriage all the more palpable and painful. Their emotional and spiritual sterility contrasts with the fertility signified by the baby carriages and pregnant women Katherine encounters every time she ventures into Naples and also by the religious procession of the film�۪s devastating final scene." of locating drama in the unspoken inner lives of his characters anticipates some of what Michelangelo Antonioni would do a few years later in ���L�۪Avventura.�۝ ���Voyage to Italy�۝ is thus in the vanguard of what Pauline Kael would disparagingly call ���come-dressed-as-the-sick-soul-of-Europe parties.�۝ Some of us will never tire of those soirees with their black-tied gloom and elegant suffering and will therefore relish the beauty and melancholy of this voyage along with its touristic snapshots and heart-tugging Neapolitan songs." though their manners and modes of dress mark them as creatures of another perhaps more refined age are immediately recognizable in their loneliness their cynicism and their thwarted desire to connect and to feel. It may be too late. ���Voyage to Italy�۝ takes place in a series of simultaneous aftermaths ��� of World War II of a glorious ancient civilization of Uncle Homer�۪s wild life of whatever passion once united Katherine and Alex.

The edges of the images are softly blurred the light is magical ��� although it isn�۪t remotely clear what that girl and those animals have to do with the following scene of a red radiant devil with horns hooves swishing tail and a literal toolbox entering a house at night like a handyman from Hades on an emergency call. It�۪s no wonder that a young boy in the house who sees this bizarre apparition stops cold to gawk." whose earlier work includes ���Jap�_n�۝ and ���Silent Light �۝ has his way. The trick is whether viewers will also stay put. Here�۪s hoping that they do because while Mr. Reygadas doesn�۪t always make it easy to watch his work (occasionally the reverse) the Carlos Reygadas Experience is always a worthwhile trip. And head-tripping is very much part of Mr. Reygadas�۪s cinema whether or not he�۪s tethered his sometimes lovely sometimes appalling visions to a strong narrative. Certainly there is a story of a sort in ���Post Tenebras Lux�۝ ��� in crude genre terms it�۪s a male psychodrama cum family-man meltdown ��� but it�۪s a narrative that emerges from scenes that at times appear so disconnected they might be from different movies." light �۝ which after the Reformation became a motto of Geneva. ���Post Tenebras Lux�۝ isn�۪t an overtly religious film but it is ��� as its opposing scenes of the luminous child and that red-hot devil suggest ��� a deeply personal intermittently hermetic exploration of innocence and sin good and evil. The vessel for much of this metaphysical investigation is an architect Juan (Adolfo Jim̩nez Castro) who with his wife Natalia (Nathalia Acevedo); their somewhat older son Eleazar; and the toddler Rut lives in rural splendor in an isolated house. It looks like a little bit of paradise though one that needs an armed guard." often as a source of palpable violent tension that simmers and simmers until it erupts without explanation or at times evident reason. Here violence explodes early in two thematically linked scenes one of Juan furiously beating a dog for an unspecified offense (mercifully this appears staged and takes place mostly off screen) and the other of a man Seven (Willebaldo Torres) hacking at a resplendent forest evergreen. Seven who lives in a concrete-block house and has an estranged wife and two children has done renovation work on Juan�۪s house. Although the two men are separated by class and social standing Mr. Reygadas also suggests they�۪re connected by deeper primal instincts." some wearing towels and others wearing nothing at all who roam through lounge in and copulate in a series of waggishly named rooms. Initially Juan and Natalia play voyeurs who with others impassively watch a gaggle of mostly off-screen participants engage in loudly comically orchestrated group sex. ���Shall we go?�۝ Juan asks Natalia as casually as a bored theatergoer. They do and after stopping by the Hegel Room (no dialectics just sluggish nudists) they enter the Duchamp Room first passing French-speaking swingers smoking cigarettes. Inside the room as Juan watches Natalia finds pleasure and in a Piet�� pose maybe the sacred." even if he has made it clear that Juan functions as a kind of authorial place holder and possibly a close filmmaker surrogate. This isn�۪t apparent from anything in the actual film but in interviews he has explained that he shot part of ���Post Tenebras Lux�۝ in and around his house an airy multistory modern affair set in a lush mountainous region in south-central Mexico. Mr. Reygadas�۪s children Rut and Eleazar also play Juan�۪s children. (In scenes in which the children appear older the roles are played by others.) Like Mr. Reygadas Juan comes from money and unlike most of the area�۪s inhabitants looks to be of white European ancestry rather than of Indian descent." nature and culture sex and money man and beast God and the Devil ��� ���Post Tenebras Lux�۝ embraces the world even if it doesn�۪t open itself up to ready interpretation. That�۪s partly because Mr. Reygadas wants his viewers to work it out themselves and partly because he throws up roadblocks including a distorting camera lens abruptly inserted images of British boys playing rugby (Mr. Reygadas attended school in Britain) and a timeline that�۪s as piecemeal as memory. The film doesn�۪t unfold linearly but instead jumps from one moment to the next the different periods indicated primarily by Juan�۪s changing hairstyles and the children�۪s ages. Everything in the film may be in the past or may just be in the eternal magnificent maddening present that is Mr. Reygadas�۪s consciousness."

Written as a monologue it is a somewhat claustrophobic blurt of a book that given world events continues to feel eerily timely. The monologue is delivered by Changez ��� a young Pakistani university lecturer grievously possibly violently disenchanted with the United States ��� to an unnamed American who may be some kind of United States operative. Seated in a Lahore restaurant Changez essentially keeps the mystery man (and the reader) captive with his reminiscences of his American dreams and disappointments both in work and with a wealthy melancholic woman who rather like her country let him down." but it�۪s instructive when the results are as thuddingly crude as Mira Nair�۪s take on ���The Reluctant Fundamentalist.�۝ Blunt where the novel is subtle it follows its source in outline with Changez (a fine Riz Ahmed) narrating his tale to the stranger here a journalist with a preposterous name Bobby Lincoln (Liev Schreiber) and a fairly clear-cut relationship with the American government: he�۪s seeking information about a kidnapped American. Now when the men sit down together they are in the gun sights of a C.I.A. team led by an operative Ludlow Cooper (Martin Donovan) who�۪s keeping up a second conversation with Lincoln through an earpiece and cellphone calls." their guns the sweat pouring off them the urgency of their voices and gestures ��� an urgency mirrored by the restless camerawork brusque edits and percussive music ��� give these scenes the flavor of a thriller. They have no parallel in the book in which a glint of metal from inside a man�۪s jacket telegraphs potential violence to come. Ms. Nair�۪s decision to pump up Mr. Hamid�۪s story with genre elements partly registers as a pragmatic commercial decision as a way to package and sell ideas about American power and subaltern identities. And there�۪s no question that the images and sounds of guns being cocked as well as black S.U.V.�۪s hurtling heavily armed American agents through dusty Pakistani streets add evocative jolts to the movie and its advertising." she also completely drains it of ambiguity. As in the novel the movie follows Changez after he graduates from Princeton finds success working for a company that estimates the value of other firms (and shuts down the failing ones) and falls in love with Erica (a miscast Kate Hudson). After Sept. 11 though he begins to see himself a stranger in a strange land and alienated from America and its conquering (call it fundamentalist) capitalism. ���In this constant striving to realize a financial future �۝ he says in the book ���no thought was given to the critical personal and political issues that affect one�۪s emotional present.�۝" in a pivotal scene midway through the novel Changez (Genghis in Urdu) also says that he smiled when he watched images of the twin towers collapsing on Sept. 11. ���Yes despicable as it may sound my initial reaction was to be remarkably pleased.�۝ He was Changez continues caught up in ���the symbolism of it all the fact that someone had so visibly brought America to her knees.�۝ The shock of that smile and its meaning ��� is this the admission of an ordinary aggrieved man or a terrorist? ��� reverberates through the remainder of the book. Even before that smile though Changez isn�۪t especially likable but then he wasn�۪t written to make readers feel comfortable. He�۪s a narrative conceit in a novel that puts different fundamentalisms into dialectical play." by contrast does what she often does in her movies: working from a screenplay by William Wheeler she delivers a lesson in multiculturalism turning a difficult fairly acid story into an occasion for some finger-wagging. As usual she ornaments her didacticism with some attractive trim: there is handsome cinematography from Declan Quinn a vivid palette and some memorable music notably a thrillingly beautiful Sufi song from Fareed Ayaz and Abu Muhammad. For eight minutes these extraordinary singers ��� who are performing for Changez�۪s family in Pakistan ��� transport you even as Ms. Nair insistently unfortunately brings you back to earth by cutting between their performance and images of an American being kidnapped in Lahore.

I wish I could tell you that ���The Numbers Station�۝ rises to that challenge but despite nabbing John Cusack for its lead this dreary spy drama is as flat and airless as the concrete bunker in which it unfolds." that bunker is so poorly lighted that it�۪s a wonder that anything decipherable is ever transmitted." a flowy-haired cryptologist who broadcasts codes into a microphone behind a plexiglass panel like a D.J. who�۪s unaware that all the clubbers have gone home. Watching over her is Emerson (Mr. Cusack) a broody C.I.A. hit man exiled to the station after failing to kill an innocent witness to one of his assassinations." which is all we will learn about either character. Consequently their peril when they arrive one morning to find the station breached and bloodied bodies adding pops of color to the gray flooring carries no emotional weight. Managing neither espionage nor romance convincingly the director Kasper Barfoed leaves Mr. Cusack no outlet for his signature quick-tongued charm relying on a script (by F. Scott Frazier) that hews almost exclusively to clipped exposition." Emerson�۪s doleful flirting with Katherine releases less heat than a Match.com profile; even when tending her gashed and trembling thigh he seems more intrigued by the shrapnel in the wound than the flesh beneath his hands." explosions and a fire extinguisher in the face. Viewers just suffer."

An intimate look into the global phenomenon of sex tourism it subjects both its characters and its audience to a series of humiliations in a manner that is at once prurient and punitive. Mr. Seidl shows us human bodies stripped of clothes and dignity and then shames us for looking." these nonactors function less as characters than as tokens in the director�۪s passive-aggressive blame game. If you regard them as grotesque pitiable or in some way ���other�۝ ��� which is to say exactly as they are filmed ��� perhaps you should examine your conscience."

The middle-aged single mother of a sullen teenage daughter Teresa treats herself to a birthday trip to a resort on the coast of Kenya.

Once she crosses the barrier to walk along the beach the men swarm around her hawking shells and jewelry. Outside the resort�۪s main entrance other men on motorbikes offer rides." intricate choreography of these pursuits brilliantly conveying both Teresa�۪s confusion and excitement and the sense that she is participating in an elaborate well-established ritual. She feels at first like the prey but of course she is also a predator searching for a body to feed her desires." with a young man from the beach named Gabriel (Gabriel Mwarua) does not go very well. Mr. Seidl�۪s blunt unsparing depiction of embarrassment and sexual failure is a sign of what is to come as Teresa starts to get the hang of the sugar-mama game entering into a relationship with a soft-spoken dreadlocked young man named Munga (Peter Kazungu). Part of the ritual seems to be that the transactional nature of these affairs is addressed obliquely. Rather than demand payment for sexual services the men court their clients with ardent declarations of love and lust and then a bit later ask for help paying for a relative�۪s medical care or some other emergency." commerce and emotion are not so easily kept apart and in the course of her vacation Teresa becomes both more cynical and more vulnerable. She treats her potential and actual lovers with sometimes brutal contempt an assertion of her own power that is also an acknowledgment of their power to hurt her feelings." which is also about European women looking for fun in the tropics (though in Haiti rather than Africa). Mr. Cantet while aware of the ugly economic and social realities of sex tourism does not entirely dispel the aura of romantic erotic allure that Mr. Seidl so effectively shatters. In ���Paradise: Love �۝ he looks at bodies whether fleshy and pink or lean and brown with a gaze intent on stripping away their dignity." even if the people they are impersonating are fictional. Several scenes in ���Paradise: Love�۝ ��� especially an impromptu orgy and its sad aftermath ��� step into an ethical gray area as Mr. Seidl makes demands of his performers that seem very hard to defend on moral or artistic grounds. And yet there is no denying the seriousness of his intentions or the clarity of his vision. The question is whether in depicting degradation he is also enacting it.

Eric Atlan�۪s ���Mortem�۝ inhabits the French tradition of philosophical fantasy so indelibly expressed by Jean Cocteau. Heady with hotel room metaphysics and luxuriating in its two doll-eyed Ukrainian leads Mr. Atlan�۪s spare black-and-white film has that unfortunate double-edged quality of such singularly focused exercises: artful or if the spell doesn�۪t take overwrought and even silly." �۝ the messengers of death ride motorcycles and the action of the nondenominational ���Mortem�۝ begins with a blond civilian Jena (Daria Panchenko) speeding on hers into the woods. Stopping for the night at an empty inn turns out to have extraordinarily high-stakes consequences. There in a locked room a trash-talking brunette sylph (Diana Rudychenko) who shadows Jena�۪s every move forces a reckoning with her soul. Over what feels like one endless night Jena goes through the stages of spiritual confusion: thinking she hears voices trying to get away and making out with her double." and the dedicated leads seem at times a little slight for the staging of a struggle at eternity�۪s edge. But it�۪s hard to want to bash Mr. Atlan�۪s devoted throwback which clearly subscribes to a line uttered here in rebuke: ���Sarcasm is for the living not us.�۝"

�۝ it would take a razzle-dazzle entertainer with Bollywood flair and a literary bent someone equally at home with comedy and allegory ghosts and little snot-nosed boys Indian history and Indian myth." through some kind of hocus-pocus abracadabra (Mr. Rushdie is fond of pileups and lists without commas) a directorial equivalent of the author would need to be conjured. But there�۪s little magic and even less sense of the storyteller as magician in the modest respectful adaptation directed by Deepa Mehta a filmmaker whose socially engaged naturalism seems a mismatch with Mr. Rushdie�۪s gleeful too-muchness." Mr. Rushdie who wrote the screenplay (and does the curiously flat voice-over) meets Ms. Mehta halfway. In wrestling his bursting-at-the-seams sometimes wearying epic into movie-acceptable size he has pared it of authorial quirks and compressed it lopping off subplots and characters and flights of fancy." from beginning to end with none of the novel�۪s compulsive prognosticating and backward glancing. That may suit the straightforward style of Ms. Mehta (���Fire �۝ ���Earth �۝ ���Water�۝) but it makes for a movie that if never exactly dull feels drained of the mythic juice that powers the book which won the Booker Prize in 1981." the characters march in a now-this now-that way through history from the early part of the 20th century to independence to the days after Indira Gandhi�۪s state of emergency in the �۪70s and dart around the subcontinent from Kashmir to Agra to Bombay to West Pakistan to East Pakistan (soon to be Bangladesh)." about India is told through a smaller one about a family and especially one boy: Saleem Sinai born at the stroke of the midnight hour on Aug. 15 1947 the very moment of India�۪s birth as a free country. There are 1 001 children born at that hour all with special powers but many have died by the time Saleem (Darsheel Safary as a boy; Satya Bhabha as an adult) discovers that he can hear the other children�۪s voices in his head as if he were some kind of all-India radio. (That�۪s his power one of the best.)" contentious meetings the camera�۪s focus goes soft which seems fitting as the children are mostly indistinct here practically an afterthought and without much metaphorical power. When ���the Widow�۝ ��� Mrs. Gandhi (Sarita Choudhury) ��� persecutes them during her Emergency you wonder why she bothers." they take a back seat to Saleem and his family�۪s story. There are infants switched at birth ��� one rich one poor ��� revelations about parenthood amnesia war riots sudden shifts in fortune and most satisfyingly a kind of mother-son reunion between Saleem and his ayah that would do a Bombay talkie proud." his mother (Shahana Goswami) and the ayah (Seema Biswas) ��� the perpetrator of that baby switching ��� give the film emotional ballast that�۪s lost when Saleem leaves for Pakistan." even more evident in its stripped-bare state Mr. Rushdie and Ms. Mehta have avoided the temptation of turning ���Midnight�۪s Children�۝ into an ersatz Bollywood production. That�۪s probably wise. But the film needs an injection of Bollywood�۪s unembarrassed anything-goes bigger-than-life spirit which embraces willy-nilly ��� as does Mr. Rushdie�۪s novel ��� the vulgar the fanciful and the frankly unbelievable."

aggressive muscle-headed entertainment is Mr. Bay�۪s specialty after all and while this grisly true-crime drama is partly about performance-enhancing drugs and the bulky men who love them it is also compared with ���Armageddon�۝ or the ���Transformers�۝ series a stripped-down modest enterprise in which no major American city is reduced to rubble." written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and based on a series of articles by Pete Collins (published in Miami New Times) is in any way subtle or restrained. The opening scene a police chase from which the rest of the story flashes back sets a tone of hectic excess. Mark Wahlberg running from the heavily armed forces of law and order dashes across rooftops and lumbers sometimes in slow motion through streets and alleys. The camera swirls around him freezing as a glob of saliva pops out of his mouth dropping down to allow us a peek up his nostrils and then tilting and sliding to register the impact of his face on the windshield of a car." blood and cheerful nasty vulgarity punctuated by voice-over ruminations about Jesus physical fitness and the American dream along with a few tactical visits to a strip club. It all leaves you pondering whether you have just seen a monumentally stupid movie or a brilliant movie about the nature and consequences of stupidity." �۝ though it compresses some events and characters hews fairly close to the facts as related in Mr. Collins�۪s deadpan chronicle of idiotic criminality and sloppy police work. Mr. Wahlberg plays Daniel Lugo a personal trainer and bodybuilding enthusiast who lands a job at a Miami gym after serving time for an investment scam. Swearing that he has learned his lesson ��� that there is no substitute for hard work ��� he sets his sights on a South Florida vision of the good life egged on by a self-help guru (Ken Jeong) who fills his head with slogans and three-point plans for success. ���If I deserve it �۝ Daniel says ���then the universe will serve it.�۝" �۝ Grand Theft Auto and the oeuvre of Michael Bay might demand though since ���Pain & Gain�۝ is set in 1995 not all of those inspirations are available to Daniel. But the world then as now is full of hot babes fast cars and money tokens of a high-rolling hedonistic existence just beyond poor Daniel�۪s reach. He is motivated less by ambition than by a self-pitying sense of entitlement that is both democratic and Nietzschean. He says that he wants to be just like everybody else but also that he wants to set himself apart from the losers and suckers in whose ranks he unfairly languishes." Daniel spots a ticket out of palookaville in the person of Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) a pigeon-chested blowhard who hires Daniel to help him get into shape and brags endlessly about his offshore bank accounts his boat his mansion and the sandwich franchise near the airport that for some reason is his pride and joy. Victor is enough of a jerk that it is hard to feel too bad when Daniel enlists two fellow gym rats ��� Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul (Dwayne Johnson) ��� to kidnap him. Rather than demand ransom they decide to torture him into signing his assets over to them." a nurse who specializes in such ailments. Paul an ex-convict who has found religion is a bit less clear about what he wants and he clings to a sense of his own righteousness even after some dramatic backsliding. Some of this occurs in the company of Sorina (Bar Paly) a Romanian-born stripper who had previously dated Daniel and who believes that he and his partners are government agents on a dangerous top-secret mission." which might count as an offensive stereotype if the guys she hung around with had any brains to speak of. Daniel likens himself to Tony Montana in ���Scarface�۝ or Michael Corleone in the Godfather pictures but he and his accomplices ��� including his boss played by Rob Corddry ��� would be more at home in ���Dumb and Dumber.�۝ Not that the local representatives of law and order are especially clever. The gang blunders from one disaster to another with results that are sometimes horrifying sometimes hilarious and sometimes both. More absurd and more shocking is how much they get away with. You start to believe that Daniel may be right that the universe is organized to reward amoral shallow cretins like him." a private detective who seems to be the only decent reasonably intelligent person in all of South Florida does not do much to challenge this idea. Mr. Harris is as always an admirable actor but the other guys ��� the slobbery hammy Mr. Shalhoub; the manic weirdly sweet Mr. Mackie; the histrionically nervous Mr. Johnson; and the buff dense irritable Mr. Wahlberg ��� are much more fun." while not exactly glorifying the crimes of the Sun Gym gang does not entirely condemn them either. A different kind of director might have made ���Pain & Gain�۝ into a gamy gritty sunshine noir or else a knowing satire of idiot America. The easy move would be to invite the audience to look down on Daniel Paul and Adrian but Mr. Bay�۪s brand of populism holds them rigorously and maddeningly at eye level. The movie and by implication those of us watching it are no better than these guys. I found that unspeakably insulting and also impressive." violence drugs and other stupid stuff."

the fictionalized true-tale ���Kon-Tiki�۝ charts what sounds like at least on paper a remarkable journey. In 1947 a Norwegian zoologist and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl (Pal Sverre Hagen) set sail for Polynesia from Peru in a balsa-wood raft that he called Kon-Tiki after a sun god. Heyerdahl (1914-2002) had lived in Polynesia in the late 1930s and through his studies had developed some unorthodox ideas about early migrations to the islands. Unlike other researchers who embraced the theory that Polynesia had been populated by way of Asia Heyerdahl argued that the islanders originated in South America." and apparently advance his reputation in an overwhelmingly skeptical unsympathetic professional world Heyerdahl built the kind of raft that he believed early South American seafarers might have constructed. He then set sail with five other men four Norwegians and a Swede who in the movie register as more or less indistinguishable sunburned blonds. After 101 days they landed on the Raroia Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago. Thereafter Heyerdahl became a media star: his book ���The Kon-Tiki Expedition �۝ was translated into multiple languages and a 1950 documentary about the expedition won an Oscar. He went on to other adventures which are documented at the helpful Web site for the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo." and one that is not seriously engaged in the movie. In the 2009 book ���The Wayfinders: Why Ancient Wisdom Matters in the Modern World �۝ the anthropologist Wade Davis writes that Heyerdahl ���inverted history itself�۝ with his claims about the Polynesian migration. ���In making his sensational claim �۝ Mr. Davis writes ���Thor Heyerdahl ignored the overwhelming body of linguistic ethnographic and ethnobotanical evidence augmented today by genetic and archaeological data indicating that he was patently wrong.�۝ That sounds like grounds for another kind of film one that would necessarily take a less heroic more complex approach toward science its uses and possible abuses." with a script by Petter Skavlan ���Kon-Tiki�۝ is instead a stolidly old-fashioned and manly hair-in-the-wind entertainment of the sort that could have filled out the bottom of a studio double bill. The men are handsome the sea is pretty and if the sharks look as rubbery as last week�۪s chicken at least they add some drama ��� and buckets of sloshing blood and guts ��� to what otherwise proves a dull affair. (It�۪s also a distracting affair because in a misguided move the filmmakers have the men speak in English; there�۪s also a Norwegian-language version.) There�۪s no denying the real Heyerdahl�۪s bravery but if this movie is to be believed his voyage was largely bereft of tension and interesting conversation. It�۪s hard not to compare it unfavorably to Ang Lee�۪s ���Life of Pi �۝ which however flawed lyrically conveyed the beauty and madness of a long journey into both the world and the soul."

Ind. where Arthur/Wallace has a standing offer to be the resident golf pro at a club. He is leaving behind a 13-year-old son from a former marriage and a girlfriend (Anne Heche) who doesn�۪t seem unduly upset about his disappearance. The movie�۪s ambiguous scenes of these people from his former life bring the movie to a dead halt." he is a little too glamorous for the role of a despairing middle-aged milquetoast with a streak of kindness. Although Ms. Blunt struggles to create a coherent character Michaela is less a human being than a bundle of contradictory tics." she thinks up a game in which they spot interesting-looking couples break into their homes dress up in their clothes and pretend to be them. If these scenes give the actors a chance to demonstrate their chameleonic skills they are not especially funny or developed enough to illuminate the theme of identity. Arthur is carrying a large bag of money and the movie also toys fruitlessly with the possibility that Michaela might steal it." with its anonymous strip malls and flimsy motels: a cheerless wasteland with no identity whatsoever."

direct title for a transcendently lovely and delicate work created from images that didn�۪t make it into the filmed diaries he made from 1960 to 2000. During those years he produced some of his most enduring films like ���Walden�۝ and ���Lost Lost Lost.�۝ He also published ���I Had Nowhere to Go �۝ his often haunting memoir that traces his early life as a Lithuanian refugee during World War II and his later struggles both as a displaced person in Europe after the war and then as an immigrant living working yearning and shooting his first films in New York City." and few have given as generously to American film culture. It was Mr. Mekas who in 1963 published Andrew Sarris�۪s landmark essay on the auteur theory in Film Culture a journal founded by Mr. Mekas and his brother Adolfas. By that point Jonas Mekas had been working through own his ideas on the art and rejecting what writing in his column in The Village Voice he condemned as ���official dead conventional cinema.�۝" the dawning of the New American Cinema as filmmakers declared their aesthetic and industrial independence. As Mr. Mekas and some like-minded souls feverishly put it in a 1962 statement ���We don�۪t want rosy films ��� we want them the color of blood.�۝" though it sometimes pricks the skin. In tone mood and image quality it is suffused with light. At times it is brightened by sunshine that poured through windows of the SoHo loft in which once upon a Manhattan time Mr. Mekas lived with his young family several cats a lot of plants many more books and stacks and stacks of film cans and boxes. The streaming sun turned hair into halos and illuminated faces and rooms. It also flowed through Mr. Mekas�۪s camera inscribing shadow images of these children those plants the dancing cats that smiling woman on the loops of film he has now returned to." �۝ Mr. Mekas doesn�۪t I think say the woman�۪s name (Hollis Melton) perhaps because it�۪s too private or painful or just incidental to the way she looked at his camera back then. She appears throughout the movie along with their children Oona and Sebastian and together they present an unposed casually intimate portrait of domestic tranquillity. Every so often one two or three will walk on a city sidewalk or in some country greenery. She looks at the camera more than the children who often ignore it as if it were any other household appliance which it was. Only once does a child seem irked by the camera�۪s presence or possibly the man behind it; whatever the case it jerkily shifts view a move suggestive of a hurriedly averted gaze." with films like Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie�۪s ���Pull My Daisy�۝ pointing the way toward true independence Mr. Mekas shifted his sightlines from the commercial cinema and its restrictions. In a 1959 Voice column he wrote ���We need less perfect but more free films.�۝ Art and industry must be decoupled: ���There is no other way to break the frozen cinematic conventions than through a complete derangement of the official cinematic senses.�۝ He lived what he wrote and over time broke free too developing a deeply personal palpably handmade style in diary films in which the past jostled against the present and the thrum of everyday life became an occasion for ecstatic reverie." part memento mori ���Out-Takes�۝ is also a blast back to Mr. Mekas�۪s earlier bohemian past. Although much of its focus is on his wife and children his extended family is also represented in the form of the literary likes of Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs and filmmakers like Ken Jacobs and Peter Kubelka. Every so often Mr. Mekas slips in contemporary images of himself at a table winding reels and splicing together bits of films. Before movies were edited on computers they were cut with a blade and the resultant pieces often joined together with glue or tape a labor-intensive task. He looks like a factory worker at that table which seems paradoxical given that he abandoned industrial filmmaking but it also fits his cinematic labors of love." the past and memory play considerable roles in Mr. Mekas�۪s moving pictures pressing insistently against the present as suggested by the titles of films like ���Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania.�۝ It�۪s unsurprising given the material in ���Out-Takes From the Life of a Happy Man�۝ and the movie�۪s confessional-sounding title that Mr. Mekas is again sifting through the past. Yet while these are friends and fragments from his own life as these images skip and scatter across the screen they also convey a universal sense of memory." speaking in his still-heavily accented English announces that these images are not memories but reality a declaration that late in the movie opens up a Pandora�۪s box of philosophical questions about the nature of film and memory. Like so much of his life�۪s work the movie is a gift from a man who in between making films and writing about them helped establish both the Film-Makers�۪ Cooperative and Anthology Film Archives. It�۪s at Anthology that this most-happy man ��� who turned 90 in December ��� will appear on Thursday with ���Out-Takes From the Life of a Happy Man.�۝ If you go see this beautiful movie you can wish him a belated happy birthday and then thank him for everything that he�۪s done."

This turn of events makes allegorical sense yet defies credibility. But if ���At Any Price�۝ overstates its points they are still worth making.

wackos and wastrels ���Oconomowoc�۝ has one thing going for it: a running time of just 79 minutes even if every one of them feels like an eternity." this pointless wallow in man-child misery unites three unappetizing specimens in what only the most magnanimous viewer would call a plot. Travis (Andy Gillies who also wrote and directed) shaggy-haired and lamebrained finds his T-shirt business threatened by a middle school entrepreneur. His friend Lonnie (Brendan Marshall-Rashid) a limp prodigal son whose homecoming is barely noticed by his sozzled mother is no help preferring the company of a pretty pharmacist (Cindy Pinzon) whose options must be severely limited." however is Todd (Andrew Rozanski) Lonnie�۪s doughy stepfather who spends most of the movie overflowing a selection of tight briefs beneath a spotted bathrobe. Together these three sad sacks do little and talk about less ��� while still managing to step on one another�۪s lines ��� occasionally egged on by the burps and wails of the soundtrack�۪s improvised songs. (Pertinent lyric: ���My brain is disintegrating.�۝)" as long as you have something new to contribute. But Mr. Gillies who cites Wes Anderson and Tim Burton as influences is as lacking in ideas as in technique." it�۪s not my fault �۝ he tells us in the publicity notes. ���Blame yourself ��� or someone else.�۝ I think he�۪s trying to be funny."

�۝ a lackluster science-fiction adventure with Tom Cruise that even before its opening was groaning under the weight of its hard-working slowly fading star and a title that invites mockery of him and it both. The agony of being a longtime Tom Cruise fan has always been a burden but now it�۪s just well dispiriting. You not only have to ignore the din of the tabloids and swat away the buzzing generated by his multiple headline-ready dramas you also have to come to grips with the harsh truth that it no longer actually matters why and how Tom Terrific became less so. No one else much cares." despite occasional attempts to lighten up as in the recent would-be satire ���Rock of Ages.�۝ Midway through ���Oblivion�۝ I wondered when I had last believed there was something true in his laugh something that felt either genuinely expansive or intimate as in ���Jerry Maguire �۝ or chilled with a hint of madness as in ���Magnolia.�۝ Mind you he doesn�۪t have many occasions to laugh in ���Oblivion �۝ a gray post-apocalyptic tale with rainbow accents yet when he does it feels uncomfortably forced. In those moments was he worrying that the movie wasn�۪t going to return him to the box office summit? He�۪s 50 years old and too young to be prepping for a slow fade yet what are his choices?" after the 2010 release ���Tron: Legacy.�۝ That special effects-laden fantasy a musty hero�۪s journey largely distinguished by the yawning divide between its poor quality and its $170 million price tag was a flat line of a dud in almost every respect. It nonetheless made enough money to shore up an exploitable franchise property and spawn a sequel and while this may not sound like much of an achievement box office success or the perception of it can beget more opportunities in the movie business which may help explain ���Oblivion.�۝" long after a cataclysmic war between earthlings and extraterrestrials. Nuked to all but radioactive ash the Earth has been rendered nearly uninhabitable and its remaining people have fled to a galactic shelter. The only ones left on the planet appear to be Jack Harper (Mr. Cruise) and his companion Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) who live in a cantilevered aerie above the clouds that brings to mind a ���Jetsons�۝ sky pad. His job is to repair drones that patrol the facilities that extract resources for the surviving populace and that are under attack from the aliens or Scavs as in scavengers. She monitors him back at their place waving her hands over a tabletop computer while in full makeup and rocking some fabulous end-of-days-to-night dresses and heels." you know the whole doomsday thing not to mention the glossiness of the couple�۪s floors. Then again from the way she strips for some late-night nuzzling her get-up does appear to have instrumental value even if one misstep and she or at least an ankle would be a goner. A similar kind of tricky balancing act is inherent in science fiction a genre that often employs recognizable details to tether readers and viewers in fantastical realms. It�۪s a form as is often noted that makes the strange familiar and the familiar strange a narrative principle that Mr. Kosinski embraces again and again with niceties like Jack�۪s Yankee baseball cap and Jack and Victoria�۪s candlelight dinners." as does that baseball cap. But because Mr. Kosinski hasn�۪t come up with a resonant idea to accompany them ��� a new or different way of looking at the world that exists and the world that might one day come into being ��� his retro flourishes prove as empty as the lunarlike landscapes. There�۪s an arresting moment for instance when Jack drives through a blasted-out terrain littered with ships partly submerged in earth a vista that demonstrates Mr. Kosinski�۪s fondness for playing with negative space. The vision of a man existentially alone conjures up countless cowboys traveling through innumerable westerns and summons up the shock of the half-buried Statue of Liberty in ���Planet of the Apes.�۝ Yet again Mr. Kosinski fails to build on his materials and the allusions soon fade." self-consciously or not on their progenitors. The problem with ���Oblivion �۝ which is based on an unpublished graphic novel Mr. Kosinski wrote and used to pitch the studio is that it�۪s been stitched together from bits and pieces that evoke numerous other far better far-out tales and ideas conceits and characters from the likes of Philip K. Dick the Wachowskis J. G. Ballard and Duncan Jones specifically his elegant elegiac movie ���Moon.�۝ No matter how hard Mr. Cruise squares his jaw or flings his body over and against the scenery and despite the presence of Morgan Freeman Olga Kurylenko and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who trickle into the story to aid in Jack�۪s journey ���Oblivion�۝ never transcends its inspirations to become anything other than a thin copy."

Though the movie (���Match Point�۝) is one in which Mr. Allen himself does not appear it is clear enough that Germain might be one of his lost alter egos a character ensnared by his own desires and a willful inability to distinguish reality from fantasy." the hapless literature professor in one of Mr. Allen�۪s classic comic sketches contrived to transport himself into the pages of ���Madame Bovary.�۝ Germain�۪s journey is not quite as surreal (or as funny) and the text he fixes on rather than a canonical work is a series of school assignments written by Claude (Ernst Umhauer) the only talented student in a class full of sullen mediocrities. But like poor Kugelmass Germain tumbles into a comic treacherous no man�۪s land between the literary and the literal." a quiet boy from a broken home is either cynically feeding his teacher�۪s obsession or giving voice to his own fantasies ��� or maybe both. In any case he narrates his increasingly complicated involvement with the family of a classmate Rapha (Bastien Ughetto) whose ���perfect normal�۝ two-parent household is very different from Claude�۪s. He is especially drawn to Rapha�۪s mother Esther (Emmanuelle Seigner) whom he idealizes and mocks as ���a woman of the middle classes �۝ and whom he views both as a maternal surrogate and as a potential Mrs. Robinson." ���In the House�۝ weaves a pleasant and clever spell manipulating the viewer much in the way that Claude plays with Germain. We are never quite sure if the boy is writing truth or fiction ��� the scenes he composes are no less ���real�۝ than anything else in the movie ��� or whether the remarkable events he reports are embellishments or outright inventions. Germain for his part loses sight of all such distinctions even as he tries to control the story by suggesting revisions or alternate plotlines." �۝ most memorably and by Mr. Luchini in ���Potiche.�۝ This disorientation can be comical somber or sinister and ���In the House�۝ tries for a blend of all these moods." mingling absurdity with suspense and finding an undercurrent of pathos in Claude�۪s brooding watchful temperament and Germain�۪s simmering frustration. But the dexterity of the actors and their director is not quite enough and as ���In the House�۝ accelerates it also starts to sputter piling on incidents and revelations that cause its web of implications to unravel." when you are impatient to learn what happens next and the possibilities seem to expand. At a certain point they begin to close down and if you are not moved you are likely to grow impatient. If you are like Germain that might drive you crazy; if not you might just start to feel tired."

For his art to remain truly and entertainingly deceptive his mysteries if not his mentors must remain inescapably secreted away." don�۪t expect Mr. Jay to explain where that ball coin or block of ice went or to reveal how those aces materialized from a deck of shuffled cards. ���Deceptive Practice �۝ which was directed by Molly Bernstein and Alan Edelstein doesn�۪t pull back the curtain on a wizard who would probably set it afire before it began to part. (This doesn�۪t seem an exaggeration particularly for a magician who earlier on cultivated a somewhat sinister persona by turning thrown cards into weapons.) Rather much as Mr. Jay has done in his writing the movie invites you to join one of his magical mystery tours as he entertainingly ambles through the histories of some of the prestidigitators who inspired him including mentors like Dai Vernon (1894-1992) and Charlie Miller (1909-1989)." Mr. Jay proves a hugely entertaining guide and as generous about his professional inspirations as he is reticent about his own life. He remains as discreet when it comes to his parents as he has been elsewhere including in Mark Singer�۪s excellent 1993 New Yorker profile. Even so to see and hear Mr. Jay gloss over the topic of his parents on camera resonates because both the rapidity and the deadpan with which he glides over the subject seems to speak to an unhealed wound an irreconcilable rift however quietly. He�۪s far more expansive on the topic of his maternal grandfather Max Katz an accountant and amateur magician who introduced his grandson to a dazzling group of entertainers and future mentors. By the age of 4 little Tricky Ricky was waving a wand." �۝ among other archival materials as well as talking-head interviews. Mr. Jay�۪s friend and sometimes collaborator David Mamet also materializes as do more traditional magicians none of whom dazzle as brightly as the movie�۪s subject."

The movie briefly turns into what feels like a documentary tutorial on high-end liquor production." ���The Angels�۪ Share�۝ abruptly transforms into a fanciful caper comedy in which Robbie and three collaborators from his work team don kilts and pose as Highlanders calling themselves the Carntyne Malt Whisky Club. Their goal is to steal liquor from a recently discovered cask of Malt Mill named for a long-shuttered distillery and scheduled to be auctioned off. On the day of the sale Robbie slips inside the distillery to spend the night siphoning a small amount of this nectar into empty soda bottles. Even without certified provenance the booze will command an enormous price because the nose knows. The movie gets in its digs at unscrupulous investors who are willing to pay more than a million pounds for the cask." ���The Angels�۪ Share�۝ offers a pungently realistic portrait of hopelessness and frustration which explode in vicious street fighting and petty crime. It is difficult to transcend this world where any attempts at upward mobility are likely to be thwarted by bitterly angry peers determined to make sure no one escapes." who comes from a similar background exhibits a scary volatility tempered with enough underlying sensitivity to make Robbie sympathetic despite his lack of self-control. In an environment this merciless self-control is a liability. If you don�۪t fight back you risk being beaten to death." Dougie (James Casey) is carrying on a feud of their fathers that he refuses to let it go.

As the victim near tears tells of the physical damage that cost him his sight in one eye Robbie looks down and weeps uncontrollably.

three in this century ��� it is usually possible to discern beneath the blossoms of metaphor and the philosophical foliage the trellis of a more or less conventional plot. ���The Thin Red Line�۝ is a combat picture. ���The Tree of Life�۝ is a nostalgic coming-of-age story. And ���To the Wonder �۝ Mr. Malick�۪s latest is a romantic melodrama whose major characters fall tragically and beautifully in and out of love." an Oklahoman named Neil (Ben Affleck) meets Marina (Olga Kurylenko) a Ukrainian expatriate with a 10-year-old daughter Tatiana (Tatiana Chiline). We first encounter Neil and Marina in the bliss of early infatuation and in endlessly picturesque (if also somewhat familiar) settings. Paris is a wonderland for cinematographers and Emmanuel Lubezki Mr. Malick�۪s director of photography (who also shot ���The Tree of Life�۝ and ���The New World�۝) revels in the city�۪s limestone buildings cobbled streets and the classical symmetries of its gardens. A trip west to Mont Saint-Michel is like a visit to heaven itself as the spires and buttresses of the cathedral and the tidal flats that surround it are rendered in one glorious composition after another." as a matter of quasi-religious principle and aesthetic temperament to finding beauty everywhere. When Marina and Tatiana follow Neil back to Oklahoma ���To the Wonder�۝ spins visual poetry not only out of prairies and creek beds but also out of less obviously sublime facts of the landscape like suburban subdivisions concrete parking structures and supermarkets. Nothing drab ugly or ordinary can exist in this world." Marina who occupies herself running through fields in golden sunlight finds rapture hard to sustain. Her malaise is mirrored by the struggle of a priest (Javier Bardem) to hold on to his faith. Marina and her daughter return to France and Neil takes up with Jane (Rachel McAdams) a rancher he knew in childhood." exotic and domestic impetuous and practical ��� is an ancient literary archetype which may be a polite way of saying a clich̩. In any case what Jane and Marina have in common apart from their attraction to Neil is a serious commitment to twirling. Not the highly disciplined marching-band baton-assisted kind but rather the languid flowing-dress-wearing I�۪m-so-in-tune-with-the-universe-that-I-will-never-get-dizzy kind." and there is nothing at all unpleasant about watching them spin. Mr. Affleck for his part squares his shoulders extends his lower jaw slightly forward (as if expelling a faint metaphysical burp) and walks in a straight line." moody and above all indecisive. At one point the priest reflects on the sinfulness of refusing to make a choice and while he is condemning himself Neil is implicated as well since he cannot fully devote himself to either of the women who adore him. Women in Mr. Malick�۪s films tend to love intuitively and completely if not always happily while men equivocate and brood occasionally erupting in anger or frustration." Mr. Malick minimizes dialogue preferring to communicate ideas and emotions through voice-over montage and music. (Hanan Townshend�۪s tense fluid score is supplemented by selections from the 19th- and 20th-century classical repertory.) The director�۪s methods serve the film�۪s theme which is the tension the imperfect alignment between human love and its divine correlative. Marina speaks more than once of ���the love that loves us �۝ echoing the priest�۪s longing to feel the connection to God identified in the Christian tradition as grace." swinging upward from earth to sky traces a path from the sensual to the spiritual and his men and women are blessed and cursed to inhabit both realms at once. In ���The Tree of Life�۝ he managed ��� to the bafflement of some and the rapt amazement of others (myself included) ��� to endow the details of individual lives with genuine awe and to afford even skeptics a view of existence from the perspective of eternity." gorgeous as they are do not in themselves possess the evocative power Mr. Malick intends them to have. He works in a shorthand that can sometimes feel facile rather than profound. Images of Neil�۪s work sampling soil and water at industrial sites and of poor and disabled Oklahomans appear as tokens rather than expressions of social and environmental concern. And the torsos the sun-dappled fields and the twirling ladies look more commercial than cosmic as if plucked from advertisements for perfume high-thread-count sheets or other luxury goods." and his insistence on finding a cinematic idiom that connects beauty to ultimate truth is noble and sincere. But the fine intentions of ���To the Wonder�۝ pave a road to puzzlement not awe."

This recycling of the central device from Herbert Ross�۪s ���Play It Again Sam�۝ (based on Mr. Allen�۪s Broadway play and featuring Humphrey Bogart as the romantic oracle) falls even flatter than the rest of the film�۪s dialogue (by the director Sophie Lellouche) and limping attempts at humor. A poorly written cameo for Mr. Allen only adds to our discomfort and were it not for the charming Patrick Bruel as a no-nonsense security expert and Alice�۪s unlikely suitor this spun-sugar concoction would be well nigh unwatchable."

but they feel fine even oblivious. That at any rate appears to be the principal really the only point of the impishly unfortunately titled ���It�۪s a Disaster �۝ an underbaked comedy about eight people facing their mortality. Set in the present it mostly unfolds in a Los Angeles house within gasping distance of a large-scale catastrophe of the kind usually let loose by masters of disaster like Roland Emmerich. The writer and director Todd Berger is working on a far smaller scale than his blockbuster brethren do and that may explain why he keeps calamitous details fuzzy using two corpses a Hazmat suit and a murder of crows to suggest the apocalyptic big picture." other than sending off the doomed with laughs. The hook is a couples�۪ brunch a regular get-together that none seem to enjoy yet nevertheless habitually attend mostly so they can complain about their lives spouses whatever. The couples include the unhappy hosts two swingers and two dullards who all feel as if they belonged in different movies. Such disconnectedness could be productive but Mr. Berger doesn�۪t want to exploit it or is blind to it. The liveliest most persuasively acted if oddly matched pair are played by Julia Stiles and David Cross. Their characters feel out of place too but benefit from narrative tension and the actors have timing presence and the good will that comes with some r̩sum̩s." Ms. Stiles conveys a sense of what it means to expect the worst while Mr. Cross entertainingly trips down an unexpected path one that suggests that Mr. Berger might have wrung more from his setup if he had gone far wider and weirder. Instead he tries to squeeze out pathos and sentimentality along with the largely unfunny ha-ha and hooting which leads to an unengaging confusion of characters and moods. The movie lurches from the improbably silly to the drearily so while the characters remain so emotionally and psychologically divorced from life that they might as well be zombies or sitcom stick figures. The movie�۪s unrelenting visual drabness only adds to the unfortunate sense that while the end will come soon for them it isn�۪t coming anywhere near fast enough."

Parked in the back with Nat Greta initially seems wary then skeptical and suspicious." the writer and director Olivia Silver sticks close and then closer to Greta letting the story emerge through her watchful eyes. Working with the cinematographer Eric Lin and a script that hews to the familiar writing faith that it�۪s better to show than to tell Ms. Silver creates an air of believable domestic intimacy. Much of the story unfolds inside the station wagon restricted quarters that could have felt overly claustrophobic and tipped the story into drearier more psychodramatically blunt realms but instead feels as natural and comfortable with all the pleasant and prickly associations as a family dinner table. And by tracing the relay of looks and gestures Ms. Silver fills in the narrative blanks nicely." particularly with Tom�۪s often-unconvincing conservative political asides when a shot of him holding a fat wet cigar stub or yelling into a phone does more to suggest his character. Mr. Hawkes doesn�۪t have a lot to do ��� this is Greta�۪s story not Tom�۪s ��� but even when he doesn�۪t say much he adds layers to the movie. His coiled tenseness suggests complications even violence for instance that Ms. Silver is reluctant to make manifest in the script. There�۪s a recessive quality to her storytelling that while it creates a feeling of drift that sometimes makes sense especially with Greta�۪s moody burgeoning adolescence and mounting uncertainty about Tom can feel borrowed from the annals of art cinema." the coming-of-age story. Effectively a genre these stories of young awakening take different forms (neo-classic contemporary art-film elliptical) have many moods (angry wistful nostalgic) and deliver various lessons many of which turn on the same realization: Your parents are people but you will survive and forgive their bad choices. Greta learns much in ���Arcadia �۝ some of it overly obvious and as with many characters in American independent cinema her horizons don�۪t extend beyond the personal. Even so Ms. Silver�۪s ability to translate the liminal into cinematic terms to catch those moments between innocence and knowing childhood and adulthood unforgiving and forgiving makes her someone to watch."

One of the biggest differences between father and son is that the father likes a little mess in his gore. In ���Antiviral�۝ the son creates a hypersanitized environment in which the infection spreads from within." humorless satire of modern celebrity obsession is so impeccably clean that its white interiors suggest a hospital fashion shoot in which not the tiniest speck of dirt is visible. Its ingenious premise visualizes a culture where those seeking intimate contact with the young beautiful and famous can visit a clinic and pay big bucks to be injected with viruses drawn from the bodies of the elite. By contracting the illnesses from which these stars have recently recovered clients can have their idols ���inside�۝ them." ���cell steaks�۝ ��� cuts of meat somehow created from celebrity tissue ��� are available for purchase at a specialty butcher shop. This pallid high-priced flesh looks as repellent as a sliced corpse crawling with maggots. A 24-hour television network relays gossip about body parts mostly in the nether regions of the starlets of the moment. In one corner of the screen the date reads 2011 although Karim Hussain�۪s stark cinematography gives ���Antiviral�۝ a futuristic post-apocalyptic ambience. The prominent colors are white and red." queasy-making images are extreme close-ups of needles penetrating flesh; a single pale blue eye of the movie�۪s deathly white cadaverous heavily freckled protagonist Syd March (Caleb Landry Jones); and mouths smeared with blood from oral injections." who never smiles and wears his reddish-brown hair tied in a knot works as an oily pharmacological salesman at the Lucas Clinic a private hospital whose clients are invited to choose from samples of the latest celebrity viruses. Every infection is secured through copy protection and anyone working there must pass through elaborate security." the sullen rebellious Syd has developed a sideline smuggling viruses out of the clinic by injecting them into his body processing them at home on an elaborate gizmo and selling them to Arvid (Joe Pingue) a butcher who runs a black market operation. Arvid is a key player in a cutthroat underworld of industrial espionage." rumored to be from China that has sickened the latest ���it�۝ girl Hannah Geist (Sarah Gadon). But in this case there is no cure. As Hannah�۪s condition worsens a funeral is staged while she is still alive apparently for commercial reasons." and you long for a little action or at least some fresh air. Mr. Jones�۪s performance is a considerable feat of agonized acting in which overcome by Hannah�۪s virus he is racked by fits of hallucinatory delirium." ���Antiviral�۝ doesn�۪t know where to go or how to break out of its vacuum-sealed sepulcher and Syd even when vomiting blood remains as incorporeal and creepy as a ghost. This is a movie that drinks its own tainted blood."

scandalous feet-of-clay expos̩s and rarest of all narratives that link sports with significant nonathletic historical events and social issues. In America those events and issues almost always have to do with race which makes the life of Jackie Robinson especially ripe for sweeping comprehensive treatment." �۝ Brian Helgeland�۪s new film about Robinson gestures toward the complicated and painful history in which its subject was embroiled it belongs like most sports biopics in the first category. It is blunt simple and sentimental using time-tested methods to teach a clear and rousing lesson." let�۪s say or even Clint Eastwood�۪s ��� ���42�۝ might have taken a tougher more contentious look at the breaking of Major League Baseball�۪s color barrier. But Mr. Helgeland whose previous directing credits include ���Payback�۝ and ���A Knight�۪s Tale�۝ (and who wrote ���Blood Work�۝ and ���Mystic River �۝ speaking of Clint Eastwood) has honorably sacrificed the chance to make a great movie in the interest of making one that is accessible and inspiring. Though not accurate in every particular the movie mostly succeeds in respecting the facts of history and the personality of its hero and in reminding audiences why he mattered." square rhythm. By then we have met Robinson played with sly charm and a hint of stubborn prickliness by Chadwick Boseman." a four-sport athlete at U.C.L.A. and a commissioned Army officer during World War II Robinson has been selected by Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) to become the first African-American major leaguer of the modern era. After some time with the Dodgers�۪ minor-league affiliate in Montreal Robinson now married and with a baby (his wife Rachel is played by Nicole Beharie) starts at first base wearing No. 42 for the Dodgers on opening day in 1947." �۝ for instance ��� but ���42�۝ does a good job of dramatizing the salient emotions of the moment and the racism that surrounded Robinson and every other black American of his time. To his credit Mr. Helgeland avoids the trap that so many depictions of the Jim Crow era fall into which is to imply that racial prejudice was an individual or regional pathology rather than a national social norm." the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies ��� their actions are treated not as exceptions to the rule but as especially ugly instances of it. Robinson is threatened and harassed by vigilantes and police officers in Florida during his first spring training but white fans in the North Brooklyn included are hardly shy about showering him with boos and slurs when he takes the field." and rival owners call Rickey demanding the same thing." a world that is still frequently given in movies and on television a glow of nostalgic innocence." here embodied by Rickey the Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca (Hamish Linklater) ��� one of the only Brooklyn players to shake Robinson�۪s hand when he first walks into the locker room ��� and the shortstop Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) whose public embrace of Robinson before a game in Cincinnati is the emotional high point of the movie. But ���42�۝ does not give these men disproportionate credit for passing a fairly easy test of character that most of the country was proud to fail and it does not pretend that Robinson�۪s story is really theirs." Robinson is surrounded by hostility and by people who even if they are on his side cannot begin to understand his experience. When Rickey describes his new player as ���superhuman �۝ he is bestowing a curse in the form of praise and identifying a paradox central to postwar racial politics. To be accepted as human as equal to whites the black pioneers of the era had to rise above all kinds of ordinary human temptations ��� to fight back to show anger or fear ��� and become flawless exemplars of their race." the film�۪s undisputed hero is in some ways its least interesting character. Rickey is a cigar-chomping Scripture-spouting old coot; Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) the Dodgers�۪ manager is a cynical womanizer who speaks in cracked aphorisms while the radio broadcaster Red Barber (a wonderful John C. McGinley) extemporizes jewels of English prose." the main African-American figures in the story ��� Jackie Rachel and the journalist Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) ��� seem a little stiff unable to be themselves in their own story. Which may just be to say that the cultural transformation in which Jackie Robinson played a significant early role is still incomplete." including racial epithets."

�۝ a drama so modest and trusting of its two leads that any directing flourishes might have shattered its spell." the filmmakers Eleanor Burke and Ron Eyal keep their rhythms slow and their camera steady as two lonely souls form a fragile connection. Oona (Bridget Collins) a recent graduate in anthropology has returned to her dead mother�۪s seaside cottage in southern England to prepare it for sale. Her arrival disturbs Mani (Adeel Akhtar) a wary vagrant who has been squatting on the property. Alarm becomes compassion ��� or perhaps just an unrecognized need for company ��� and Oona makes a series of gestures that will transform both their lives." we feel the isolating weight of grief and the solace of channeling it in an unexpected direction. Mani�۪s past may be as murky as his bath water but he understands the emotional thicket between one generation and another and his scenes with Oona vibrate with intuitive kinship. According to the publicity notes neither actor was given access to the entire script so they were forced to perform without knowing how their characters would fare. I don�۪t expect they were disappointed."

�۝ like its sidling antihero isn�۪t an easy film to like. Or sometimes to watch. Shot in a style that resembles a nostalgic Instagram filter labeled ���seedy-noir �۝ the film�۪s darkly saturated images unsettle more than inform." a vague yet mesmerizing tale of emotional isolation and mental degradation. Expressed in an oblique slow-reveal style the incremental unhinging of Simon (Brady Corbet outstanding) a recently dumped American looking for distraction in Paris occurs with disconcerting ambivalence. Desperately lonely he haunts museums and movie theaters a bland attention-seeking missile who tells more than one young woman that his work involves studying the link between the eye and the brain. That bond is emphasized when Simon resorts ��� in one of the film�۪s few amusing scenes ��� to online pornography and later stops during a sexual encounter to stare at (and sniff and lick) his uncomfortable partner." the director Antonio Campos engineers a pervasive atmosphere of crawling dread. Hostile strangers lurk on rain-streaked streets and Joe Anderson�۪s restlessly wandering camera scans for trouble then abruptly backs off. Sex is explicit and often captured from the waist down underscoring the detachment that Simon seems unable to overcome. And though the film�۪s ice-cold blend of the cerebral and the atavistic can be off-putting it enables a queasy portrait of moral disengagement that lingers long after Simon has slipped from the screen."

�۝ a delicate drama set on the New Jersey coast would be rewarding just for the fine performances from a cast led by James Gandolfini and Famke Janssen. But recent history has given it an extra layer of poignancy that the filmmakers never intended." a shore town that was ravaged last year by Hurricane Sandy. The story about three friends and an outsider who forces their secrets to the surface is heavy with the melancholy of missed opportunity but now merely thinking of this slice of geography brings on a melancholy all its own. The tattered amusement park where ���Down the Shore�۝ is set might have seemed like a clich̩ before the storm but now feels like a metaphor: Change your ways and confront your demons before your whole world is washed away." a given-up-on-life guy who works at the amusement park which is owned by his lifelong friend Wiley (Joe Pope). Wiley married the woman (Ms. Janssen) Bailey wanted. Secrets from their youth bind the three together in a permanent stasis until a stranger (Edoardo Costa) turns up with news about Bailey�۪s sister who had gone to France and not returned. The director Harold Guskin and writer Sandra Jennings show admirable patience in letting the story unspool and the actors reward them." 
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/movies/upstream-color-directed-by-shane-carruth.html
�۝ a deeply sincere elliptical movie about being and nature men and women self and other worms and pigs opens with two scenes: Two teenage boys biking around a leafy suburb and elsewhere a man harvesting little white worms from orchid root balls. The teenagers slowly tracing circles on the pavement are so attractively framed by the soft shimmery light and blurred background that they look as if they could have biked out of a Terrence Malick movie. The teenagers join the man who does nasty things with worms and could be a concerned florist an experimental entomologist a budding serial killer or just a run-of-the-mill science-fiction freak." this botanist (Thiago Martins) can be all things all monsters and metaphors to all viewers. In terms of the story he also is a worm-wrangler cum kidnapper referred to only as Thief who right out of a David Lynch nightmare snatches a blonde Kris (Amy Seimetz) one dark stormy night and pumps worms down her throat. He never explains his actions even after he takes Kris back to her house where a copy of ���Walden�۝ waits for someone to enjoy." Kris becomes a hapless puppet for Thief who murmurs sotto voce instructions (���take a drink�۝) as she writes him checks. By the time he splits her money is gone and her sheets and body are a mess from her trying to hack out her strange slithering invaders." sit tight because for all of Mr. Carruth�۪s cosmic reaching and despite the jigsaw montage ���Upstream Color�۝ isn�۪t an arduous head-scratcher if you don�۪t worry about what it means and just go with the trippy flow. (Mr. Carruth helped cut and shoot the movie and wrote its mood-setting score.) It is instead a sometimes seductive sometimes tiresome m̩lange of ideas that are by turns obvious hermetic touching and sweetly dopey. Much of it involves an emotionally fraught romance that Kris strikes up with Jeff (Mr. Carruth) a relationship that dovetails with a freaky tale of dead pigs blue orchids those mind-altering worms and another mystery man Sampler (Andrew Sensenig) whose mailbox bears the words ���Quinoa Valley.�۝" but if that�۪s an intentional joke Mr. Carruth isn�۪t saying. He�۪s a man of few words and less exposition and ���Upstream Color�۝ doesn�۪t come across as satirical even if it edges close to absurdity. Sampler is similarly taciturn and is mostly seen walking about recording sounds like the papery rustle of dry leaves and the happy gurgle of streams. He also tends to his swine and conducts a shivery creepy deworming procedure with Kris and a pig." he walks among people as undetected as the soulful angels in Wim Wenders�۪s ���Wings of Desire.�۝ In one scene he drifts among his adorable herd of little porkers Christ-like the fingers of one hand trailing through the air as the camera closely follows a shot and a gesture that strongly evoke Mr. Malick�۪s work." however deliberate runs deep. It�۪s evident in Mr. Carruth�۪s emphasis on the natural world; his use of ���Walden�۝; the hushed voices and many images including some time-lapse photography of a dead pig decaying underwater which registers as the catastrophic inverse of the time-lapse sequence of a seed sprouting underground in ���Days of Heaven.�۝ (Mr. Carruth�۪s movie at times feels like days of hell.) Mr. Malick�۪s influence also extends to shots of Kris and Jeff walking whispering and touching that are not moored in a specific time but could be from the past present or future. In these Malick Moments time becomes as circular as the rising and setting of the sun. ���Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in �۝ Thoreau wrote in ���Walden.�۝" skipping through time to create narrative ellipses. He will for instance show Kris and Jeff doing one thing and then ��� as their conversation continues on the audio track ��� cut to images of them doing something else someplace else before looping back to that initial scene. These nominally atemporal lulls feel much like Kris and Jeff�۪s fights about memory (each accuses the other of stealing his or hers) stirringly rooted in life and they serve to anchor a movie that with its natural and unnatural wounds drifts on allegorical currents." ���Upstream Color�۝ offers itself up as a puzzle as well as a philosophical toy that you can spin and spin until the cafe closes and kicks you into the night."

�۝ Danny Boyle�۪s speed-freaky neo-noir begins in a London auction house one of those muted imperial shrines where old masters are bought with nearly imperceptible nods. Starting this way is pretty much akin to a bull locking itself in a china shop. The director of head-rushing entertainments like ���28 Days Later�۝ and ���127 Hours �۝ Mr. Boyle is a flamboyant visual stylist with a punk rocker�۪s delight in anarchic jolts. His is a cinema of attraction and repulsion. One minute he�۪s seducing you with bold color and whooshing cameras the next he�۪s like a kid with a Taser zapping you with grotesque images like a macheted head topped off as cleanly as a coconut." turns and an old-fashioned story that Mr. Boyle has retrofitted with his turbocharged style. It takes a while to grasp just how classic (as in Turner Classic Movies) the material is partly because Mr. Boyle enjoys using devices like actors directly addressing the camera that create a chummy conspiratorial connection between you and his characters. It�۪s a clever strategy and sometimes a nice sleight of hand. When the pretty actor James McAvoy starts talking into the camera in ���Trance �۝ peering at you with his moist sensitive eyes you may find yourself distractedly cozying up to him rather than paying attention to the big picture materializing around him." an auction house employee who has become involved with some bad men led by Franck (Vincent Cassel himself a force of attraction-repulsion). Simon and Franck have gone into business together a pact that produces many many complications including a brazen daytime robbery a purloined Goya a tenacious bout of amnesia and a transfixing hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson) who holds keys to memories and mysteries both. The Goya has gone missing from the auction house but also slipped out of Franck�۪s reach. Simon should know where it is but having been hit hard on the head he�۪s forgotten its whereabouts. That�۪s bad for him and for Franck and his villainous cohort and it should be hard on the movie too." including whirling bodies zipping cameras puzzling flashbacks and seemingly random or potentially resonant images ��� a shot of an art book a pretty brunette a gun in a drawer ��� that you don�۪t have time to linger over the swirl of discrepancies oddities and absurdities. When Elizabeth ushers Simon into her office you may notice the severity of her hairstyle and wonder about her curiously dull-colored clothing which seems purposely designed to camouflage her beauty. (It doesn�۪t work). But mostly you�۪ll be tripping along maybe while giggling at the idea that Simon has gone to Elizabeth so she can help him remember where the Goya is." �۝ Hitchcock�۪s torturous 1945 thriller with Gregory Peck as an amnesiac whose traumatic memories are uncovered with the help of an analyst played by Ingrid Bergman. Hitchcock tapped Salvador Dal�_ to create the movie�۪s surrealistic dream sequences: soundstage hallucinations with enormous floating eyes and some perilously oversize scissors. Mr. Boyle�۪s inventions are more cinematically traditional and largely created with blunt-force editing restless cameras and the bold turns mazing through Joe Ahearne and John Hodge�۪s script. Mr. Ahearne wrote and directed a 2001 British television movie that�۪s the basis for ���Trance �۝ which in turn received a makeover from Mr. Hodge who wrote a few of Mr. Boyle�۪s somewhat harder-edged cheerfully nihilistic (or rather nihilism-flavored) films like ���Shallow Grave.�۝" including his breakout hit ���Trainspotting �۝ about Scottish drug addicts. Neither is it as emotionally affecting as ���Millions �۝ his lovely oft-overlooked film about a motherless boy. Mr. Boyle as always works hard to cast a spell in ���Trance�۝ and his energy and commitment to the audience�۪s entertainment are evident in every scene. But there are times when it feels as if he�۪s throwing everything at the screen ��� the throbbing music bleeding fingers narrative U-turns and the startling sight of a naked Ms. Dawson striding toward the camera as strategically shorn as a Renaissance nude ��� less because he wants to distract you from the big reveal than to obscure the material�۪s thinness." though it drastically shortens the afterglow. For all Mr. Boyle�۪s labors ���Trance�۝ principally comes off as a showcase for his brio a spirit that animates all his choices visual and otherwise. Despite his fondness for ugly shocks deep ones and those more decorative Mr. Boyle is a vulgar optimist. (The seemingly sneery mantra ���choose life�۝ in ���Trainspotting�۝ no longer sounds so hollow.)" like a bolder Botticelli Venus. Mr. Boyle wants to show her off (look at her!) and it�۪s no wonder even if by keeping his male leads inequitably under wraps he�۪s proven he�۪s a real square." severed body parts full-frontal female nudity and partial male nudity."

Billed as a comedy the film written and directed by Alonso Mayo comes to rely too much for its laughs on Luke�۪s unfiltered commentary and his alarmed confusion at the animated and bad behaviors of others (notably a repellent Seth Green as his training supervisor). Still when it works the film serves as a modest reminder that the challenges of autism may sometimes be no more daunting or fearsome than those that face anyone in search of an independent life."

���The Brass Teapot�۝ observes the insidious effects of greed on a young broke couple. When Alice (Juno Temple) and John (Michael Angarano) acquire a teapot that spits out cash every time they hurt themselves they leap into the good life through self-inflicted hard knocks but learn a valuable lesson when other people want their stuff." Alice and John are college-educated na��fs who are going nowhere and are ripe for temptation. (The movie joins a long line of wish-fulfillment comedies: the title even seems to refer to ���The Brass Bottle �۝ the 1964 movie that inspired the TV show ���I Dream of Jeannie.�۝) After a variety of painful antics the ancient magical vessel makes them as rich as the snobby former classmates they used to hate." which is adorned with a Star of David attracts attention from a Chinese scholar who warns against its evils; the couple�۪s ex-jock landlord who catches on; and in an unfortunate subplot two violent Hasidic men who want their family heirloom back. And while John turns squeamish about the cash-for-pain lifestyle Alice still wants it bad." Ramaa Mosley and screenwriter Tim Macy who wrote a short story of the same name have game leads in Ms. Temple (good at crazily curdled innocence) and the menschy Mr. Angarano. But the movie�۪s best bits lose out to the requisite moral turnaround. (When the two compete at delivering hurtful confessions it opens a Pandora�۪s box far more interesting than the bouncy plot.) And the less said of the teapot�۪s World War II origins the better." language and drug use."

But rising nationalism and World War I disrupted the balance and led in September 1922 to a catastrophic purging in which Turkish troops marched in and the city burned.

�۝ Robert Redford�۪s reflective melodrama about political idealism run amok and the wages of youthful folly. For audiences over 50 in particular this fictional story of homegrown terrorists sprung from the 1960s counterculture should conjure complicated feelings of pride shame anger and regret." this earnest well-intentioned movie elicits frustration that its story had to be packaged as a conventional not very suspenseful fugitive thriller with a bogus Hollywood ending. Sidney Lumet�۪s 1988 film ���Running on Empty �۝ which addresses the same subject is much more truthful and compelling." Julie Christie and Susan Sarandon ��� convey an aura of tragic nobility. They portray former members of the Weather Underground which plotted to blow up buildings in United States cities.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/movies/room-237-from-rodney-ascher-takes-on-kubricks-shining.html
���Room 237�۝ is a nonfiction look at some very serious film fans who take ���The Shining �۝ Stanley Kubrick�۪s 1980 masterpiece very very seriously. They know ��� deep in their obsessive sometimes demented cinephile hearts ��� that Kubrick did more than make a feverishly entertaining film about a family falling apart in an isolated hotel called the Overlook. He also embedded amazing messages in ���The Shining �۝ cunningly weaving secrets and signs into the film�۪s very fabric leaving clues about the Holocaust in elevators and messages about the Apollo 11 Moon landing in a sweater. In books blogs and now this movie these fans carry forth the godhead�۪s gnostic communiqu̩s." as in a dazzling aesthetic object a cultural touchstone a showcase for Jack Nicholson a perverse family drama a fiendishly clever horror story a triumph of personal vision and yet another Kubrickian technical tour de force ��� all or none of the above. For contemporary reviewers it was like much of Kubrick�۪s work a divisive object. Some lavished praise on it while others picked up an ax dismissing the film as boring and flaccid comparing it unfavorably to Stephen King�۪s book. For his part Mr. King was so dissatisfied that he adapted his novel into a six-hour mini-series called ���Stephen King�۪s The Shining �۝ leaving no doubt whom he deemed its true auteur." but it exerted an astonishing almost hypnotic pull on moviegoers like Geoffrey Cocks one of the voices that the filmmaker Rodney Ascher has tapped for ���Room 237.�۝ (The title refers to an Overlook room.) Mr. Cocks a history professor at Albion College in Michigan explains that he wasn�۪t impressed when he first saw ���The Shining.�۝ But it snaked under his skin and he wondered if he�۪d missed something. So ���I went back to see it again and I began to see patterns and details that I hadn�۪t noticed before �۝ he says in ���Room 237.�۝ ���I kept watching the film again and again and again.�۝ And what he found gleaning significance from props like a typewriter is ���a deeply laid subtext that takes on the Holocaust.�۝" �۝ though if you visit the Albion College Web site you can peek at his photo and check out his academic bona fides. In broad terms ���Room 237�۝ is a nonfiction movie ��� its human and cinematic subjects are real enough ��� but it�۪s more of a personal essay than a traditional documentary specifically in its truth claims. Its five interviewees are chatty (most are men unsurprising given the film-nerd world) whose voice-overs accompany a stream of visuals. Most of the images have mostly been plucked from ���The Shining �۝ but Mr. Ascher also draws on other Kubrick titles including ���2001: A Space Odyssey�۝ and ���Barry Lyndon �۝ along with an assortment of archival material." whose books include ���The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick History and the Holocaust �۝ proves the most rational of these voices because however tenuously he grounds his interpretation both in history and the visible evidence that is ���The Shining�۝ itself. ���Why a German typewriter �۝ he asks as Mr. Ascher shows the machine in question. An Adler (���eagle�۝ in German) it sits ominously on a desk in the Overlook where each day Jack Torrance (Mr. Nicholson) tries to untap his genius. It�۪s the same one on which he types ��� again and again ��� ���All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy�۝ ��� the refrain that Kubrick with music camera moves framing and a smothering air of dread transforms into a portent of evil." �۝ Mr. Cocks says ���you get the Holocaust.�۝ All right ��� but what does that mean? No one says but like a dutifully literal (or sly) student Mr. Ascher illustrates this part of Mr. Cocks�۪s thesis by cutting from the notorious tsunami of blood in ���The Shining�۝ to a photo of Auschwitz and then back to Kubrick�۪s red wave. ���Because it was in 1942 �۝ Mr. Cocks continues ���that the Nazis made the decision to go ahead and exterminate all the Jews they could. And they did so in a highly mechanical�۝ ��� Mr. Ascher cuts back to the typewriter ��� ���industrial and bureaucratic way.�۝" even if Mr. Cocks presents a case that�۪s reinforced by Kubrick�۪s interest in the Holocaust (it was the subject of one of his unrealized projects ���Aryan Papers�۝) and by the evil throbbing throughout ���The Shining.�۝ The problem is that his reading at least here doesn�۪t resonate as anything but a deeply personal even private interpretation. The four other interviewees in ���Room 237 �۝ including the entertaining Bill Blakemore a correspondent for ABC News advance even less persuasive arguments about Kubrick�۪s film that are tethered at times laughably to what could be just resonant props continuity errors or ��� as with a carpet design ��� tantalizing teasing emblems of Kubrick�۪s oft-repeated interest in puzzles and enigmas." although his comical insertion of Tom Cruise smashing one gloved hand into another in ���Eyes Wide Shut�۝ ��� to represent the interviewees thinking super-hard ��� strongly conveys an amused ironic detachment. Like ���The Shining�۝ and its maze within a maze Mr. Ascher�۪s movie is something of a labyrinth. Puzzling your way through its compilation of vaguely lucid and crackpot ideas is pleasurable though for avid movie lovers it may also feel like a warning. To listen to one other interviewee Juli Kearns talk about an ���impossible window�۝ in the Overlook (���It�۪s like a character in itself it takes over�۝) you are reminded (again!) of Susan Sontag�۪s declaration that ���interpretation is the revenge of the intellect upon art.�۝" paused and re-watched at the touch of a remote. And part of what makes ���Room 237�۝ fascinating to watch and think about (beyond other people�۪s loopiness) is that it shows how works of art become encrusted with their reception. It�۪s a process that has only been accelerated by the Internet where millions of loony and lovely interpretations bloom. The interviewees in ���Room 237�۝ are of course just fans of an especially zealous stripe. Yet in their accumulation of signs clues and messages they are also creating an archive of sorts ��� call it the Kubrick Files ��� that however fanciful or paranoid now exists as an adjunct or even alternative to those of official critical discourse. It�۪s the revenge of the nerds ad infinitum."

And Mr. Plotnick as the petless milquetoast Dolph can have a pleasantly aggrieved sweetness; that he goes to work in spite of having been fired does arouse a spot of feeling." again playing a one-man-band�۪s worth of filmmaking roles obviously has sufficient creative control (seen especially in the video simulating the perspective of waste passing through a dog�۪s digestive tract).

Mr. Ganguly also organizes dance classes which lead to some of the freer and more moving scenes.

�۝ Derek Cianfrance�۪s new movie reveals the scale of its ambitions by slow and patient accretion. The film starts out as the modest tale of a small-time carnival performer ��� a motorcycle stunt rider ��� who turns to crime for misguided but nonetheless semi-admirable reasons and in the early scenes you might mistake it for an earnest locavore indie melodrama." only bigger longer and elevated to a place on the border between grandeur and grandiosity. Set in and around Schenectady N.Y. (whose Mohawk name is evoked in the title) ���The Place Beyond the Pines�۝ has a lot to say about class manhood and the curious operations of fate themes that Mr. Cianfrance articulates with blunt conviction and at times impressive artistry. He goes on too long: the three-part story spread over nearly two and a half hours represents a triumph of sympathetic imagination and a failure of narrative economy. But if in the end the film can�۪t quite sustain its epic vision it does along the way achieve the density and momentum of a good novel." the name on the spine might be Russell Banks or Joyce Carol Oates since like them Mr. Cianfrance is drawn to blue-collar landscapes of the northeastern United States. This Schenectady seen at two different moments 15 years apart feels like a place that time forgot far away from the tumult of politics or commercial popular culture. It�۪s a small town of beat-up houses and late-night diners whose citizens dwell under film-noir shadows of violence and corruption." first glimpsed as a tattoo-covered torso striding away from the camera shows up with his seedy itinerant fairground crew and encounters Romina (Eva Mendes) with whom he had a fling the last time he was in town. When he finds out that his wild oat has sprouted into a baby named Jason Luke decides to stick around insisting that he and Romina and Jason can be a family even though Romina lives with another man (Mahershala Ali). To win her over and support his child Luke with the help of a local mechanic (the excellent Ben Mendelsohn) starts robbing banks speeding away on his motorcycle." a police officer named Avery (Bradley Cooper) who is also the father of a baby boy. The third panel of what Mr. Cianfrance has described as a triptych is about the two sons (grown into Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan). I�۪m reluctant to say more less out of a fear of spoilers than out of respect for the film�۪s structural audacity." ���Blue Valentine �۝ with Mr. Gosling and Michelle Williams was built around a chronological trick. It shuttled back and forth in time between the beginning and the end of the main characters�۪ relationship. The most radical aspect of ���The Place Beyond the Pines�۝ is its relentless linearity the way it tells its story without foreshadowing or flashing back or resorting to other conventional shortcuts. Watching it is refreshing and absorbing partly because it is rare for a film to show this kind of confidence in its own narrative momentum which is also a gesture of faith in the audience�۪s willingness to pay attention." who offer contrasting studies in tragic shortsighted masculine intensity. Mr. Gosling�۪s cool self-possession ��� the only thing he was allowed to display in ���Drive�۝ ��� is complicated made interesting by hints of childlike innocence and vulnerability. In the middle of stickups Luke raises his voice almost to a shriek and his dream of paternal fulfillment is almost pathetically na��ve." the son of a judge (Harris Yulin) is threatened above all by his own righteous arrogance which undermines his relationship with his wife (Rose Byrne) and clouds his professional prospects. Mr. Cooper once again showing himself to be a restless and resourceful talent plays Avery as a handsome charming winner who is nonetheless very difficult to like." and it is in the third-act swirl of revenge and redemption that ���The Place Beyond the Pines�۝ goes wrong trading its grit and psychological insight for overwrought capitalized emotions. As the movie wears on you start to notice Mr. Cianfrance�۪s overreliance on certain shots (like the long behind-the-head follow) and the insistent stabbing squall of Mike Patton�۪s otherwise effective score. (Speaking of music the movie ends with a Bon Iver song that would have been more powerful if it had not been used in a similar way in ���Rust and Bone.�۝)" which makes it easy to forgive even though the disappointment is hard to shake. The movie is a little like both its anguished protagonists going wrong in the name of vanity and love." punishment drugs swearing."

The other is a mysterious magic suitcase that apparently keeps him young while everyone around him ages. The film jumps through 35 years�۪ worth of time with gray hairs and children materializing but no one especially Max really maturing." but it does have a nice circle-of-life ending.

U.S.A. ���The Host�۝ takes place after an alien race the Souls has transformed most of the human population into smiling peaceniks like a nation of hospitality workers. Some humans like Melanie (Saoirse Ronan) and her brother Jamie (Chandler Canterbury) have managed to escape. The story kicks in when Melanie is captured and another alien who for some reason is called a Seeker (Diane Kruger) slices open Melanie�۪s neck and inserts a Soul a luminous white blob with tentacles that look like sperm. Once implanted a Soul is supposed to take over its host�۪s consciousness but Melanie fights her Soul called Wanderer ��� distractingly she talks to it from inside their shared body ��� and together they run off to an Eden-like refuge stocked with supplies and cuties (Max Irons Boyd Holbrook Jake Abel)." derivative and dull ���The Host�۝ is a brazen combination of unoriginal science-fiction themes young-adult pandering and bottom-line calculation. That sounds like it should work (really!) but it never does largely because the story is as drained of energy as are its moony aliens. Ms. Ronan and some special contact lenses spook up the Wanderer (renamed Wanda) but the alien�۪s serenity is a dreary liability. And the split-personality squabbles within Melanie generate no tension even when each character sets sights on a different slab of male prime. The only real fun comes from bushwhacking through the movie�۪s thicket of influences and commercial imperatives and marveling at its weird combination of ���Twilight�۝-like chaste romance Cronenberg-lite body horror and Heinlein-esque puppet mastery." but Ms. Ronan keeps on trucking. With her clear steady gaze and a physical bearing and gestural style that feel highly disciplined she has always come across as preternaturally mature. There�۪s an almost otherworldly aspect to her screen presence partly due to her stillness and her own translucent eyes which can suggest grave intensity or utter detachment. She may turn into another Cate Blanchett." though Ms. Ronan who turns 19 next month just has to prove that she is smoothly transitioning to adulthood and ready for the corresponding roles which for a young woman in American movies means she has to demonstrate sex appeal and kiss some guys.

Max Lewinsky (James McAvoy) who from the looks of his clenched jaw and zooming car is very angry very determined and terminally alone.

But when tragedy upends their respective paths and Rashid befriends an older French photographer (Sa��d Taghmaoui) his sudden awareness of alternatives to his intellectually and emotionally arid life will prove more destructive than the violence that made it possible." David Raedeker�۪s cunning photography bathes everything in a rich golden light that aggressively beautifies the cement-and-convenience-store landscape. Nuances of faith politics and sexual identity enrich what initially presents as a classic good son-bad son tale and although the film�۪s melting-pot patois is occasionally too dense to decipher we get the gist.

the time of Marc Evans�۪s high school musical ���Hunky Dory.�۝ This sun-bleached candy-colored movie is set in southern Wales where Vivienne Mae (Minnie Driver) a passionate feisty drama teacher mobilizes her apathetic students to stage a rock opera based on Shakespeare�۪s ���Tempest�۝ in the final weeks of the school year. The score will consist of existing rock songs." which spills all over the place evokes ���High School Musical �۝ ���Glee�۝ and ���Billy Elliot.�۝ But unlike them it feels less like a corporate product than like an earnest eccentric expression of its creators�۪ nostalgia for the twilight of a musical lotus land before the Sex Pistols and the Clash changed everything. The closest thing to a rock god is David Bowie whose ���Life on Mars?�۝ stands as the unofficial theme song of ���The Tempest.�۝" Miss Valentine (Haydn Gwynne) condescendingly informs her students that she is ���middle class �۝ and that they are ���working class.�۝ Predictably the loutish physical education teacher Mr. Cafferty (Steve Speirs) is also contemptuous of artistic expression. But Vivienne has an ally in the school�۪s headmaster (Bob Pugh) who bravely assumes the role of Prospero after a student drops out." disorganized potpourri of rehearsals and student melodramas anchored in Ms. Driver�۪s spunky performance. Davy (Aneurin Barnard) the handsome dreamy-eyed student who plays Ferdinand is in love with Stella (Danielle Branch) the production�۪s Miranda who won�۪t give him the time of day. Davy is so bereft he briefly transfers his yearnings to Vivienne who deftly deals with his crush." the blond curly-haired boy who portrays Ariel is questioning his sexuality and discreetly pines after Davy. The show�۪s Caliban Kenny (Darren Evans) is a skinhead with a strong voice who can�۪t take his classmates�۪ teasing and drops out." and their tone unabashedly romantic. Ferdinand and Miranda�۪s love song ���Don�۪t Talk �۝ by the Beach Boys has rarely sounded better. One of Ariel�۪s numbers conjuring magic is Nick Drake�۪s haunting ���Cello Song �۝ beautifully crooned by Mr. Harries. Caliban�۪s ballad of alienation is David Crosby�۪s brooding ���Everybody�۪s Been Burned.�۝ The Electric Light Orchestra�۪s ���Strange Magic �۝ ���One Summer Dream�۝ and ���Livin�۪ Thing�۝ are also heard and relate effectively to the Shakespeare play." including a fire that nearly burns down the school the elaborate production is finally staged outdoors. What little we see of it is charming." softhearted pop fantasy mean to today�۪s young audience? Will any of its songs be remotely familiar to moviegoers born after 1980? Pop memories are short.

The pair need $500 to finance this venture and in the course of a long hot day they zigzag across New York trying to raise the money by stealing selling weed and other devious dubious means." but its spirit is closer to the bouncy mischief of earlier 1980s hip-hop. Though Malcolm and Sofia ��� especially Sofia ��� like to talk tough and strike thuggish poses there is something sweet about their eagerness to prove themselves. ���Bombing�۝ the apple they believe will make them legends in the graffiti world and beyond and Mr. Leon both respects their dream and views it as a romantic almost childlike fantasy." race and class in the city. And ���Gimme the Loot�۝ has a lot to say about the contradictions of a place that is defined by both abundant opportunity and ferocious inequality." street-smart vernacular treating its protagonists not as embodiments of a social condition but rather as self-aware individuals who are like teenagers everywhere both smart and dumb. Their friendship ��� which is based above all on shared artistic ambitions ��� is a perfect comic pairing. Sofia is intense and unsmiling while Malcolm is a charming goofy chatterbox and they make a vivid impression even without spray paint."

�۝ Paul Weitz�۪s new comedy is either clever or cruel ��� perhaps both. In the next few weeks word will go forth from colleges across the land about who is in and who is out as the American higher-education-industrial complex enacts its own Darwinian version of ���Project Runway.�۝ As the father of a high school junior paying my tithe to the test prep gods while preparing to sacrifice most of my worldly goods on the altar of the liberal arts I can�۪t tell if I�۪m part of the intended audience or if the ratings board should issue a special warning for sensitive parents like me. How could anyone make light of the brutal capricious system by which our young people are judged and sorted?" �۝ which had the potential to be a sharp satirical jab at the soft belly of middle-class anxiety chose instead to be a warm and wacky fable of wish fulfillment. Mr. Weitz lines up a target placed at the explosive intersection of class race region and every other source of societal anguish and then does not so much miss as aim in another direction ��� or several ��� letting fly a volley of darts that land as lightly as badminton birdies." precise jokes and observations at the expense of pushy parents vain professors and compulsively striving youngsters. And there is Tina Fey who captures the frustration of the modern professional woman almost as perfectly as Jack Lemmon channeled the strivings and failures of company men in an earlier era." an admissions officer at Princeton who takes a certain sadistic pleasure in controlling the fates of aspiring undergraduates. But the application process is not the only arena of competition in her life. Portia and her office rival Corinne (Gloria Reuben) are vying to succeed the soon-to-retire dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn) while the university itself is fighting to reclaim its place at the top of the U.S. News & World Report rankings. Meanwhile Portia is defeated on the romantic battlefield losing her unbearably smug English-professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen looking like a tweedy housebroken werewolf) to an aggressive and fertile Virginia Woolf scholar (Sonya Walger)." perhaps of its ambivalence about feminism. It turns out that ���Admission �۝ adapted by Karen Croner from a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz is less concerned with college than with the familiar endlessly controversial predicament of women who dare to have both careers and children." using a trusty conceit ��� the long-lost child of uncertain parentage ��� that proved useful to Shakespeare and the Romans. When Portia was an undergraduate (at Dartmouth) she had a baby that she gave up for adoption. Seventeen years later on a recruiting visit to a granola academy somewhere in the Northeastern woods she meets a talented confused boy named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) who she becomes convinced is her son." a teacher at the school and a fellow Dartmouth alum who has the good fortune of being played by Paul Rudd. Mr. Rudd is as usual a genial and disarming presence smart but not too smart cute but not too cute and not bothering to do too much of anything that might look like acting. He does not try to compete with Ms. Fey as she bounces from furious hauteur to dizzy desperation but instead nimbly returns her volleys of comic energy." though not as much fun as they might have been in a riskier crazier movie. The best scenes belong to Lily Tomlin brilliantly cast as Portia�۪s mother an unbowed second-wave woman warrior with a pair of borzois and a Bella Abzug tattoo. In the history of American comedy Ms. Tomlin sort of is Ms. Fey�۪s mother and the on-screen ambivalence of the relationship gestures toward Ms. Fey�۪s complicated relationship with her precursors. (This theme was memorably explored in an episode of ���30 Rock�۝ featuring Carrie Fisher as a pioneering television writer who turns out to be a bitter boozy wreck.)" with and without the collaboration of his brother Chris has a mellow off-speed approach to screwball situations. What is disarming and sometimes frustrating about ���Admission�۝ is its niceness an acceptance of the way things are that splits the difference between tolerance and complacency. Late in the game the dean warns Portia that if some of the liberties she has taken in admitting Princeton�۪s new class were ever to come to light ���the whole system would fall apart.�۝" �۝ she says and though the film notes her sarcasm it also essentially affirms her acceptance of the status quo. Mr. Weitz tends to regard potentially infuriating aspects of contemporary American society with more of a raised eyebrow than a clenched fist. ���In Good Company �۝ his 2004 glance at predatory business practices and ���American Dreamz �۝ his 2006 musical mockery of Bush-era politics and reality television are both notable for their niceness and ���Admission�۝ is similarly nonconfrontational." as if it could not quite figure out what kind of movie it wanted to be. ���Just be yourself!�۝ Portia would say. And then she would put it on the waiting list." tame swearing and shocking SAT scores."

Shadowy international connections are referred to. At a certain point the entire operation considers abruptly relocating to Dubai." lawless no man�۪s land that looks as forbidding today as it did in the 19th century." �۝ you may worry that the cargo in any innocent-looking white van streaking down a highway may not be furniture and home appliances but a group of chained sex slaves being taken from one hell to another in a sadistic warlord�۪s fiendish underground network.

���The Call�۝ is a model of low-budget filmmaking. Well as low as anything starring Halle Berry goes. It�۪s probable that Ms. Berry was the priciest item in the budget followed by the movie�۪s one other conspicuous expenditure a sprawling 911 dispatch center called the hive. Buzzing with the trills of incoming calls and the hum of reassuring voices the hive is where every rote greeting ��� ���911 what is your emergency?�۝ ��� becomes the opening line in a never-ending procession of melodramas comedies dramas tragedies and horror stories like the one that puts the chill in this no-frills diversion." what is your emergency?�۝ is ���once upon a time�۝ with higher or at least more shudderingly plausible stakes. That�۪s the clean clever premise of ���The Call �۝ which along with being a movie about a woman in trouble helping other women (and a few men) in trouble is something of a salute to your tax dollars at work. Like Steven Soderbergh�۪s epidemiological nightmare ���Contagion �۝ in which a miscellany of federal agencies saves humanity the heroes in ���The Call �۝ including Jordan (a fine Ms. Berry) are largely Los Angeles government workers ��� beat cops fingerprint technicians and call-center operators of all races and ethnicities ��� who are presumably collecting a livable wage and benefits. Given how many extra miles Jordan runs crawls and scrambles she earns her overtime." soon after the movie opens Jordan calamitously fumbles a phone plea for help. Years later in movie time she remains haunted by that bad call and now trains new dispatchers and pops prescription pills. But as John Wayne says in ���Rio Bravo ���sorry don�۪t get it done�۝ ��� nor does it win the audience�۪s sympathy and hold its attention. Which is why after an inexperienced operator starts bungling a distress call from a kidnapped teenager Casey (Abigail Breslin at once grown up and believably adolescent) Jordan climbs back in the saddle. Jaw and shoulders squared she puts on her headset stares purposely ahead and as rescue plans go into overdrive starts smooth-talking Casey down from convulsive hysteria to panic." and is calling from inside the trunk of a moving car. It�۪s a harrowing situation for her and a potentially tricky one for filmmakers as is apparent from how dissimilar directors handle characters trapped in rooms coffins airplanes and the claustrophobia-inducing like. Here the director Brad Anderson working from Richard D�۪Ovidio�۪s script tucks you inside a car trunk with Casey using close-ups that turn her face into a vista and tears into rivers. And then just when you�۪ve grown accustomed to that face have started worrying about it he cuts to Jordan who ��� with the call center often blurred behind her as if the world and its certainties were disappearing ��� is in a very different tight place." Paul (Morris Chestnut) and a troubled past but mostly she has intelligence integrity a sense of grave purpose and righteousness. She�۪s an old-fashioned hero in many respects so it�۪s fitting that Mr. Anderson uses old-fashioned filmmaking techniques like crosscutting to build tension and old-school exploitation tricks like evil to justify taking the story dark and then dark and bonkers. He slithers under your skin easily. Yet even as he ably demonstrates his gift for making meaning visually say by playing interiors against exteriors he never showboats at Casey and Jordan�۪s expense. His focus remains on these two who like a lot of women know how to talk their way out of anything." disturbing wigs and the usual crude language."

The first image of what looks like a beach party keeps the happy vibe going. Dozens hundreds of gyrating dancing young women and men are basking in the honeyed light ��� as the beat goes on and the smiles sour into sneers ��� though it becomes evident that they�۪re also marinating in a tsunami of beer." it floods: over heads writhing torsos and the bared breasts that wiggle like puppies and wag at the camera like the middle fingers that more and more revelers raise. Welcome to the party dude Mr. Korine seems to be saying (or is he snickering?) now sit back relax and enjoy the show. He proves an excellent ringmaster and a crafty one too. In ���Spring Breakers�۝ he bores into a contested deeply American topic ��� the pursuit of happiness taken to nihilistic extremes ��� but turns his exploration into such a gonzo outrageously funny party that it takes a while to appreciate that this is more of a horror film than a comedy." well that�۪s part of the queasy transfixing experience that is ���Spring Breakers �۝ which plays with some of the same ideas in Mr. Korine�۪s last feature ���Trash Humpers.�۝ In that movie shot on VHS tape four characters in rubber masks run amok getting down and dirty as they compulsively even ritualistically grind their pelvises against anything ��� garbage of course included ��� in a creepy joyless yet also amusing burlesque. In ���Spring Breakers�۝ Mr. Korine has traded in his plug-uglies for a far more seductive and commercially viable female quartet that includes two former Disney teen queens Selena Gomez (as Faith) and Vanessa Hudgens (Candy) along with Ashley Benson (Brit) and his wife Rachel Korine (Cotty)." the four play students at a nondescript school somewhere warm that�۪s ornamented with palm trees and bored young people smoking weed hanging out sometimes reading and even attending classes. Over a number of dreamy elliptical scenes that slide from day to night and back it emerges that the four friends want to go on spring break but don�۪t have enough cash. While Faith prays on her problems ��� ���Are you crazy for Jesus?�۝ her church leader calls out ��� the other three opt for a more direct approach: armed with squirt guns and a lady-sized sledgehammer they go full-on gangsta and rob a restaurant. ���Pretend it�۪s a video game �۝ one giggles. ���Act like it�۪s a movie.�۝ So they do." but first: paaarty! The four later take off for spring break in St. Petersburg Fla. There they join an invading army that has seemingly commandeered every inch of sand surf and hotel. From rooms and halls these tanned groomed white-teethed paragons of American youth and orthodontics spill onto balconies and into pools laughing and yelling as they drink snort dance grind thrash and jump jump jump up moving together like a single pulsing organism. They�۪re beautiful and monstrous enthralling and repellent. For those who don�۪t belong to their tribe (never wanted to never did) they may be exotic worrisome frightening or representatives of the decline of the West in hot-pink bikinis." a pasticheur and cultural vulgarian (part Dada part European art cinema part MTV�۪s ���Jackass�۝) isn�۪t interested in making up your mind for you. Instead he tosses out his ideas like puzzle pieces and lets you see how or if they fit. The women want to go on spring break and want to have fun and he seems to want the same. He splashes on the gorgeous gaudy color and bends the story line adding brief flash-forwards and flashbacks that make it seem as if time were incessantly skipping forward and backward almost swirling. Gestures bits of dialogue and moody moments are repeated like old songs like dreams rituals and highlight reels." and the actresses seem happy to do things that would make Uncle Walt spin in his grave. They�۪re almost giddy at least at first and given that both Ms. Gomez and Ms. Hudgens have put in time working for Disney it�۪s no wonder that they cut loose. In ���Spring Breakers�۝ they have the chance to simulate the behavior that feeds the tabloids without the humiliations and career-crushing price paid by the likes of Lindsay Lohan. For his recent putatively adult role in ���The Paperboy�۝ Zac Efron (Ms. Hudgens�۪s co-star in Disney�۪s ���High School Musical�۝ series) played a scene in which Nicole Kidman urinated on him. The female stars of ���Spring Breakers�۝ get to shoot guns and hang out with James Franco." wearing grillz and long cornrows rolls up with guns and a white Camaro convertible with red rims. His character a rapper from ���St. Pete�۝ called Alien is a hustler dealer and self-anointed gangsta. He walks the bad-boy walk and talks the talk but he�۪s strictly thug lite a white caricature in a cartoonish masquerade of black masculinity. For the women he becomes something of a sleazy Prince Charming ��� not all the princesses are equally charmed ��� in a story that has metamorphosed into a feverish fairy tale. ���Look at all my�۝ stuff he boasts almost self-amazed in a startling deliriously funny riff on ���The Great Gatsby�۝ ��� except that instead of throwing shirts in the air he�۪s brandishing machine guns bricks of dope wads of cash animal-print shorts." war and African-Americans. One of them draws a heart and the words ���I want penis�۝ on some paper. They laugh and as the professor keeps talking one pantomimes giving oral sex. It doesn�۪t matter that they�۪re not paying attention to their history lesson. Because at that point they haven�۪t yet pretended to be gangstas and robbed the restaurant giggling as they held a squirt gun to a black man�۪s head ��� playing thugs without the burden without the history without the cost." the women�۪s movements and violence are seen inside a frame as if you were watching a film within a film. The whole episode looks preposterous like a bad music video and the women in their black ski masks just seem silly. Much later when Mr. Korine loops back to the crime he takes you inside so you can see the terrified customers cowering as Brit and Candy smash up the place waving their ���weapons.�۝ The squirt guns are fakes but both the women�۪s pleasure and the rage that pumps through the scene and increasingly through the film ��� feeding the excesses the posturing and escalating violence like a poisoned river ��� feel eerily real familiar and very American." ���Spring Breakers�۝ looks different depending on how you hold it up to the light. From one angle it comes across as a savage social commentary that skitters from one idea to another ��� white faces black masks celebrity the American dream the limits of self-interest the search for an authentic self ��� without stitching those ideas together. From another it comes off as the apotheosis of the excesses it so spectacularly displays. That Mr. Korine appears to be having it both (or many) ways may seem like a cop-out but only if you believe that the role of the artist is to be a didact or a scold. Mr. Korine on the other hand embraces the role of court jester the fool whose transgressive laughter carries corrosive truth. He laughs you howl."

When everyone gathers to watch the show they glow in its reflected light." therefore we are (and act). This seems partly why Luciano (Aniello Arena) after auditioning at a local mall becomes increasingly preoccupied ��� and then obsessed ��� with joining the program. The audition awakens something deep inside him something that goes beyond a simple desire to perform or delight in attention and that speaks to his very being.

There is something nonetheless at stake even without the blood that seeps through ���Gomorrah.�۝" kitsch seems the rule as with the prancing white horses that when the movie opens are being tracked from on high in an aerial shot while they pull an ornate gold carriage. If not for the car tailing it and the occasional human speck in modern clothes the carriage could be something that Marie Antoinette would have ridden into Paris. As the carriage rolls through the streets the camera slowly descends moving closer and closer like a bird coming in for a landing.

but that good will has bred laziness in film and television. Put a troubled veteran or two into your script and you tap everything the public already knows and feels relieving you of the responsibility of having any fresh insights into veterans�۪ issues or creating an involving story." �۝ a first feature by Mischa Webley jumps on this bandwagon with an unconvincing sometimes unfathomable tale about a brooding veteran (Chadwick Boseman) who was involved in a vaguely defined atrocity while fighting overseas. Now back home he is being pressured by a shadowy organization to hunt down a newly discovered witness to that atrocity (played by Tory Kittles)." which in more capable hands might have made a decent one-act play."

Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) Burt is the leader of a tacky swashbuckling magic act that is about to hit the skids after 10 years at the top. Through their spangled jumpsuits sprayed coifs and preening choreography they suggest the Siegfried and Roy of illusionists. But after years of going through the motions they have let their act become stale and passionless." self-styled stud whose groupies are obliged to sign release forms and show proof of age before he agrees to have sex with them in what he claims is the largest bed in Las Vegas. Because Mr. Carell doesn�۪t go in for the kind of all-out caricature that Mr. Ferrell embraces with a manic glee ���The Incredible Burt Wonderstone�۝ has an underlying soulfulness that cuts against its farcical aspirations. This is not to say that Mr. Carell isn�۪t just fine only that his performance as impressive as it is lacks a shark�۪s bite." Burt and Anton rule the strip until Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) an arrogant guerrilla street magician challenges their supremacy. Mr. Carrey a remarkably buff 51 imbues Steve with a take-no-prisoners ferocity that he hasn�۪t demonstrated in years. He steals every scene in which he appears with his scary-funny depiction of the entertainer as sociopath who would as soon murder you as make you laugh." ���The Incredible Burt Wonderstone �۝ directed by Don Scardino from a screenplay by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley is an agreeable if squishy fable about the magic of magic and the need to rediscover the true believer within. Once Burt and Anton�۪s partnership ends in a career-destroying professional mishap Burt has to grow young again in order to grow up. It is not an original message nor is it conveyed with any special conviction." when he was a lonely nerd who was bullied at school and found salvation in an instructional video in prestidigitation featuring the legendary magician Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin). Rance who has retired in Las Vegas suddenly appears late in the film to remind Burt of the inspiration behind his true calling. At the time he meets Rance Burt has lost everything and has been reduced to doing magic tricks at a show-business retirement home." too much of which concerns Burt�۪s possible romance with a former stage assistant (Olivia Wilde) he emotionally abused. Ms. Wilde brings as much charm as she can to a perfunctory underwritten role that makes little psychological sense.

Standard fish-out-of-water tale made for life lessons a few high jinks and funny stuff right?" Tom Gustafson and the writer Cory Krueckeberg take their story seriously and the respectful early scenes set in a static washed-out Kansas have an appropriately slow awkwardness that they let drift into flatness and tedium.

The air around them is charged with anxiety ��� about the threat of nuclear war mostly ��� intellectual restlessness and sexual curiosity. Perhaps it always is that way for 17-year-olds but every generation acts out its own particular pageant of rage revolt and disillusionment." whose father abandoned his family when she was small is wilder and sadder than Ginger (Elle Fanning) whose flame-red hair stands out amid the ambient browns and grays that signify the pre-swinging as-yet-un-Beatled England. On some of their adventures ��� smoking cigarettes making out with boys hitchhiking to the seashore ��� Ginger seems to be following her friend hungry for Rosa�۪s company as much as for the thrill of illicit experience." for reasons that are perhaps too neatly accounted for is a risk taker who does poorly in school and regards her mother (Jodhi May) with undisguised contempt. Ginger in contrast is rebellious in ways that show her to be responsible and disciplined rather than impetuous. She writes poetry and goes to Ban the Bomb meetings and rallies and seeks out the approval and the company of at least some adults. She is delighted when her cleverness and commitment are noticed by her gay godfathers both named Mark (Timothy Spall and Oliver Platt) and by their friend Bella (Annette Bening) an American writer of uncompromising seriousness." though Ginger worships her father Roland (Alessandro Nivola) who seems after his own scruffy intellectual fashion as dashing and romantic a figure as his literary namesake. ���You�۪re a born radical �۝ he tells his daughter which pleases her even though he means it primarily as self-praise. In his own account at least Roland a writer and teacher who was imprisoned as a conscientious objector during the war has devoted his life to fighting tyranny and flouting convention. Eventually he invokes these principles to justify an almost unimaginably appalling ��� but also in its way perfectly ordinary ��� betrayal." like ���Yes �۝ with its rhymed dialogue and geopolitical gestures or the gender- and history-defying ���Orlando.�۝ Her impeccable sense of color and composition and her use of montage and careful sound design as a kind of emotional shorthand are used here in the service of novelistic psychological realism." but also the general atmosphere of British left-wing bohemianism. Some of it may be a bit too perfect and programmatic and the film�۪s adult characters sometimes seem more like types than people. (This is especially true of Natalie Ginger�۪s unfulfilled disapproving mother played by Christina Hendricks who struggles nobly to find nuances in the role and to get a handle on her accent.)" since part of the narcissism of adolescence is a tendency to view grown-ups as caricatures and supporting players in one�۪s own drama. Ginger smart as she is is blind to both Roland�۪s flaws and Natalie�۪s virtues and the film is in part the story of her eyes being brutally opened to the truth about her parents. But it is also true to its title the chronicle of her relationship with Rosa." forcing unspoken emotions to erupt in furious scenes that should be more devastatingly believable than they are. But nearly everything else here has the ring of truth in no small part because of the two remarkable young actresses in its title roles." who is younger than her character shows a nearly Streepian mixture of poise intensity and technical precision.

nostalgic look at Japan in 1963 from the perspective of a schoolgirl who lives in the Yokohama neighborhood evoked in the title. Though it was written and ���planned�۝ by Hayao Miyazaki perhaps the greatest living fantasist in world cinema (and directed by his son Goro) this movie based on a manga by Chizuru Takahashi and Tetsuro Sayama is a lovely example of the strong realist tendency in Japanese animation. Its visual magic lies in painterly compositions of foliage clouds architecture and water and its emotional impact comes from the way everyday life is washed in the colors of memory." a ship captain was lost at sea during the Korean War and her mother is studying in the United States leaving Umi to help her grandmother look after two younger children and a house full of eccentric boarders. The lonely girl is a staple of the Miyazaki universe and Umi�۪s melancholy thoughtful manner suffuses the atmosphere of ���From Up on Poppy Hill.�۝" though. Two entwined stories emerge from the routines of home and school. One involves the effort to save the Latin Quarter a dilapidated mansion where Umi�۪s male classmates convene to conduct scientific experiments expound on philosophical matters and indulge in other forms of endearing dweebery. After enlisting (along with her best friend) in the campaign to stop its demolition Umi develops a crush on its least nerdy member Shun (Anton Yelchin) though their family histories are connected in ways that complicate the romance." but the shadow of war hangs over their lives much as it did in ���My Neighbor Totoro �۝ Hayao Miyazaki�۪s magnificent fable set in the 1950s. The specific tragedy that lies in the background may not register with children which means they will be touched by the film�۪s sadness without being too upset by it. Adults meanwhile are likely to be charmed by the love story and enchanted by the delicate rendering of a bygone but not entirely forgotten era."

�۝ from Perry Henzell in 1972. Set in the same decade when Kingston exploded in politically fueled gang warfare Storm Saulter�۪s ���Better Mus�۪ Come�۝ attempts a righteous plunge into this treacherous period with cut-rate pulp style and turf melodrama. But despite its cultural detail and fetching leads this Jamaican director�۪s colorful debut feature is undone by ragged scene construction weak acting and a scattered script." a poetic single dad Ricky (Sheldon Shepherd) becomes drawn into partisan fighting involving the ruling People�۪s National Party and the Jamaica Labor Party. His rapid romance with Kemala (Nicole Grey) becomes just one more thing threatened by the violent tit for tat. Not even a Rastafarian spiritual ceremony can overcome the stubbornly pervasive ill will which culminates in a scene inspired by the Green Bay Massacre of 1978 in which soldiers killed several suspected gang members." rarely far from corrugated-metal walls and getaway alleys this subtitled film is proudly rooted in its homegrown dramas. Mr. Saulter pulls off some nifty visual shorthand as in the opening scene�۪s prelude to an attack on an election rally and he doesn�۪t soft-pedal the blood sweat or tears of these feuds. The choice of material becomes a casualty of filmmaking that could have been tighter and cleaner."

The best way to celebrate a writer of course is to read his work but that solitary pursuit which replicates and requites the writer�۪s own lonely labor lacks a sense of occasion. So you might go to the movies instead." while not all terrible lack the crucial inimitable fact of his voice) I can point you in the direction of Film Forum where William Karel and Livia Manera�۪s new documentary ���Philip Roth: Unmasked �۝ is being shown ��� free thanks to the beneficence of the Ostrovsky Family Fund ��� for the next week." and like most of the other entries in the series it is respectful serious absorbing and exactly 90 minutes long. A handful of creditable writers ��� the novelists Nicole Krauss and Jonathan Franzen the critic and journalist Claudia Roth Pierpont ��� offer their thoughts on Mr. Roth and some of their observations are insightful. Friends of long standing (Mia Farrow Martin Garbus and Jane Brown Maas who has known Mr. Roth since his undergraduate days at Bucknell) speak fondly of him and carefully refrain from betraying any confidences." given that his great subject has always been himself it is Mr. Roth who dominates the screen. Mr. Karel and Ms. Manera spent 10 days in his company in New York and at his house in western Connecticut and succeeded in putting him at ease. He is for 90 minutes marvelous company ��� expansive funny generous and candid." �۝ but of course those parts technically belonged to Alexander Portnoy Neil Klugman (of ���Goodbye Columbus�۝) Nathan Zuckerman and other alter egos. Mr. Roth calls them ���stand-ins�۝; the literary term is personae which is Latin for masks. So the writer is ���unmasked�۝ in the movie in the sense that he rather than any of his characters ��� including the one called in the memoirs ���Patrimony�۝ and ���The Facts �۝ as well as in fiction like ���Operation Shylock�۝ and ���The Plot Against America �۝ Philip Roth ��� is the person we see." for the most part kept that way. Passing mention is made of a ���brutal lurid�۝ first marriage but those interested in Mr. Roth�۪s relationships with women will have to await Blake Bailey�۪s authorized biography or else succumb to the irresponsible irresistible vice of treating novels as source material." Keith Gessen ��� is mostly sidestepped here and perhaps implicitly defused by the eloquence and enthusiasm of Ms. Farrow Ms. Krauss and Ms. Pierpont." notably the tribal uproar that greeted Mr. Roth�۪s first stories when they were published in magazines and then in ���Goodbye Columbus�۝ in the late 1950s. Then and again with the publication of ���Portnoy�۪s Complaint �۝ he was arraigned as an anti-Semite and a self-hating Jew charges he did not so much refute as transcend turning the drama into grist for subsequent imaginative flights." a French filmmaker and Ms. Manera an Italian journalist have the advantages of standing outside the scrum of American literary politics and also of coming from countries that have venerated their writers with statues standard editions postage stamps and occasional prison time. We do not see their faces or hear their questions but it is clear that they paid their subject the courtesy of being interested in and familiar with his work and that he repaid them by reflecting on its sources and meanings." an excavation of roots followed by a chronicle of labor. We learn that Mr. Roth composes standing up and that he sends finished manuscripts around to a few friends whose reactions he then tape records and transcribes as part of the revising process. This practice shows remarkable openness and self-confidence and it suggests something very different from the neurosis and narcissism so often ascribed to writers who draw from the reservoir of the self." he has also painted vast and intricate canvases of everything else. ���Philip Roth: Unmasked�۝ is especially strong when it reaches what might be thought of as his major phase the extraordinary period that began with ���The Counterlife�۝ (1986) and that includes ���Sabbath�۪s Theater�۝ and ���American Pastoral �۝ surely two of the finest novels of the past quarter-century." in the end is the sum of the masks he has devoted his life to making."

���I Killed My Mother �۝ is both a twist on a Freudian joke and a complicated assessment of the hero�۪s over-cathected relationship with his parent in chief. ���Deep down I love her �۝ the 16-year-old Hubert Minel (Mr. Dolan) says in one of the movie�۪s confessional black-and-white interludes ���but it�۪s not the love of a son.�۝" Hubert but it is the love of a son though as Mr. Dolan shows it can look a lot like romance with all its messy ���I hate you I love you I hate you�۪s.�۝ And Hubert who resembles a pouty young Elvis a pouf of dark hair artfully flopping over one eye often expresses it with a wounded howl throwing tantrums and lashing out at his mother Chantale (a wonderful Anne Dorval) picking at her taste in clothes her table manners her very self." �۝ a 2009 hit at Cannes now getting a United States release were all raw emotion it would be a drag. But Mr. Dolan a Qu̩b̩cois filmmaker who was just 20 when he directed this movie and 16 when he wrote the script is less an Angry Young Man than a playful talented one. He�۪s altogether more in control than Hubert his semi-autobiographical alter ego." and knows enough not to burlesque it (or to burlesque it only gently). Better yet he has compassion for Chantale a single mother with a difficult son. When they sit side by side bickering in the car ��� about the radio about what other moms do and how other sons behave ��� Mr. Dolan captures something specific about these two people and also something more universal about the rope-a-dope dance between sullen adolescent and parent. (Ms. Dorval�۪s Chantale often wears a mask of opaqueness which seems almost calculated to set Hubert off yet she still manages to convey weariness indulgence and worry.)" oh yes Hubert is gay which is what he can�۪t tell Chantale. He has a boyfriend Antonin (Fran̤ois Arnaud) who has a much cooler mother: She takes the boys�۪ relationship in stride; has her own studly boyfriend who parades around half-naked; and even taps Hubert and Antonin to do drip paintings on her office walls �� la Jackson Pollock. (Chantale whom Mr. Dolan gives the last name Lemming has no idea who Pollock was. Antonin and his mom meanwhile have been graced with the last name of Rimbaud.)" Mr. Dolan has a freewheeling style and he�۪s self-dramatizing enough to want to call attention to it without being too much of a visual show-off. He likes extreme compositions ��� pushing characters to the side of the frame or to the bottom ��� and he makes use of slow motion (and fast motion) and those black-and-white sequences of Hubert confiding to a video camera as if it were a diary (a diary whose moody visuals might seem a bit Gap ad-ish in another context). His second movie the swoony charmer ���Heartbeats �۝ takes style even more seriously both in its allusive execution ��� he draws giddily from things like the Nouvelle Vague and Wong Kar-wai ��� and its subject: self-fashioning and teasing unfulfilled desire." ���I Killed My Mother�۝ is no ���Psycho.�۝ The matricide here (spoiler?) is at one point wishful ��� Hubert tells a sympathetic teacher that his mother�۪s dead ��� but mostly metaphorical. Like a good Freudian boy Hubert must ���kill�۝ his parent to grow up though here it�۪s poor old Mom not dear old Dad. On the evidence of this film Mr. Dolan the artist seems to have grown up quite nicely."

perhaps dismayingly so. At certain stops the bus or subway car will suddenly be flooded with adolescents releasing their pent-up energies in a confined space. Their loudness their rudeness the lack of consideration they display as they flirt fight tease and shout can be overwhelming and can cause even tolerant old-timers to think grouchy thoughts. What�۪s the matter with kids these days?" and probably nothing new. Directed by Michel Gondry and starring a boisterous cast of real New York teenagers recruited from the Point a community center in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx ���The We and the I�۝ neither scolds nor sentimentalizes its young characters. Instead the film invites viewers of whatever age to immerse themselves in the chaos glee and heartache of a long ride home on the last day of school." the BX66 ��� is both literal and symbolic. Even in bad traffic it would probably not take until nightfall to get from one part of the borough to another in the long days of June but the changing light reflects the mood of some of the students as their high spirits are shadowed by loneliness hurt feelings and the possibility of grief. To call this thrillingly original deeply felt movie a coming-of-age story would be to insult it with clich̩. It�۪s much more the story or rather a series of interlocking incomplete stories about what it feels like to be a certain age and to feel caught as the title suggests between the desire to be yourself and the longing to fit in." romances kindle and flame out secrets are revealed and copious trash is talked. From time to time the cacophony gives way to vintage hip-hop beats (from Young MC Slick Rick and others) that are older than most of the cast. There are occasional forays outside the bus ��� mostly flashbacks and fantasy sequences ��� but for the most part the camera nimbly navigates its teeming claustrophobic interior. We hang out with the bullies in the back eavesdrop on plans for a sweet-16 party and visit with the driver (Mia Lobo) who might prefer a different route." and they register some of the shock that audience members might feel at the cruelty bad language and freewheeling obnoxiousness of the younger passengers. The filmmakers and the actors are committed to showing without apology or judgment just how badly these kids can behave and then inviting us to like them anyway. Some moments of harassment and humiliation are hard to watch including the smashing of one boy�۪s guitar and the ridiculing of a girl for her hair looks and sexual history but they are also entirely believable." the kids are constantly texting and passing around a short video of one of their schoolmates executing an inadvertent pratfall on a kitchen floor greased with butter. That clip repeated over and over starts to feel like a 10-second distillation of the movie�۪s themes and attitudes. It is hilarious mortifying hazardous and random and the tumbling boy Elijah (Elijah Canada) who is not on the bus is at once a celebrity and a scapegoat mercilessly mocked by the friends who nonetheless love him." and in the sweetness that peeks out from beneath the bravado and sarcasm. It has such a generous curiosity about life and such a commitment to the group�۪s dynamics that singling out a few characters seems a little unfair. But our attention keeps circling back to Michael (Michael Brodie) and Teresa (Teresa Lynn) whose complicated history of affection disappointment and pain is both the truest thing in the movie and the closest it comes to conventional teen-movie romanticism." and while ���The We and the I�۝ does not display the wizardry of his ���Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind�۝ (or for that matter ���The Green Hornet�۝) it is full of his signature blend of whimsy inventiveness and Gallic boho-humanism. It is also like the great ���Dave Chappelle�۪s Block Party �۝ a valentine to New York as too few travelers (or for that matter residents) see it: crowded loud and rough but with room for everyone. And if you listen closely you�۪ll hear the poetry in the noise."

At its heart are two orphan girls ��� one dark one fair ��� whose destinies are entwined even as their paths in life have diverged. One of them has fallen under a malign and powerful spell or maybe both of them have." restless and adrift seems plagued by the kind of mental distress that used to be ascribed to demonic influence. To her friend Voichita (Cosmina Stratan) she is no longer herself. Voichita meanwhile has taken up residence in a convent under the sway of a priest who resembles in Alina�۪s eyes a malign and charismatic sorcerer. Each young woman wants to rescue the other. Alina wants Voichita to throw off her habit and run away with her to Germany which passes for a land of enchantment among those who live at the poor margins of the European Union. But Voichita takes her vows seriously and wishes her friend could share the comforts of work prayer and spiritual discipline." but the intense longing of both women for a situation in which their love for each other might thrive gives this film its suspense and its devastating power. There is no question that they are trapped but the source of their inability to free themselves is as elusive as freedom itself." absorbed in the routines of monastic life and the emotional currents that ripple underneath its surface and occasionally spill out into the open. The rhythms of the film and the rough intimacy of the camera work allow you to experience both the calm order that Voichita finds soothing and the unbearable confinement that Alina experiences. In other words even as Mr. Mungiu maintains a detached objective point of view allowing the details of the story to speak for themselves he also allows you to glimpse the complex and volatile inner lives of his characters." ���Beyond the Hills�۝ might have easily have succumbed to sensationalism or scolding flattering the sophistication of an audience accustomed to regarding religion with contempt or condescension. But while Mr. Mungiu inspired by the Romanian journalist Tatiana Niculescu Bran�۪s books about the incident (which took place in a Moldavian convent in 2005) hardly casts spiritual authority in a flattering light he also refuses to derive easy or comforting lessons." played with tormented haggard patience by Valeriu Andriuta is a flawed leader whose decisions have appalling consequences but he is less villainous than tragic a man motivated by real compassion as well as a desire to prove his own goodness. He is not so much corrupted by power as overwhelmed by responsibility and weighed down by the loneliness of his role. Not that the film excuses his actions. But the answer to the question ���How did this happen?�۝ ��� and for those not familiar with the real-world back story I will refrain from saying just what ���this�۝ is ��� is not simply that a cruel and superstitious priest went crazy." Romanian society or something more abstract like the modern world or human nature. But all of these forces are implicated in a precise rigorous drama that is also an earnest attempt at social criticism and philosophical inquiry. Like this director�۪s breakthrough film ���4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days �۝ which was set in the last years of the Ceausescu dictatorship ���Beyond the Hills�۝ depicts a world that seems to have been organized to undermine solidarity and stigmatize decency. And like the earlier movie it explores this terrifying moral landscape by examining the fragile friendship of two young women who are neither innocent victims nor fearless heroines." 3 Weeks and 2 Days�۝ had the clarity ��� and to some degree the comfort ��� of hindsight. Viewers could be soothed by the knowledge unavailable to the characters that the nightmare of Communism would soon be over. ���Beyond the Hills �۝ unfolding in a place that seems both post-Communist and pre-modern is in many ways a more troubled and ambiguous film. It investigates a mystery that grows deeper the more clearly it is seen."

Some of the characterizations seem a bit too on the nose: the retired policeman (Burghart Klaussner) still obsessed with the earlier crime; the calm disciplined killer (Ulrich Thomsen) and his weak-willed sidekick; the detective (Sebastian Blomberg) half-crazed with grief over the recent death of his wife." �۝ along with some others notably Katrin Sass (in the role of the first girl�۪s mother) and Roeland Wiesnekker (as the second victim�۪s father). These actors are partly responsible for the current flourishing of German-language cinema ��� their recent credits include ���Goodbye Lenin�۝; ���The White Ribbon�۝; ���The Baader Meinhof Complex�۝; and ���Soul Kitchen�۝ ��� and Mr. Odar gives them plenty of room to work.

�۝ an adaptation of a notorious 1796 Gothic novel when the shadows all but swallow the actor Vincent Cassel�۪s face. It�۪s an appropriately foreboding image for a heavily plotted tale of demons and men God and the Devil that in his influential review of the novel Coleridge excoriated for combining ���all that is most awfully true in religion with all that is most ridiculously absurd in superstition.�۝ He conceded that the book had ���much real merit�۝ but also ���impiety �۝ ���abominations�۝ and ���libidinous minuteness.�۝" who wrote it when he was 19 and briefly serving as an attach̩ to the British Embassy at The Hague. The Marquis de Sade talked ���The Monk�۝ up and Andr̩ Breton was also an admirer ��� no wonder given what befalls its title character. In the movie the tale begins with a stormy once-upon-a-time flourish and a foundling left at an abbey door on a desolate dark night. The child grows up to be a sternly devout monk Ambrosio (Mr. Cassel) whose legendary piety attracts followers both innocent and not and leads to a spectacular downfall that explains Coleridge�۪s blistering condemnation." and what repulsed Coleridge in the novel clearly amuses the French director Dominik Moll in his diverting if somewhat thin adaptation. Set in Spain and written by Mr. Moll with help from Anne-Louise Trividic this French-language version starts down its increasingly twisted path when a young nun Sister Agn̬s (Roxane Duran) accidentally drops a message from her lover after making her confession to Ambrosio for confession. He reports her to the mother superior (Geraldine Chaplin) who after discovering Agn̬s is pregnant throws the poor girl in the dungeon where she understandably damns Ambrosio. While Agn̬s rots Ambrosio meets his increasingly complicated sometimes confusing fate partly in the form of a beauty named Antonia (Jos̩phine Japy)." whose films include ���With a Friend Like Harry... �۝ somewhat heroically manages to keep the story�۪s manifold twists from becoming knotted but he�۪s less adept at setting up the characters and their relationships and especially the depth and significance of their faith. He likes to play in the dark but while he drapes the movie in menace and shadow little ever feels at stake no matter how attractively Mr. Cassel�۪s eyes widen. That�۪s true even when a mysterious masked figure Valerio (D̩borah Fran̤ois) appears at the abbey and the mood grows progressively more threatening phantasmagoric and a touch kinky. There�۪s never any doubt that Mr. Moll believes in the Devil if only as a narrative device but without a commensurate sense of the holy there�۪s nothing to fear."

�۝ a dispiriting infuriating jumble of big money small ideas and ugly visuals the answer seems to be no ��� unless perhaps the man behind the curtain is Martin Scorsese or James Cameron. The Walt Disney Company is the studio lurking behind ���Oz �۝ and as usual it is banking that it can leverage this 3-D prehistory of the Wizard of Oz (James Franco) for its wonderful world of cross-promotional marketing and ancillary revenue streams. With so much riding on this ���Oz�۝ it�۪s a surprise that the results are so uninspired ��� or given Disney�۪s recent run with the likes of ���Alice in Wonderland �۝ maybe not." though is that the studio that has enchanted generations with Tinker Bell and at least a few plucky princesses has backed a movie that has such backward ideas about female characters that it makes the 1939 ���Wizard of Oz�۝ look like a suffragist classic. Which it was in its charming way: L. Frank Baum who wrote the 1900 book ���The Wonderful Wizard of Oz�۝ and its 13 follow-ups was the son-in-law of the pioneering feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage and her influence permeates the Oz books which take flight with a brave girl who saves her friends and their land. Baum�۪s second book ���The Marvelous Land of Oz �۝ even features a parodic take on the suffrage movement with a female general Jinjur leading an all-girl army equipped with knitting needles." fellow-citizens and girls �۝ Jinjur declares ���we are about to begin our great Revolt against the men of Oz!�۝ Too bad they didn�۪t storm Disney next." maybe they could have jabbed some sense into the director Sam Raimi best known for the first ���Spider-Man�۝ movies and his five male producers and then used those needles to shred Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire�۪s script. A little sisterly outrage would have been appropriate because among other offenses the filmmakers have thrown over Dorothy ��� one of the greatest heroines in children�۪s literature and Hollywood cinema ��� for a prequel about a two-bit magician and Lothario with female troubles. In Baum�۪s first book and in the 1939 film the witches are powerful forces for good and wickedness in the Land of Oz. In ���Oz the Great and Powerful �۝ a witch not only falls for the man Oz she also turns green from envy when he cozies up to a pretty blonde. (Yeah the baddie is a brunette.)" partly because Mr. Raimi opens by paying tribute to the 1939 film ��� with black-and-white visuals and a square screen ��� when he introduces the young wizard Oscar Diggs or Oz. Fast talking and promisingly shady Oz works in a dusty Kansas circus hustling rubes with doves and peddling sweet nothings to the ladies. One miss Annie (Michelle Williams) stands out but ��� in a worrisome sign ��� he can�۪t commit. When another woman�۪s lover chases him Oz hops in a hot-air balloon and after riding out a storm arrives in a garishly hued digitally rendered land that brings to mind the (bad) cover of a prog rock album and announces that while we aren�۪t in Kansas anymore neither are we in movie dreamland." across a crowded room and in a galaxy far far away. It�۪s where dreams come true and it�۪s nowhere to be found in ���Oz the Great and Powerful.�۝ Instead there is a little romance some adventure too much jokey patter a rainbow coalition of Munchkins and enough digital wizardry effectively to make this an animated movie. Even the troika of witches ��� Theodora (Mila Kunis) Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Ms. Williams) ��� look as if they have received some unnecessary digital facial smoothing. They�۪re as eerily gleaming and artificial looking as the movie�۪s most visually arresting character a porcelain doll China Girl (voiced by Joey King) whom Oz rescues with kindness and glue." Finley an unfunny flying monkey (voiced by Zach Braff) rapidly wear out their welcome with the kind of grating Billy Crystal-light patter that gurgles through a lot of children�۪s movies. Although he brings some tangible real feeling to the scene of Oz mending China Girl Mr. Franco looks pretty pained in most of his scenes with them and it�۪s hard to blame him. Whether embarrassed by the material or just uneasy performing in such a computer-generated atmosphere he never finds a way to make the wizard pop. (He is it should be said feverishly in his element joy riding over a different rainbow in ���Spring Breakers �۝ which opens soon.)" but he�۪s usually better with actors than he is here. It�۪s startling how much difficulty he has energizing a shot of two people talking in a room though as one digital landscape follows another it�۪s also easy to imagine that much of his energy was sucked up by the movie�۪s technical challenges. The same felt true as the ���Spider-Man�۝ franchise dragged on and it�۪s also true of Ang Lee�۪s work with the actors in the scenes that bookend ���The Life of Pi �۝ a superior work to this one in every way. What both movies share however are directors stumbling as they try to do what cinema has wondrously done from its start ��� represent human life." specifically her dream of escape and her own imagination into a beautiful metaphor for movies. When Dorothy opens her front door onto a Technicolor wonderland the moment evokes what a 1930s moviegoer might have experienced when watching a color film for the first time. Come into this magical place the filmmakers and by extension Hollywood itself seemed to be telling the audience and share in this dream ��� a dream called Oz that we also call the movies." though often the biggest-budgeted releases are war movies in superhero drag or cartoons about characters whose adventures much like that of Oz in this telling track like therapeutic journeys (follow your dream of self-actualization) instead of transcendent excursions (just dream!). Loaded with special effects big bangs and generic narrative beats these movies nonetheless sometimes take you where you�۪ve never been before. Mostly though like ���Oz the Great and Powerful �۝ these fantasies drag you back to the same dreary heavily trod destination to the same exhausted formulas gender stereotypes general idiocy and a mind-set that values special effects over storytelling. Yes companies make movies for shareholders; they have for decades. But who is the audience for the numbly mistitled ���Oz the Great and Powerful�۝?" sweet and true little girl�۝ who journeys into another world whose existence its witches and wonders was partly inspired by a real liberation struggle. The 1939 film turned Dorothy�۪s adventure into a dream and tacked on a lesson (���there�۪s no place like home�۝). Yet crucial to its enduring power is that in the shadow of the Great Depression Dorothy�۪s dreams and imagination (and a clunk on the head) are what transport her. For all their flights of fancy the book and the 1939 film remain tethered to reality and to characters who because they are a lot like life allow you to step into their silver shoes and ruby slippers. In these Oz stories the magic is transcendently human."

In Ms. Danticat�۪s Haiti story a stubborn grade schooler keeps going to class after the 2010 earthquake without paying the tuition; in Cairo a rape victim�۪s account to the police is artfully transmuted by her superhero fantasy rendered in animated segments. A raft of actresses (Meryl Streep Kerry Washington Selena Gomez and more) supply in-your-head narration in tones that are intimate and defiant but not pitying." bonded servitude and plain old patriarchal vetoing ���Girl Rising �۝ directed by Richard E.

He also possesses a down-to-earth directness that cuts through elaborate protocol and Japanese manners." he violates the ground rules shakes Hirohito�۪s hand looks him straight in the eye and insists that they stand side by side in the picture to be taken. Hirohito doesn�۪t seem offended." filtered through the perspective of MacArthur�۪s right-hand man Gen. Bonner Fellers (Matthew Fox of ���Lost�۝). Fellers is charged with determining whether Hirohito regarded as a god by his people should be prosecuted for war crimes. Specifically was Hirohito an avowed pacifist pressured by militants to approve the bombing of Pearl Harbor? MacArthur demands clear-cut evidence. Fellers given a strict time limit must infiltrate the emperor�۪s inner circle to find out." MacArthur has his eyes on the American presidency and a strong political faction in the United States wants Hirohito�۪s execution whether or not he approved the Pearl Harbor order. Fellers warns MacArthur that the Japanese even in their vanquished state will rise up if the emperor is executed." a Japanese teacher he met when she was an exchange student in the United States but who is now missing. It plays out ��� often in intrusive flashbacks ��� as a hollow time-wasting convention shoehorned into the story to explain Fellers�۪s sensitivity to Japanese culture." Fellers and Aya have little to say to each other. Pained looks of thwarted desire tears and desperate clinches do not a character or a relationship make." and throws in a weak subplot having to do with a rival general�۪s report that Fellers might have arranged for American bombers to avoid targeting the area where she lives. Mr. Fox�۪s stiff poker-faced performance though not incongruous with his role as MacArthur�۪s dutiful underling doesn�۪t change when he is out of his boss�۪s sight." by David Klass and Vera Blasi has the tone and structure of a well-organized if elementary essay in cultural relativism. Fellers is told not to confuse the modern appearance of Japan with its ancient traditions that guide social behavior and in which loyalty and obedience count for more than anything." however is not to be seen in this movie. Except for the Imperial Palace and Army headquarters everything is rubble. There is a brief mention of the fire bombing of Tokyo on March 9 1945 in which an estimated 100 000 civilians were incinerated and we see a distant view of the city in flames. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are barely mentioned." well-mannered exercise.

Yet while Colin Farrell and his sensitive hardworking eyebrows help keep it from becoming a full-bore lampoon the gangland clich̩s nutty plot and seemingly random casting choices (F.

the modest lovely American independent movie ���Pavilion�۝ opens with a group of teenagers setting off fireworks at dusk. They�۪re boys mostly dressed in oversize shirts and baseball caps and standing a few feet from one another as young men tend to do in groups. It�۪s a spatial arrangement that announces their independence even as everything else ��� clothes gestures and camera movements ��� unites them. Given the sizzle and fiery sparks the bright green smudged across the image and the thick summery feeling enveloping it all this could be the Fourth of July or just another day in that paradise soon lost called youth." suburbia or a small town. You have to guess because the director Tim Sutton doesn�۪t share much at least not overtly and the kids aren�۪t especially chatty. Their names and other scene-setting information emerge piecemeal usually in disjointed conversations that sound as if they were caught on the fly. There�۪s no inciting incident or barbed narrative hook and it�۪s unclear if this is a fictional work or a documentary. Unguided by obvious story signposts you slip from image to image pulled along by their beauty (the digital cinematography is by Chris Dapkins) and by the dreamy leisurely rhythms of the editing (by Seth Bomse)." partly because as filmmakers like Gus Van Sant know there is something irresistible and transfixing about young bodies in motion. The influence of Mr. Van Sant�۪s more experimental films ��� their framing elliptical storytelling and tenderness ��� on ���Pavilion�۝ is as apparent as the ubiquitous sway of Terrence Malick. As with some of Mr. Van Sant�۪s movies the title here is enigmatic though its meaning is suggested by a sequence of one of the boys Max (Max Schaffner) wandering through some thick woods with a girl. In long shot the two seem very small and the woods very big and while the teenagers look as if they could be swallowed up by this place it also gives them shelter." who�۪s seen shooting off fireworks and hanging out with another boy ��� biking watching TV playing with toy guns ��� emerges as something of a protagonist or at least a focal point. Later you learn he�۪s been living in upstate New York with his mother (maybe on summer break) but at about a half-hour into ���Pavilion�۝ he moves to Arizona to live with his father." who�۪s almost as much of a question mark as Charlie Brown�۪s. What Max thinks of his father and what his father thinks of him remains unsaid. Max just tags along riding shotgun in his dad�۪s minivan and trailing after him like a puppy when he applies to move into an apartment complex." but Mr. Sutton doesn�۪t milk the moment. Instead he continues to follow Max with the same observational dispassion and visual lyricism then abruptly shifts focus to one of the locals (Cody Hamric) whom Max has befriended." reserved watchful lot (about the only time anyone uses an outdoor voice is at a boozy party) ��� Mr. Sutton tends toward quiet.

�۝ a thoughtful and adventurous new feature directed by Keith Miller is about the different worlds that exist in a modern city and even within a single human being. The first scene depicts an uncomfortable encounter fraught with overt and implicit racial and class implications involving two men and a dog. That moment frames the story that follows and re-enacts the real-life meeting between Mr. Miller and Shannon Harper who plays the main character also named Shannon." a nonprofessional actor plays a version of himself with shrewd diffidence leaving many of Shannon�۪s emotions and motives half-buried in slow gestures and enigmatic expressions. The point is not that Shannon is especially mysterious but rather that he�۪s ordinarily and uniquely complicated." Shannon works as a claims adjuster at an insurance company migrating sometimes gracefully sometimes awkwardly between the office and the street. Mr. Miller follows him through routines that are disrupted by a bit of very bad medical news and observes how his daily life continues in the shadow of death." attentive to how black and white Brooklynites share and contest public space and to the different selves Shannon assumes with friends co-workers strangers and his mother (Mary Meyers). But it is at least equally concerned with the metaphysical dimensions of his experience and with the haunting philosophical question of how a mortal individual can understand his place in the universe." Mr. Miller explores this issue in modest prosaic terms. His film shows the influence of other recent work in the American neo-neo-realist vein notably Ramin Bahrani�۪s ���Goodbye Solo�۝ and Lance Hammer�۪s ���Ballast �۝ and like them relies on understatement and indirection to arrive at a powerful and resonant meaning."

As Jack Regan the leader of an elite London police unit whose tactics emulate those of the thugs it pursues Mr. Winstone chews on this Cockney cops-and-robbers caper with foulmouthed glee." then sleeping with the wife of an Internal Affairs operative is probably not your best move. This dangerous dalliance is only one of Regan�۪s reckless decisions tolerated by his uptight boss (Damian Lewis) because he gets the job done. Even so like the gritty 1970s television show that spawned the movie Regan is a dinosaur.

Simon Dennis�۪s photography is glossy and crisp and a lengthy foot chase ��� making excellent use of the National Gallery ��� is inventively choreographed. And if the villains are little more than fireplugs in balaclavas the violence they provoke is satisfyingly vicious. Be warned however: With slang featuring more prominently than Regan�۪s well-fed belly this is a film that makes no concessions to foreign ears." baseball bats and battered suspects."

This story of a struggling Los Angeles actor and dissolute single dad (Mr. Webber) trying to face responsibilities and raise a 2-year-old (Isaac Love Mr. Webber�۪s real-life toddler) is a reminder." dotted with Hollywood semi-deities (played by among others Aubrey Plaza and Michael Cera nicely tarnishing his affable-nerd persona) is a tableau of youthful bloodless affluence." as is Sven Pape�۪s fluid editing.

this movie is being sold as a psychological thriller but could be filed under This Old Haunted House if the shivers were palpable rather than implied. Good haunted-house movies should fill you with a sense of looming dread about homes and their nightmares as in Edgar Allan Poe�۪s landmark story ���The Fall of the House of Usher.�۝ By contrast ���The Condemned�۝ is uncanny only in its resemblance to a television soap with acting as flat as the lighting and scenes that end with the kind of cliffhanger moments that otherwise announce commercial breaks." though you may hopefully think you�۪re watching an art-film pastiche along the witty avant-garde lines of something by the Chilean director Ra̼l Ruiz. Unfortunately Roberto Bus�_-Garc�_a the director of ���The Condemned �۝ offers no proof that he�۪s playing with genre. Instead working from a script he wrote with Danielle Schleif and Luis R. Trelles Mr. Bus�_-Garc�_a teases out the thin story oh so slowly getting things going with men and women bustling about a large gloomy house. Eventually personalities emerge along with a story: Ana (Cristina Rodlo) has traveled to Puerto Rico from Mexico carting both her invalid American father Dr. Puttnam (Axel Anderson) and archival material from his former medical practice." though it�۪s unclear how it was sullied or why. For far too long it�۪s also puzzling why the neighboring town a decentered heap of undifferentiated shacks with peeling paint and low illumination seems populated only by shuffling old people who appear to be abusing their meds. Mr. Bus�_-Garc�_a does some nice work when he first hits town notably with a shock of violence that shifts the mood from mildly unsettled to modestly threatening. But either he isn�۪t interested in building on that jolt to create some narrative tension or doesn�۪t know how to and so as with the other mysterioso moments that he stirs up the surprise quickly dissipates. By the time he finally throws his biggest bombshell the movie is hopelessly adrift." an American pathologist and cancer researcher who some suspect conducted ghastly experiments on patients while working in Puerto Rico in the 1930s. Dr. Rhoads�۪s real crime may have been writing a letter while drunk in which he disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed to have experimented on patients and killed eight. He later insisted that he had been joking and was cleared after an investigation but the letter prompted the American Association for Cancer Research to remove his name from one of its awards. Whatever the truth there are the makings of a good story here if one that remains out of view in ���The Condemned.�۝"

His ���vengeance�۝ trilogy ��� in particular the middle chapter ���Oldboy �۝ currently being remade by Spike Lee ��� is cherished by many cinephiles in South Korea and beyond for its blend of visual elegance melodrama and extreme violence." unquestionably his craft. We find ourselves in a world of lurid saturated colors; languorous camera movements; temporal displacements; and jagged shards of sound: an atmosphere that replicates the inner experience of India Stoker a Connecticut teenager who manifests the funereal demeanor of Wednesday Addams and the seething intensity of a poem by Sylvia Plath." played by Mia Wasikowska is an introspective solitary teenager who on her 18th birthday loses her father (Dermot Mulroney in flashbacks) to a car accident. She mopes around the lawns and hallways of her family�۪s enormous estate seething at her mother Eve (Nicole Kidman) who seems to India insufficiently grief-stricken. The girl�۪s mood grows darker with the arrival of Charlie (Matthew Goode) a handsome uncle she never knew she had." and there is something literary about the watchful musically gifted India. The territory staked out in ���Stoker�۝ ��� a landscape of family secrets sexual subtext and aristocratic entitlement ��� is at times reminiscent of a Henry James tale. The patterns and symbols that pop up around India may be signs of a sinister external presence or they may be figments of her own feverish imagination." longing curiosity and rage ��� dominates the film�۪s atmosphere though not everything is happening in her own head. The family�۪s housekeeper (Phyllis Somerville) disappears and a visit from a concerned relative (Jacki Weaver) signals further danger ahead. Charlie seems to be seducing Eve which disgusts India even as her suspicions about her uncle are complicated by other feelings and his apparent interest in serving as her protector." perhaps from India and certainly from us and Mr. Park with sadistic relish takes his time with revelations that are both ghastly and a bit disappointing. The exquisite sense of mystery that has built up around India begins to dissipate as the focus shifts to Charlie and tantalizing ambiguities are resolved into a tale of madness and murder." though the final act of ���Stoker�۝ walks a fine line between the sensational and the silly. Mr. Park is less interested in narrative suspense than in carefully orchestrated shocks and camouflaged motives. Learning the truth about Charlie does not so much explain what had come before as turn everything upside down scattering the puzzle pieces in a colorful brutal cascade." �۝ the violence in ���Stoker�۝ is relatively restrained though its cruelty is extreme. But the ugliness that is uncovered in the Stoker family history is finally less haunting and less interesting than India herself. Ms. Wasikowska has a remarkable ability to use the watchful stillness of her features to hint at the girl�۪s emotional turmoil; her eyebrows widening in alarm or contracting in fury may be the film�۪s most potent effect. She faces appalling and occasionally preposterous circumstances with a mixture of innocence and skeptical intelligence that is close to heroic. That goes for the actress as well as the character she plays." violence madness."

striking a balance between the old (and often sexist) and the new (and vaguely progressive) is trickier than it might seem. The makers of ���Snow White and the Huntsman�۝ tried to reconcile two potentially irreconcilable ideas ��� a thoroughly modern miss and an old-fashioned happily ever after ��� by putting a sword in Snow White�۪s hands so she could ride alongside her heroic hunk. The results weren�۪t half bad even if this butched-up Snow White didn�۪t magically transform into a genuinely liberated princess." �۝ by contrast have generally opted to stick to the original boy meets beans boy loses beans boy meets giants and so on embellishing the familiar bedtime story with 3-D and other effects noisy battles and an occasional wink at the material. Partly what distinguishes this Jack from earlier farm boys who logged adventures with big men and legumes is that he�۪s played by Nicholas Hoult yet another one of those anodyne young British actors ��� along with the seemingly nice likes of Andrew Garfield and Eddie Redmayne ��� whose sensitive eyes and droopiness make them unthreatening romantic playthings. This Jack lives with his hectoring uncle (Christopher Fairbank) instead of his mother and tries to sell the family�۪s horse rather than its cow." though and suggests that this old tale has been refurbished with more than the usual digital bells and whistles is that he has a promising doppelg�_nger in Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson).

Jack and Isabelle meet cute when he tries to scare off ruffians who hassle her while she�۪s watching a theatrical performance about giants. Jack�۪s bravery foreshadows greater deeds much as the onstage battle between giants and men augurs a deadlier offstage fight. Isabelle�۪s pluck is similarly suggestive but alas this isn�۪t ���Jack and Jill Giant Slayers.�۝" twisting thing that rises out of the earth to pierce the clouds like a god�۪s monstrous multi-plaited spear. At the other end waiting in an otherworld called Gantua is a race of male giants a cannibalistic brotherhood led by General Fallon (Bill Nighy). Nicely realized through a combination of digital wizardry and motion-capture performances the giants are best in show from their plug-ugly heads to their leathery ulcerated toes. The director Bryan Singer clearly enjoys playing with these oversize puppetlike meanies and finds queasy comedy in their threat especially when Jack Isabelle and some others including a knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor channeling Errol Flynn) nearly become finger food." ���Jack the Giant Slayer�۝ is painlessly diverting. The visual design for the giants and the beanstalks keeps your eyes busy even when the story sets your mind to wandering. If it drifts with increasing frequency it�۪s because well this finally is just a digitally souped-up one-dimensional take on ���Jack and the Beanstalk �۝ capped by the kind of interminable blowout that makes many big-studio entertainments feel as long as the last Oscars.

�۝ Pablo Larra�_n�۪s sly smart fictionalized tale about the art of the sell during a fraught period in Chilean history advertising isn�۪t only an art; it�۪s also a way of life. That�۪s certainly true for the young adman Rene Saavedra (Gael Garc�_a Bernal) who skateboards through the movie pausing now and again to care for his son or dash off another ad campaign. When approached to help create one to oust Gen. Augusto Pinochet he signs on. Rene may be vaguely interested in selling the country on life without Pinochet but what reels him in is the challenge of pitching a superior product." when jackets were unstructured and political repression was the cruel rule of law in Chile. That year a constitutionally mandated national referendum was held to determine if Pinochet would remain in power. Voters who supported the regime were to vote yes; those who didn�۪t were to vote no. It�۪s unclear if the plebiscite matters to Rene. Unlike his estranged wife Veronica (Antonia Zegers) a hard-eyed activist he doesn�۪t register as especially political. When an opposition leader Urrutia (Luis Gnecco) approaches Rene about working for the No campaign he�۪s interested but noncommittal. Only when his boss Guzman (the great Alfredo Castro) asks if he was ���offered the No�۪s campaign�۝ ��� a funny ���Mad Men�۝ moment ��� does Rene seem to commit." �۝ a play by Antonio Sk��rmeta the Chilean novelist and a former exile the movie tracks Rene as he wrangles the idealists coordinating the campaign brainstorms with admen colleagues and with them creates the advertisements ��� each side has 15 minutes a day for a month to make its case on TV ��� to persuade Chileans to vote no. For the political idealists the campaign promises an end to tyranny and a democratic future. For Rene at least initially the No vote with the freedom it promises is just another consumer product one that during the campaign he will transform from a want into a need with rainbows white-faced mimes dancing girls smiling children a basket of baguettes and a catchy jingle: ���Chile happiness is coming!�۝" as some Chilean critics have complained more complicated than the movie depicts a revelation that will shock only those who mistake storytellers like Mr. Larra�_n for documentarians. Mr. Larra�_n�۪s attention to period detail is of course a familiar filmmaking strategy that gives the movie a patina of verisimilitude as does his liberal sampling from the original often hilarious No ads. More unusually however he also shot the movie using a couple of rebuilt vintage Sony U-Matic video cameras. This gives it a blurred muddy off-putting look at least when the movie is projected because blowing up video images amplifies visual artifacts including eye-gouging distortions like visible scan lines and color that looks as if it�۪s on the verge of separating." �۝ in which the black-and-white images and absence of spoken dialogue are meant to mimic the filmmaking era. One difference is that while ���The Artist�۝ seeks to seduce you with a nostalgic simulation the anti-aesthetic of ���No�۝ is initially so distracting that it can bring you out of the movie. As time goes on and the story deepens ��� and your interest does too ��� you grow so accustomed to the visuals that you largely stop noticing them or at least being bothered by them. In other words you become used to the ugliness." at times comically self-regarding and the movie weren�۪t so playful about his limitations his lack of passion about the country�۪s future would come off as appallingly cynical. As it is Rene is one of those compromised characters whose obvious virtues run a tight race with his flaws. In one early scene he doesn�۪t just stand by when Veronica is beaten by cops; he also recoils from the violence. It�۪s unclear if Rene is a garden-variety coward afraid of physical harm or whether his fear is a manifestation of a deeper moral stain. The casting of the appealing Mr. Garc�_a Bernal suggests that Mr. Larra�_n has rigged the game but what he�۪s done is create a recognizably real sometimes uncomfortably imperfect character instead of a politically correct prop." he�۪s neither a man of the right nor the left. His father is an anti-Pinochet activist but Rene is himself a capitalist tool and apparently a happy one. As an advertising whiz he embodies a consumer society in which everything ��� democracy freedom the self ��� is for sale. Rene helps the No activists wage war against one type of dictatorship but an argument can be made that he represents another kind of tyranny one in which freedom is reduced to freedom of consumer choice." he prefaces his pitch with the promise that the TV commercial he�۪s prepared for their soda communicates that ���today Chile thinks in its future.�۝ The soda spot is absurd (mimes synths and frenzied joy) but Rene is a master marketer and he uses the same line about Chile�۪s future with the No activists ��� noble deeply serious men and women whose own campaign commercial is a near-parody of miserablist art. ���This doesn�۪t sell �۝ Rene announces a casually tossed off remark that becomes part of a running meta-argument about political art. And then he pulls out rainbows and smiles and the movie takes off like a shot." oppression language."

Their encounter is awkward and a little pathetic but also courteous and sweet and Mr. Kiarostami plays with our implicit assumptions about what kind of a story this might be. The old man Takashi (Tadashi Okuno) seems motivated more by loneliness than by lust and in Akiko�۪s eyes he may serve as a surrogate for her doting grandmother who leaves worried messages on her voice mail." oblique qualities of lyric poetry and impart a beguiling sense of strangeness to ordinary even banal situations." traveling outside his home country ��� to Italy for ���Certified Copy �۝ and now to Japan ��� and working with non-Iranian actors.

Akiko is adrift in transit in a vulnerable state of in-betweenness without a fixed identity. Her improvised ephemeral connection with Takashi turns into one corner of a triangle that is completed when her boyfriend Noriaki (Ryo Kase) shows up accosting Akiko on her way to an exam as Takashi watches through the windshield.

Are they strangers? Lovers? Husband and wife? We are not quite sure." �۝ by contrast the motives and actions of the characters are relatively clear to us but decidedly ambiguous to them. Akiko Takashi and Noriaki are more or less what they seem: a confused young woman; a kind lonely old man; a guy with serious anger-management issues." by Mr. Kiarostami�۪s standards fairly straightforward even conventional: it has a teasing start an expository middle and a startlingly (though not unpredictably) dramatic end. And yet every shot ��� everything you see and everything you don�۪t ��� imparts a disturbing and thrilling sense of discovery."

Ethan even sleeps interestingly and when the movie opens he�۪s writhing and dreaming of a mysterious figure whose long streaming locks suggest a Freudian interpretive progression (hair pubic hair and the non-PG-13 like) and that takes a turn for the safe when his possible dream girl Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) abruptly materializes." which means it�۪s kind of like Romeo and Juliet but like you know happier. Ethan finds himself immediately drawn to Lena when she slinks into school with downcast eyes a moody mouth and tangle of long dark hair which is understandable considering the zombie-Barbies at school with their mean girl talk and marmalade tans. These are girls as Barbara Bush would say who rhyme with witch. Lena on the other hand is an actual weird sister though she�۪s understandably reluctant to share this news. It�۪s complicated after all what with a curse some lore and spooky relations among them Uncle Macon (Jeremy Irons)." or rather Mr. Irons helps bring the movie to another level by deepening its emotional colors and widening its pleasures. He brings wit timing and actual acting to the mix as does Viola Davis who plays Amma Ethan�۪s nanny and a loosey-goosey and funny Emma Thompson who goes both light and dark to play separate characters and seems to be having a blast. Ms. Englert and Mr. Ehrenreich are naturally appealing but when Mr. LaGravenese wants to push the story so that it feels as if something is truly at stake he calls in the adults. In one of the movie�۪s most affecting moments he reveals a devastating turn in the story while the camera narrows in on Ms. Davis using the crumbling landscape of her face to reflect a world falling apart." including cannonball blasts from the Southern past ancient spirits summoned with love and grits and some filler. A veteran screenwriter Mr. LaGravenese has helped adapt a number of heavy and light books for the screen ��� ���A Little Princess �۝ ���The Bridges of Madison County �۝ ���Beloved�۝ ��� and has largely wrestled this one and its original 500 or so pages down to manageable size. Even so the movie almost predictably begins to sag in the middle (even with the judicious modifications there�۪s a lot to cram in) but not tediously so. One scene logically or more important given the supernatural material emotionally builds on the next as Ethan and Lena�۪s story opens up ever so slightly when they find that they may be following the same doomed path as two 19th-century lovers." which is mostly atmospheric though the ornamental scars on Amma�۪s back serve as reminders that there�۪s more to these parts than costume-dress re-creations and adolescent reveries. Ethan sees those scars but their meaning doesn�۪t seem to register with him. For Lena and him history is something that flickers to life only vaguely an idea that�۪s literalized when they go to the movies and a battle scene from the 19th century runs in front of them like a film. The past may not be dead but that�۪s only because it�۪s entertainment."

The relationship between those two ��� Komarov is a former mogul at odds with the Russian government; Irina is an avid consumer of lipstick ��� might have made an interesting parallel to the McClane father-son drama but interesting is the last thing this movie wants to be." ���A Good Day to Die Hard�۝ is squarely aimed at the overseas marketplace.

�۝ Steven Soderbergh�۪s tight and twisty new pharma-caper includes a Web site for a fictitious antidepressant called Ablixa. You can tell the site is fake because the ���professional consultation�۝ it offers is provided by Jude Law who plays a psychiatrist in the film. But the embedded commercial is a perfect parody of something that has become very familiar in recent years: a vague and seductive montage of sad and happy scenes accompanied by new-agey music and interrupting the inspiring sales pitch a sotto voce recitation of warnings and possible complications." who serves as his own cinematographer (under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) cleverly evokes the style of these ubiquitous drug advertisements in the movie itself. We spend most of the first half-hour in the company of Emily Taylor (Rooney Mara) a young New Yorker who lives in a gray fog of hopelessness. The Ablixa ad represents this condition with cartoon clouds while Mr. Soderbergh paints Manhattan in watery shades of gloom. Thomas Newman�۪s score mimics and subverts the soothing music of antidepressant sales pitches composing lullabies that portend a sleep full of nightmares. Ms. Mara fine-boned and fragile-looking but with a deep reservoir of scary intensity (see ���The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo�۝) moves through her scenes with a blunted haunted affect and Emily stirs the protective instincts of the audience of Mr. Law�۪s Dr. Jonathan Banks and also of her husband Martin (Channing Tatum)." including a suicide attempt in an underground parking garage. Martin affable hunky and upbeat (as I said Channing Tatum) also represents the principal happiness that Emily has known in her life. A flashback renders the time before his incarceration as a bright blur of delicious shared luxury: Champagne in crystal flutes a handsome sailboat a cute little Mercedes in the driveway of a grand Greenwich mansion." Mr. Soderbergh�۪s collaborator on ���Contagion�۝ and ���The Informant!�۝) starts out on the pharmacologically renovated terrain of the psychological thriller ��� locating drama and suspense in the puzzles of Emily�۪s inner experience ��� it eventually separates the thrills from the psychology flattening into a somewhat conventional story of double crosses and disguised motives. The movie is finally less about madness and medicine than about lust jealousy and greed." and not that a clever old-fashioned noir potboiler is unwelcome in this cold dumb season. Even as it concentrates on the pathos and pathology of an individual case ���Side Effects�۝ glances at the larger economic forces that impinge on Emily�۪s condition. Behind the kind doctors and enticing advertisements lie the interests of big business. Dr. Banks eager to advance his family�۪s fortune (his wife who works in banking is played by Vinessa Shaw) accepts a lucrative consulting gig for the company that makes Ablixa whose brand seems to be everywhere ��� on name tags at conferences on ballpoint pens and prescription pads." with the not always helpful assistance of Emily�۪s previous therapist (Catherine Zeta-Jones) tries to get to the bottom of a ghastly possibly Ablixia-linked incident." since while the plot may be predictable (and more than a little preposterous) in retrospect Mr. Soderbergh handles it brilliantly serving notice once again that he is a crackerjack genre technician. He is especially alert to the ways that shifts in the direction of the plot alter the identities of important characters. Mr. Law�۪s transformation is especially impressive as the good doctor travels a circuit from compassion to confusion to coldblooded fury and discovers that paranoia is less a psychic disorder than a realistic response to circumstances." �۝ his Liberace biopic starring Matt Damon and Michael Douglas will be shown on HBO.) As such it is less a summing up than a greatest-hits package reminding viewers of some of the things that this protean director has done well in recent years.

It has a clammy medical anxiety that recalls ���Contagion �۝ hints of the corporate shenanigans of ���The Informant! �۝ the do-gooder convictions of ���Erin Brockovich�۝ and an eye for high-end New York environments that defined ���The Girlfriend Experience.�۝" drugs illness and crime are also about money.

For early filmgoers the close-up especially that of the human face projected on big screens signaled a crucial aesthetic difference between movies and theater. Mr. Foreman who founded the famed Ontological-Hysteric Theater in 1968 has for years incorporated video into his stage plays and may well have included videotaped close-ups in his theater works but as a stand-alone recorded work rather than a live performance this feels like a new frontier for him. (He has directed a handful of ���video plays�۝ and one feature film ���Strong Medicine �۝ released in 1981 which featured a glittery lineup including Raul Julia Buck Henry Carol Kane and the filmmaker Jonas Mekas.)" Mr. Foreman signals that he�۪s working in an arena different from where he usually does though there�۪s more here than meets that (rubbed) eye. Perhaps more important these close-ups create a sense of narrative expectation that the face will soon be attached to a name actions emotions and the inevitable story." however consistently deviates from the stories that are deeply inscribed in your consciousness breaking familiar chains of signification.

Absorbed in the sounds and sights of his dilapidated Greenpoint neighborhood Walter sees nothing amiss in adding to his stash of rare Gibson guitars while he his wife and 12-year-old son lack medical insurance. Yet the director Matt Boyd never allows his subject�۪s profound self-involvement to sour the film�۪s moodily compelling tone. Drifting and dreamy Walter�۪s perambulations are scored to the miraculous mournful notes of the rubber band he plays in the subway and the melancholy inflections of his narration." and as we watch him grapple with gentrification commune with abandoned objects and struggle to connect with his religious Southern parents it becomes clear that Walter�۪s obsession with listening does not extend to his nearest and dearest." from aurally disjunctive to visually seductive ���Rubberband�۝ is a languorous ballad of sadness and disappointment.

Beethoven�۪s question is perhaps meant to apply to ���Night Across the Street �۝ Ra̼l Ruiz�۪s elegiac enigmatic and mischievous final film." who was born in Chile in 1941 and spent much of his career in France (where he died in 2011) directed more than 100 films in a half-dozen languages including adaptations of Marcel Proust�۪s ���Time Regained�۝ (1999) and Giono�۪s ���Savage Souls�۝ (2001). According to the opening titles ���Night Across the Street�۝ was ���suggested by�۝ stories by the Chilean writer Hern��n del Solar but it teems with images and references that can only be called Ruizian. Celso is not only the director�۪s compatriot and contemporary but he also shares many of his tastes and interests including an eclectic fanboy love of cinema." Celso drags him to the local theater for a mini-festival of westerns crime dramas and B movies. The composer is overwhelmed perhaps by the medium�۪s prodigious profligate ability to create new realities out of light sound and imagination. Mr. Ruiz was always enchanted by this power and used it to invent an especially serene and elegant form of cinematic surrealism. Unlike his precursors Georges Franju and Luis Bu̱uel who reveled in the shock of incongruity Mr. Ruiz took it in stride. His gliding floating camera could make wild impossibilities look utterly natural." �۝ where the present commingles with the past and seeming is another way of being. One strand of the wandering tangled narrative follows Celso and his friends real and imaginary (not that there�۪s a difference) through the usual boyish circuit of home and school. Meanwhile Old Celso a clerk on the brink of retirement muses on his life and wanders into intrigues and conspiracies that might fill up several more conventional movies." he pursues his own Rosebud whispering ���rhododendron�۝ again and again and inflecting it with various meanings.

Not that there is a single world that would unlock for us or for him the mysteries of Celso�۪s existence (which continues in the film after his death).

The story turns on a thief who sometimes goes by Diana (Melissa McCarthy) who wreaks havoc on a milquetoast Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) by stealing his credit cards and more. The two become one of those belligerent odd couples who are forced on the road together chockablock with stereotypes gun violence visual clich̩s and cruel comedy. Diana a kewpie doll with a crazy smile and five-alarm blaze of hair is the target of most of the jokes but until the filmmakers put out her fire with a bucket of tears and sentimental slop she�۪s also the movie�۪s bliss." but she is the supernova who burns up this show which was written by Craig Mazin and directed by Seth Gordon. Diana enters shortly before Sandy is hired for a job that bumps his income to six figures from five. An Everyman Sandy comes with the usual pretty wife (Amanda Peet) and cute kids with another on the way. More unusually the family is almost broke and lives in an apartment instead of one of those movie dream houses that pass as middle-class homes. Sandy�۪s new position represents a step up for the family which means that Diana doesn�۪t just rip him off she also threatens his upward mobility." �۝ adding some unexpected piquancy to the generic proceedings. Early in the movie there�۪s an aggressively ugly-funny scene between Sandy and a belligerent 1 percenter Harold Cornish (Jon Favreau) who namedrops ���The Fountainhead.�۝ For a few seconds it feels as if someone here were paying attention. Once Sandy finds Diana who�۪s nesting in a Florida house that looks as if it had been dipped in a vat of Pepto-Bismol the movie enters more predicable territory. From her gut-churning pink home to the blue shadow plastered on her eyes Sandy is a cornucopia of conventional bad taste. She�۪s a liar and a thief but she�۪s also tacky low-rent vulgar with a mouth and manners as loud as the floral prints she wears." in other words the unruly woman the woman of glorious excess who with her sharp funny tongue and expansive physicality dominates the screen and her male co-stars often by playing off an idea of femininity. Diana isn�۪t the brilliant gender-bending presence that Ms. McCarthy inhabited so brilliantly in ���Bridesmaids �۝ a movie that rejoiced in messy female behavior. Even so from the moment Diana comes on screen in ���Identity Thief �۝ sugar-talking Sandy out of his information while she�۪s slurping a soda Ms. McCarthy owns the movie. The character may be drawn in broad strokes but Ms. McCarthy slips between the saucy and the demonic with exquisite effortlessness fluttering her lashes and flashing her dimples one minute unleashing her inner Medusa the next." though that is to be expected. Real anarchy has no place in an entertainment like ���Identity Thief�۝: order must be restored the family reunited the wild woman tamed. Diana will teach Sandy something and he will teach her something in turn and then everything will fit tidily phonily together or something like that. That said as is the case with other unsatisfactory diversions it is entirely possible to ignore the worst parts of this movie to drift along during the lulls slide over the half-baked jokes and just wait for Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Bateman to do their things.

The character a wildly successful graphic designer is inspired partly by Charles White III the renowned airbrush illustrator much admired for his album covers of the 1970s. The other inspiration is the louche reputation as well as the name of the movie�۪s star Charlie Sheen who looks much the worse for wear." a cigarette dangling from his lizardy lips this blas̩ reptilian Hugh Hefner manqu̩ is smarting from the rejection of his true love Ivana (Katheryn Winnick). A pouty blonde aspiring actress Ivana walked out on him after discovering a cache of pornographic snapshots of his ex-girlfriends." but even when pleading for Ivana to return this whining scoundrel conveys the shallowness and wounded pride of a spoiled dissolute Lothario who has had the rug pulled out from under him. From the little we see of Ivana she is pretty much a cipher." ���All That Jazz �۝ which explored the fantasy life of its director and choreographer while recovering from a heart attack. Charles lands in a hospital with ominous symptoms that turn out to be signs of stress. If Mr. Sheen demonstrates surprising agility in a Fosse-like dance sequence he has neither the grace nor the angular ferocity to embody the Fosse style fully. And his singing of ���Waters of March�۝ in a duet with Ivana is pathetic." �۝ whose theme of creative blockage is glibly recycled in Charles�۪s futile struggle to come up with a cover concept for an album by his best friend Kirby Star (Jason Schwartzman) a bushy-haired comedic rocker." Izzy. Bill Murray playing his unhappily married business manager Saul issues dire warnings about Charles�۪s profligate spending.

�۝ a riff on Shakespeare�۪s ���Julius Caesar �۝ are cut from coarser more authentic material than that found in most productions. The movie after all is set in an Italian prison and cast almost entirely with real inmates. The prisoners�۪ rough faces and darting eyes the crooked arc of one man�۪s nose and the unnervingly sly line of another�۪s smile suggest so much (murder most foul to borrow a line) as do the occasional shivery biographical asides particularly about the mafia that jostle alongside the play�۪s poetry. These men surely know about betrayal vengeance and power a knife in the gut and hands washed in blood." ���Caesar Must Die�۝ could easily be set in a Wall Street brokerage firm a Hollywood talent agency or a Mexican drug cartel. As it is the veteran directors and brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani shot the story in Rebibbia Prison outside of Rome and used male inmates and several former convicts to play all the roles. Working from their sharply abridged Italian-language adaptation (Fabio Cavalli has a ���screenplay collaboration�۝ credit) the Tavianis open the movie in the play�۪s final act with Brutus (an excellent Salvatore Striano) raising a sword in self-sacrifice. Brutus ��� one of the play�۪s villains and its supremely tragic figure ��� will soon ask an aide to hold the sword so that he can run into it (assisted suicide being one prerogative of his station) an act that closes the circle opened by Caesar�۪s murder." best known for films like ���Padre Padrone�۝ and ���The Night of the Shooting Stars �۝ have their free way with Shakespeare treating ���Julius Caesar�۝ more like a conceptual jumping-off point than like a sacrosanct text. Caesar�۪s wife Calpurnia who memorably cries out in the night (���They murder Caesar!�۝) is missing as is Brutus�۪ wife Portia and assorted friends senators and tribunes. The Senate is gone and so too the Forum and the battlefield. What remains are men: scheming agonizing murdering men. There�۪s an elemental almost primitive quality to the Tavianis�۪ condensing that at its most effective dovetails with the prison�۪s severely circumscribed material reality as if the high walls barred windows and suffocating rooms were manifestations of the characters�۪ states of mind." the story folds back in time to when the production began to take shape six months earlier. The most vivid preliminaries are the auditions which take place in a room as unadorned as an undressed set. Two men their backs to the camera sit at the edges of the frame and address the inmates who stand in the middle facing the camera (and us). Each inmate briefly introduces himself and his life and then acts either with comic overstatement or startling intensity the same nondescript scene. It�۪s somewhat interesting to see these raw presumably untutored actors throw themselves into their performances though there�۪s nothing surprising about the disclosure that some denizens of the criminal world have a talent for dissembling." a striking visual choice for a drama that at least in its unabridged form turns on characters who from scene to scene word to deed are so complexly shaded. (It was shot in high-definition video that has such fine detail that you can play connect the dots with the actors�۪ pores.) The Tavianis�۪ movie is necessarily less involved (it runs 76 minutes) than Shakespeare�۪s play with most of their story given over to men rehearsing. Every so often real life ��� or rather the approximation being played on camera ��� intrudes. Two prisoners bicker while rehearsing a scene their private argument mirroring the dynamics in the drama. This insertion of nominal real life gives the movie a modest shiver but such self-reflexivity feels more ritualistic than revelatory." as in a brief palpably lonely scene of an inmate making coffee in his cell. Again and again though the Tavianis seem to want you to infer something about the inmates from the lines they recite as when Cassius (Cosimo Rega) while washing his hands in Caesar�۪s blood states that the assassins�۪ scene will be repeated a nod at past and future murders as well as at other less bloody performances. You can only guess what the lines mean to the inmates who register as atmospheric blanks at best and brutal exotics at worst even if the tale that they enact with such earnest vigor works because the original tragedy does. The play�۪s the thing to borrow another line far more than the jailhouse setting is which is this movie�۪s great unsurprising revelation."

́lex de la Iglesia�۪s ���As Luck Would Have It�۝ combines lecture farce and soapy sentiment in a single misshapen package." a dejectedly unemployed adman Randy Feldman�۪s screenplay aims for satire but lands squarely on schlock. Immobilized when a ridiculously contrived accident leaves him supine on a museum floor with an iron rod piercing his skull Roberto resolves to monetize the bejesus out of his predicament. Around him is a newly unearthed Roman amphitheater ��� perfect for the gathering storm of paparazzi ��� and ahead lie myriad opportunities to rescue his family from destitution. His body may be trapped but his brain is working overtime." �۝ a riveting 1997 episode of ���Homicide: Life on the Street.�۝ That show made us care about the victim�۪s fate (and not just because he was played by Vincent D�۪Onofrio); here there is nothing but chaos. As Roberto summons an agent and orchestrates a media frenzy paramedics flutter uselessly and his wife Luisa (Salma Hayek oozing affronted dignity) nags him for prioritizing money over family. But though the film�۪s lather of deal-making and product placement firmly indicts tabloid television culture Mr. de la Iglesia can�۪t decide whether to play it straight or twisted. In the end he chooses both resulting in a movie too forgettable even for the medium it chastises."

where its star-crossed blood-drenched lovers will eventually present sweet relief from the apocalyptic freakout that is the AMC series ���The Walking Dead.�۝ If ���The Walking Dead�۝ is ���Lost�۝ with zombies and a high kill rate ���Warm Bodies�۝ is effectively a riff on every teenage romance ever told from Ovid�۪s Pyramus and Thisbe on. Boy or in this case zombie meets girl. Zombie loses girl. Zombie ��� well you know the rest though here the familiar balance comes with human tartare screams and the unsettling image of John Malkovich as the leader of the seemingly last people on Earth." ���Warm Bodies�۝ is an improbable romance sweetened with appealing performances and buoyed by one of the better cute meets in recent romantic comedy when the zombie boy R (Nicholas Hoult) decides not to eat a live girl Julie (Teresa Palmer). And she looks so tasty too a Kristen Stewart type with less fidgeting and a sense of self-preservation. (She�۪s out scouting looking for something nonhuman to eat.) Smitten or stricken R drops everything ��� in this case a half-gnawed corpse ��� and stares into her eyes where intelligence battles fear. He then smears blood on her face to fool his zombie brethren (Rob Corddry included) into thinking that she�۪s dead grunts a few sweet nothings and shuffles off taking her to his lair." he elaborated ���sexual activity has not yet been separated from the ingestion of food.�۝ In order for there to be a story R must learn to keep his monstrous appetite in check so that he can be with Julie and not just consume her. He learns in other words to separate sexual activity from gobbling brains. (Real Freudians should feel free to parse how this zombie boy handles the other stages.) In story terms that means R hangs out with Julie inside the jet that he has turned into his dead-man cave and in which they listen to his vinyl records. They sound he explains alive." ���I Am a Zombie Filled With Love �۝ that its author Isaac Marion expanded into a novel also titled ���Warm Bodies �۝ which earned praise from Stephenie Meyer (the author of the ���Twilight�۝ books) and led inevitably to a movie deal. Given that Summit Entertainment the company releasing ���Warm Bodies �۝ also turned Ms. Meyer�۪s ���Twilight�۝ books into a global screen phenomenon it seems it has decided that romances between sort of dead boys and living girls is a niche it can fill. The resurrection of the vampire as the ultimate suave lover has its understandable appeal. A boy-man like Edward in the ���Twilight�۝ series may be dead but he has old-fashioned manners and unlike his flesh-and-blood contemporaries is in control of his hunger." both less worldly and courtly yet also more recognizable. R keeps his hunger in check without much struggle a process that�۪s personalized through his voice-over and in talky passages that show Mr. Levine�۪s ability to sustain interest with just two people in a room. (Dave Franco and Analeigh Tipton help round out the cast.) The off-the-shelf action scenes mostly involve someone dead or alive chasing someone else who�۪s dead or alive including armies of cheap-looking digital ghouls. Like the story these scenes are familiar if not deadly despite the nuance-killing music. If the movie surmounts its genericism it�۪s largely because of the actors and a love in which the monstrous has been made literal and violent delights don�۪t necessarily lead to violent ends."

�۝ a documentary by Stephen Vittoria is proof that there are still outspoken champions of views too radicalized to qualify as left-wing: people distrustful of law enforcement the political system the justice system the news media and the very notion that America is at heart the land of the free." of course. Mr. Vittoria sets out to tell once again the story of Mumia Abu-Jamal who was convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer more than 30 years ago and to highlight the considerable writing he has done in prison over the decades. From that standpoint the film will appeal to one side of that polarizing case ��� the side that views Mr. Abu-Jamal as a political prisoner and victim of a racist system ��� and enrage the other." with Mr. Vittoria instead letting the film wander considerably to Frederick Douglass and recent American bombings overseas and everything in between." academics like Cornel West and Michelle Alexander and the many other talking heads in this film is certainly a bracing change from the usual back-and-forth of the evening news." 
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/movies/koch-neil-barskys-documentary-on-the-former-mayor.html
�۝ Neil Barsky�۪s new documentary find its subject the former Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York campaigning on a Brooklyn street on behalf of a candidate for the State Assembly in the 2010 election. Though not on the ballot he is right at home shaking hands and making jokes. ���Do you remember me?�۝ Mr. Koch asks potential voters with his characteristic blend of humor bravado and neediness. ���Do you remember me fondly?�۝" but time has a way of turning the furious political battles of the past into amusing war stories and of softening old enmities. Politicians civic leaders and journalists who were thorns in Mr. Koch�۪s side offer measured even affectionate assessments of his administration though some hard feelings persist especially on matters of race." who died at 88 on Friday seems to have mellowed very little. New York may be a safer cleaner and less argumentative place than it was in the 1980s but the Ed Koch of 2010 appears as contentious as mischievous and at times as inflammatory as ever. We see him campaigning for Andrew Cuomo whose father Mario was Mr. Koch�۪s rival in a bitter Democratic primary in 1977 and in the gubernatorial race five years later. We also hear him call the younger Cuomo ���a schmuck�۝ on election night and speak disparagingly of another Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York." in the back of chauffeured cars and even beside his own tombstone ��� Mr. Koch is happy to rehearse old grudges. Regrets and second thoughts however are not in his nature. Admitting that he ���made a mistake�۝ in closing Sydenham Hospital in Harlem during his first term ��� after promising during the campaign to keep it open ��� he goes on to say that he should have followed the example of his predecessors and given in to ���terror �۝ referring to pleas and residents�۪ protests. ���How am I doing?�۝ Mr. Koch used to ask. It was always a rhetorical question." almost a quarter-century after Mr. Koch was unseated by David Dinkins a topic for historical debate. How did he do? The people interviewed in ���Koch�۝ whose names are not Koch ��� several of them former or current employees of The New York Times ��� offer a mixed mostly positive verdict and also flesh out a portrait of a complicated man in an era that is quickly fading in memory. Viewers who were around back then will be reminded of some painful episodes (as well as some funny moments) and those who have known only Republican (or independent) mayors and graffiti-proof subway cars will receive a brisk and informative tour of the city in what few would consider its Golden Age." ���Koch�۝ is above all a chronicle of New York civic life from 1977 to 1989. Mr. Koch a reformist Democratic congressman from Greenwich Village emerged from a crowded primary field to win the nomination at a low point in the fortunes of the city. Jonathan Mahler�۪s 2005 book ���Ladies and Gentlemen the Bronx Is Burning �۝ and Spike Lee�۪s 1999 film ���Summer of Sam �۝ provide vivid snapshots of this moment and Mr. Barsky reminds us of the salient details: the recent fiscal crisis; the fear of a brazen serial killer and more mundane forms of crime; the blackout that seemed in August 1977 like a foretaste of apocalypse." a judgment that contemporary opinion ��� measured in the landslide victories of 1981 and 1985 and symbolized by a Time magazine cover and an Off Broadway musical ��� would seem to support. But even his successes were shadowed by the persistence of crime poverty and a climate of racial hostility that he arguably made worse." Sam Roberts of The Times describes a ���missing synapse�۝ of empathy with the city�۪s African-American population though ���Koch�۝ does not pursue this theme as far as it might. The film includes the murder of Yusuf K. Hawkins in 1989 but it leaves out other episodes like the rape of a jogger in Central Park that same year and the subway vigilantism of Bernhard H. Goetz in 1984." starting in the Parking Violations Bureau that dented his reputation as an incorruptible reformer. Though the film describes Mr. Koch as a pioneer in the blend of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism that has defined many subsequent big-city mayors he has a way of resisting ideological labels. He spent a lot of money on housing (perhaps his most enduring legacy) and was not above dabbling in the post-�۪60s politics of backlash and resentment." another hard-to-classify embodiment of the spirit of New York he is contradictory and multitudinous. The hour and a half Mr. Barsky provides might be enough time for a lesser figure. Mr. Koch ��� who I should note has dabbled in film criticism since leaving Gracie Mansion ��� needs more: a mini-series; a Dreiser novel (Tom Wolfe tried sort of in ���The Bonfire of the Vanities�۝); a sprawling epic combining the talents of Sidney Lumet Woody Allen Bob Fosse and Spike Lee. He is charming infuriating and sometimes coy (especially about his sexuality which he continues to insist is nobody�۪s business). He can be exhausting even in small doses but he has never been boring. Post-Koch New York is duller than it used to be which is probably both a disappointment and a relief."

thought there is a character named John and well you know. This movie written and directed by Don Coscarelli and based on a novel by Jason Pargin (writing under the pseudonym David Wong) is not really about John (Rob Mayes) in any case and is either entirely spoiler-proof or completely self-spoiling. It lays waste to linear narration thematic coherence psychological plausibility and just about everything else you might expect to encounter. It zigs zags and trips over its own feet and on its own home-brewed hallucinogens. It�۪s a ridiculous preposterous sometimes maddening experience but also kind of a blast." and he is a friend of John�۪s with a wild story to tell. In a small-town Chinese restaurant Dave meets with a journalist (Paul Giamatti) who is eager to hear Dave�۪s revelations about a vast possibly interplanetary time- and space-defying conspiracy involving a highly addictive drug known as soy sauce predatory insects prosthetic hands (as well as other body parts) and some fairly grisly homicides. The agents of this scheme are hard to distinguish from its victims and despite Dave�۪s earnest efforts his experience defies summary." of course the point. ���John Dies at the End�۝ revels in its anarchic lack of structure happily swerving from stoner comedy to gutbucket horror to ���Donnie Darko�۝-esque sci-fi allegory without pausing or slowing down. The more explanation there is the more confusing the whole thing becomes until it lets go of all sense in a way that is at once exhilarating and weirdly moving." switch identities and do things that make no sense at all you might be tempted to conclude that the cast and the filmmakers just made the movie up as they went along. It has the loose goofy feel of a project that a bunch of college students (or dropouts in Dave�۪s case) might dream up during a long weekend of beer and bong hits. And yet at the same time it looks like a real movie ��� artfully shot cleanly edited and very much in control of the laughs and scares that arise from its insanely convoluted set of premises." neither Dave nor David Wong his namesake and creator may be entirely in control of the situation but Mr. Coscarelli a veteran cult auteur knows what he�۪s doing. His r̩sum̩ includes the ���Phantasm�۝ horror franchise and the incomparable ���Bubba Ho-Tep �۝ which may convince even die-hard skeptics that Elvis is alive. Not really ��� not any more than ���John Dies at the End�۝ will raise alarms about a diabolical intergalactic soy-sauce-based plot to destroy humanity. These movies are in every sense unbelievable. Which means they just might restore your faith in absurdity." profanity drug use."

and women are sick of it says ���Girls Against Boys �۝ a dumb dreary let�۪s-get-back-at-them slasher in which pulverized genitals pass for feminist critique." the film�۪s writer and director Austin Chick shores up his rickety exploitation scenario with the boilerplate vocabulary of a gender-studies class in which our vapid heroine Shae (Danielle Panabaker) takes copious notes. But when her married lover dumps her and the honking mating calls of the men at the bar where she moonlights grow irksome Shae is ripe for a night of boozy abandon with her fellow barmaid Lu (Nicole LaLiberte). Who would have thought that staggering to a scummy apartment with three sketchy guys could be so dangerous?" though because Lu packing bondage accessories and a samurai sword is eager to train Shae in the finer points of male sterilization and dismemberment. ���Everybody did something �۝ she insists as their scantily clothed vendetta progresses with foot-dragging tedium and a baffling lack of logical consequences. Add some moodily blurred photography and a script that strains to differentiate between female empowerment and male titillation and you have one very confused film." however: using the same dazed bovine stare to telegraph shock desire pensiveness and murderous resolve she makes ���Girls Against Boys�۝ less a battle of the sexes than a wipeout by the witless." amputated feet and a neutered cop."

in other words an appreciation and awareness of the principles of contemporary action cinema and perhaps even a sense of play in respect to the genre. And while the veteran action director Walter Hill hasn�۪t done much to enliven this dull unmemorable material with its mechanically moving parts and popping gunfire its dull-red splatter and spray he has brought a spark of wit to the proceedings starting with the figure of Sylvester Stallone." along with Mr. Hill whose credits include ���The Driver �۝ ���The Warriors�۝ and ���48 Hrs.�۝ Needless to say both men have seen better days and certainly better screenplays. This one written by Alessandro Camon is based on a French graphic novel ���Du Plomb Dans la T̻te �۝ which was written by Matz (a k a Alexis Nolent) and illustrated by Colin Wilson and whose title roughly somewhat amusingly translates as ���Lead in the Head.�۝ The story involves the usual collection of bad badder and baddest men shooting and sometimes slugging it out in a New Orleans so anonymous it might as well be a studio back lot. Some men die and some men live though frankly there isn�۪t all that much distinguishing the quick from the dead." a contract killer who lives in a tough-guy stronghold on the water (the association between him and swamp creatures seems intentional) Mr. Stallone doesn�۪t so much play a character as wear the mask of the ethically legally and grammatically challenged loner. Short on long talk Bobo spits out words like nails (���I got some rules�۝) and uses a gun to pound in his meaning. One advantage of such taciturn brutalism is that there�۪s no need to second-guess him: he does what he promises as when he tells someone ���I�۪m going to kill you.�۝ There�۪s an absurdly comic purity to lines like this that suggest that the filmmakers having already ignored little details like complex characters and psychological motivations decided to whittle the whole thing down to its generic core." the lean-looking Mr. Stallone shoulders the weight of that core shakily but determinedly. Although he shares the burden with co-stars like Jon Seda and Jason Momoa the movie most probably owes its existence to Mr. Stallone and the movie history he hauls along with him. He seems more totem than man these days which partly has to do with the flickering specters of Rocky and Rambo but also with the ravages of age and other assaults. To look at the cubistic arrangement that constitutes Mr. Stallone�۪s face and to witness his fairly restricted physical performance ��� he apparently fractured his neck a few years ago and now barely seems able to turn his head ��� is to gaze upon a god at twilight. He is at once unearthly and more poignantly human than he has been in years." and there�۪s some especially awful razzing between Bobo and his odd-couple partner an out-of-town cop Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang). Much of this involves would-be cutting comments about Kwon�۪s heritage (hence the idiotic references to Bruce Lee kung fu and the like) which suggest that someone was trying to replicate the banter from ���48 Hrs. �۝ one of Mr. Hill�۪s best films. The exchanges fall flat as does so much here including a little family filler with Bobo�۪s daughter (Sarah Shahi one of the token women) and some all-purpose intrigue with a couple of suits (Christian Slater and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). No one here seems to notice that there�۪s not much going on including Mr. Stallone which somehow makes it easier to watch."

Rife with game clips of fights and face-punching reminiscences the film settles on one remarkable veteran Chris Nilan the Boston-born resident bruiser of the Montreal Canadiens in the 1980s known as Knuckles. Mr. Nilan�۪s candidly told story of goon-made-good is followed through hubristic fallouts with management and all the way downhill into the self-medicated rock bottom not uncommon post fame." Mr. Gibney recognizes a rare storyteller who pairs emotional candor and self-critical toughness with an almost pulpy often profane style. Speaking with a West Roxbury razz as do his family members and friends the heavy-browed Mr. Nilan who soon turns 55 proudly claims the satisfactions of violence defends codes of honor on ice with bravado and grows tearful over the Stanley Cup Dad and drugs." with headlinelike titles to boot Mr. Gibney ordinarily rolls out hungry expos̩s like ���Casino Jack�۝ and ���Mea Maxima Culpa �۝ and the occasional pop-cultural history lesson. He scales down his approach considerably here generally for the better rather than extrapolate a theory of violence and everything. ���The Last Gladiators�۝ is very much about a particular part of ice hockey the heavies rather than the Gretzkies." complete with the tale of woe as Mr. Nilan recounts his wobbly recovery from substance abuse. Much may be familiar to fans and the players do carry the day; the sports journalists who blandly recite commentary could learn from the athletes�۪ earthy style." the stories of dropped gloves and smashed faces shed some clarity on the game�۪s violence not as some vague menace but as a fact the product of a drive that yields for these men intoxicating high points that are rarely reattained."

Mr. Wirkola envisions the grown-up Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) who have amassed quite a reputation as witch hunters and are summoned to a village where children have been disappearing in alarming numbers." Mr. Wirkola doesn�۪t sugarcoat his witches: these are nasty creatures who desperately need some anti-wrinkle cream and are exceedingly difficult to kill. But Hansel and Gretel aren�۪t having nearly as much fun doing that job as brother-sister witch hunters ought to." and the script doesn�۪t give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status which is odd since the producers include Will Ferrell.

In ���Happy People: A Year in the Taiga �۝ Mr. Herzog airdrops us into the vast Siberian taiga (a sprawling region of subarctic forest) for a seasonal portrait focusing on fur trappers.

One bearded trapper says he received his stake of land in the early 1970s suggesting an autonomy that transcends the passing of empires.

As they run into trouble and optimism turns first to anxiety and then to desperation their fragile solidarity is tested and so is each individual�۪s capacity for cowardice bravery and compassion. At one point they encounter another boat whose engine has failed and the pleas of the Africans on board represent a terrible moral dilemma and also perhaps an omen. Should Baye Laye and the others on his pirogue risk their own lives by helping the others or should they turn away in the interests of their own survival?" rather than melodramatically.

big beautiful soul-dirty town in ���Broken City�۝ looks as if it were built from shattered glass. That�۪s especially true from the air where the director Allen Hughes likes to take a god�۪s-eye measure of what�۪s below the camera gliding over the glittering lights and shadows as black as the abyss. This is a place so ominous that the sun never seems to shine leaving the gray streets and people washed in an icy blue light. One glance and it�۪s obvious that this is New York though it�۪s a city Mr. Hughes has painted a darker shade of noir." from his first movie ���Menace II Society �۝ to his most recent ���The Book of Eli.�۝ Along the way his features ��� all except ���Broken City�۝ were directed with his twin brother Albert ��� have shifted from youthful nihilism to pessimism to a less totalizing pessimism one that leaves room for something approaching or at least nodding toward hope change possibility. The exits in other words are no longer completely blocked. Whether this reflects age a philosophical shift or studio pressure the movies feel less closed in than they once did. There�۪s plenty of bleak to go around in ���Broken City �۝ yet there is also more tonal variation and a worldview that hews toward human complexity rather than toward comic-book Manichaeism." if you tune out a bit and instead watch the screen ��� notice how the restless cameras prowl around the actors and how shards of bright color pierce the pooling black night ��� then ���Broken City�۝ satisfies like the solid B movie it is. Written by Brian Tucker the story traces if somewhat distractedly the moral education of Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) a cop who shortly after the movie opens shoots a man dead and is forced to turn in his badge. It�۪s the sort of blunt early narrative shock a triggering incident as it were that strongly suggests where the rest of the story will lead." �۝ though the question of whether Billy is a good or bad man a decent or dirty lawman ��� and the equally important matter of whether the shooting was justified ��� hovers in the background like a half-finished thought. One reason is that Mr. Tucker who�۪s also a playwright thickens the plot of this his first produced feature with a larger-stakes corruption tale involving the mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe miscast but charismatic) the mayor�۪s wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones classing up the joint nicely) and an assortment of courtiers and connivers including a Machiavellian police commissioner Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright bearded bald and sly). Also stirring up trouble is a mayoral rival with wet beseeching eyes and a cartoon name Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper very fine)." and there�۪s a pretty blonde Katy (Alona Tal) taking his messages at a desk. Given the old-school setup and the intimations of gumshoes and genres past the blonde should be giving her boss the once over as she straightens the seams on her stockings. Mostly while clearly soft on him she just pleasantly nags Billy for not chasing down delinquent clients. He�۪s that type of guy which is another reason that doubts about his character never loom especially large. Although really it�۪s Mr. Wahlberg�۪s native good-guy appeal that keeps doubts at bay." untroubled face and singsong Bostonese Mr. Wahlberg was built to play regular hard-working light-thinking Joes who even when they�۪re on the wrong side of the law are never on the side of the damned. Unlike Mr. Crowe whose peering wary eyes always make it look as if he�۪s working an angle sussing out the competition (and co-stars) to gain an advantage Mr. Wahlberg often looks almost surprised by what�۪s happening around him. That may not always be a useful quality for a detective but it can work well for a filmmaker and an ethically and narratively challenged protagonist. In ���Broken City�۝ Billy is always lagging behind events and other people running into a scene after a deadly shot has been fired misinterpreting gestures and making missteps that only make him vulnerable." �۝ despite its puddling sometimes muddling mysteries. This is a story after all about power and its abuse in the city and eight million of these have been told before. Mr. Hughes tells this latest iteration with characteristic technical virtuosity and while he�۪s overly fond of circling camera movements the silky gyrating choreography of the cinematography does create a sense of a spinning web that works reasonably well. His visual choices can feel borrowed and clich̩d but his regard for beauty often compensates for his blunders as does the sturdy reliable appeal of another story of good and evil men and women light and dark glass and steel sex and power. As it turns out there are eight million and one stories in the naked city."

Working with the director of photography Iv��n Gierasinchuk and shooting in high-end digital Mr. ́vila creates an intimate richly tactile and impressionistic picture of a once-upon-a-time in childhood using close-ups of hands mouths and eyes in certain scenes that feel more remembered than lived in." vividly animated interlude by Andy Riva that has a jagged blunt graphic-novel look that�۪s better suited to the story�۪s grimmer truths. (Mr. Riva also animated several other sequences including a light bright childlike one with Che Guevara.) The animated sections pop but it�۪s unclear if Juan sees his life as a comic book and is coping with its brute reality by transforming it into a cartoon. Or is Mr. ́vila ��� who in telling this seductive adult story through a child ended up limiting its depth and scope ��� trying to say something about personal and political memory? When a filmmaker proves as reluctant as Mr. ́vila to speak up about the past to engage with its full complexity it can be hard to hear what he�۪s saying."

it flickers today and is gone tomorrow. In ���56 Up�۝ ��� the latest installment in Michael Apted�۪s remarkable documentary project that has followed a group of Britons since 1964 starting when they were 7 ��� entire lifetimes race by with a few edits. One minute a boy is merrily bobbing along. The next he is 56 years old with a wife or an ex a few children or none a career a job or just dim prospects. Rolls of fat girdle his middle and thicken his jowls. He has regrets but their sting has usually softened along with everything else." you will care and deeply partly because you watched that boy grow up suffer and triumph in a project that began as a news gimmick and social experiment and turned into a plangent human drama. Conceived as a one-off for a current-affairs program on Granada Television the first film ���Seven Up! �۝ was a 40-minute look at the lives of 14 children from different backgrounds. Britain was changing or so went the conventional wisdom with postwar affluence having led the working class to adopt middle-class attitudes and lifestyles." though the sociologists John H. Goldthorpe and David Lockwood disputed this widely held ���embourgeoisement thesis �۝ arguing that the erosion of social class had not been as great as believed. In its deeply personal fashion the ���Up�۝ series went on to make much the same point by checking in with many of the same boys and girls men and women every seven years. Despite some dropouts the group has remained surprisingly intact. For better and sometimes worse and even with their complaints about the series participants like Tony Walker who wanted to be a jockey and found his place as a cabby have become cyclical celebrities. For longtime viewers they have become something more including mirrors." Mr. Apted again folds in older material from the ages of 7 14 and so on to set the scene and jog memories. The abrupt juxtapositions of epochs can be jarring unnerving or touching ��� sometimes all three ��� as bright-faced children bloom and sometimes fade within seconds. An analogous project in print or even still photographs wouldn�۪t be as powerful because what gives the ���Up�۝ series its punch is not so much its longevity or the human spectacle it offers but that these are moving images of touchingly vibrant lives at certain moments in time and space. The more you watch the more the movies transform from mirrors into memory machines ones that inevitably summon reflections of your own life." �۝ filmed in gorgeous black and white the documentaries are aesthetically unremarkable. Shot in digital ���56 Up�۝ pretty much plays like the earlier movies with its mix of interviews and location shooting. Every so often you hear someone off screen presumably Mr. Apted make a comment though mostly he lets his choice of what to show ��� the subjects at work or play with family or friends ��� and his editing do his editorializing. In the past he has brought participants together but he doesn�۪t here which feels like a missed opportunity. Have the three childhood friends from the East End of London Jackie Bassett Lynn Johnson and Sue Sullivan two of whom have recently endured heart-rendingly bad times remained in contact? Mr. Apted doesn�۪t say." everyone seems to have remained fairly locked in his or her original social class. At 7 Andrew Brackfield and John Brisby already knew which universities they would or should attend. ���We think �۝ John said in ���Seven Up! ���I�۪m going to Cambridge and Trinity Hall �۝ though he landed at Oxford. Like Mr. Brackfield who did attend Cambridge Mr. Brisby became a lawyer and still sounds to the manner born with an accent that evokes old-fashioned news readers and Bond villains. The two hold instructively different views about whether the series corroborates the first film�۪s thesis about the rigidity of the British class structure never mind that their lives are strong evidence that little has changed." who was born in 1941 was a researcher at Granada when he helped find the original children for ���Seven Up!�۝ By the second installment ���7 Plus Seven �۝ the series had lost its excited punctuation and its first director Paul Almond. Mr. Apted has ably shepherded the series while also directing fiction films like ���Coal Miner�۪s Daughter�۝ and ���The World Is Not Enough.�۝ After its third chapter the ���Up�۝ series also lost a participant with the withdrawal of Charles Furneaux who attended the same exclusive school with Andrew and John at which the 7-year-olds sang ���Waltzing Matilda�۝ in Latin. Mr. Furneaux went on to become a documentary filmmaker. There may be a lesson in his departure although maybe he just didn�۪t like sharing his life." aggrieved and at times angry though usually their complaints have been expressed with British restraint. Mostly they have voiced an ambivalence that rarely emerges from subjects in documentary film or reality television. Today people expect their 15 seconds but not these souls. And yet for all their reservations they opened their mouths hearts homes veins. They�۪ve shown that class is alive and well in Britain even as the documentaries have also exposed that sharing your life with the public receiving its love and its criticism can itself be a profoundly complex leveler."

�۝ Steve Butler insists and one of the reasons ���Promised Land�۝ works is that he�۪s right. Played by Matt Damon (who wrote the screenplay with John Krasinski) Steve a corporate predator who is also a true believer in his company�۪s cause is both the apparent villain and a magnet for the audience�۪s sympathy." which has caused an economic boom ��� as well as considerable environmental worry ��� in places that sit atop gas-rich shale. ���Promised Land �۝ directed by Gus Van Sant is an earnest attempt sometimes effective sometimes clumsy to dramatize the central arguments about fracking and its impact. Issues that have been addressed in Josh Fox�۪s documentary ���Gasland�۝ and in a series of articles by Ian Urbina in The New York Times crystallize in the story of Steve a man whose ambition comes into conflict with his conscience." though. What is most impressive about Steve when we first meet him is that his job is also a cause. An Iowa native who watched his hometown fade away after a nearby factory closed down he is convinced that rural life cannot be sustained by agriculture alone." he arrives in a small farming town believing that he is offering the local landowners a lifeline. Some of them hearing the amounts his company is offering for drilling rights to their land are eager to sign up but Steve runs into trouble when an old-timer (Hal Holbrook) starts raising questions about what fracking will do to the water supply the livestock and the land itself." who treads the same line between awesome guy and smug jerk that he has so gracefully walked in the later seasons of ���The Office.�۝ Dustin is Steve�۪s rival and mirror image a more obnoxious and more effective version of the friendly young salesman who is charming the locals with a mixture of straight talk and transparent bluff." which annoys Steve. Even worse is that Dustin seems to share Steve�۪s interests in Alice (Rosemarie DeWitt) the pretty schoolteacher that every small town in a movie like this one must have." almost magical geezer (that is Mr. Holbrook�۪s job); semi-sleazy public officials; sassy waitresses; and a lot of guys in plaid flannel shirts and trucker hats. But the nice thing about this movie is that it spends most of its running time wandering away from its native clich̩s rather than wallowing in them." watchful and low-key puts character ahead of story and the script invites the actors to be warm funny and prickly. All of them ��� perhaps most notably Ms. McDormand and Titus Welliver playing a cynical store owner ��� are excellent company and you can see why Steve seems to be in no hurry to wrap up his business and move on." however has a point to make and it does so in a way that is both honorable and disappointing. It admirably tries to represent both sides of the fracking debate even though its allegiance is clearly to the antifracking position. There is nothing wrong with such advocacy except that in this case it means that the movie veers away from its strengths ending in a welter of convenient (and dubious) plot twists and puffed-up speeches." studiously ambiguous conclusion. Those seeking scientific information will need to look elsewhere ��� not that rigorous science is what anyone expects from a movie. But ���Promised Land�۝ feels divided against itself not quite sure how to reconcile its polemical intentions with its storytelling impulses and thus finally unable to fulfill its own promise." strong language."

�۝ Miguel Gomes�۪s odd and sometimes entrancing new film memorably at the beginning where it is used (in a voice-over) to describe a Portuguese explorer making his wistful way through the wilds of Africa haunted by ghosts and threatened by crocodiles. This poor intrepid soul is a character in a movie that is watched by Pilar (Teresa Madruga) a middle-aged single woman living in modern Lisbon. Her unadventurous middle-class euro zone existence is melancholy in its own way. Like the explorer Pilar is filmed in narrow-screen black-and-white which casts a glow of nostalgic mystery over her everyday dealings with friends and neighbors." a bossy dotty old lady who occupies the apartment next to Pilar�۪s and whose periodic crises ��� usually arguments with her Cape Verdean maid Santa (Isabel Cardoso) ��� turn Pilar into a reluctant surrogate daughter. The triangle that develops among the three women of different classes and generations has a faintly Almod�_varian feel but with sighing resignation replacing loud melodrama as the dominant mood. For almost precisely half of Mr. Gomes�۪s emphatically bifurcated story we are in a cinematic reality that while identifiably present tense also evokes the soul-sick European art cinema of the early 1960s." vaguely philosophical conversations unfold in front of a stationary camera. Meaning seems to reside less in the actions or motives of characters than in the atmosphere that envelopes them. And then all of a sudden we are back in that era and at the same time in a more distant world of silent film and high-toned romance. The second part of ���Tabu�۝ recounts the passions and follies of Aurora�۪s youth when she lived on a plantation at the foot of a mountain in an unnamed African colony." the young Aurora (Ana Moreira) was also the lover of a traveler named Ventura (Carloto Cotta) who as an old man (Henrique Esp�_rito Santo) tells the tale of their affair. There is no dialogue in this part of ���Tabu �۝ though ambient sounds and musical performances filter in as if conjured by Ventura�۪s vivid and yes melancholy reminiscences. He and his buddy M��rio (Manuel Mesquita) performed in a rock �۪n�۪ roll band which entertained the idle white youth as black servants wandered around with trays of lemonade." in which rich Europeans act out their desires against a backdrop of imperial privilege. There are intimations subtle at first and increasingly pronounced that the empire is unraveling. Portugal�۪s African wars which began in 1961 and lasted well into the next decade were an especially brutal episode in the history of postwar decolonization but in ���Tabu�۝ that violence is a shadow and a rumor." ���Tabu�۝ views colonialism as an aesthetic opportunity rather than a political or moral problem. It is full of longing ��� hedged self-conscious but palpable all the same ��� for a vanished way of life in contrast to which contemporary reality seems drab and numb." playing hide and seek in the jungles of movie history. ���Tabu�۝ shares its title with a 1931 film by F. W. Murnau that also traffics in exoticism (in the South Pacific not Africa) and that is similarly split in two sections called ���Paradise�۝ and ���Paradise Lost.�۝ The themes of innocence and sin percolate in Mr. Gomes�۪s century-straddling stylistically heterogeneous narrative but he is interestingly sly about how they are distributed between past and present. If the film enacts a fall it is from a relatively guiltless present into a more corrupt past that is also a realm of greater beauty and more intense feeling." and ���Tabu�۝ makes it convincing only within the narrow compass of its own artifice. It is of course art rather than history ��� an elegant composition of dreams memories and suggestive images ��� but its artfulness seems like an alibi an excuse for keeping the ugliness of history out of the picture."

�۪�ʉ۝ my teenage daughter said as the end credits rolled at a screening of Quentin Tarantino�۪s ���Django Unchained.�۝ She was teasing me ��� it�۪s a sad fact of my life that some of the people I�۪m fondest of do not seem to share my fondness for Steven Spielberg�۪s latest movie ��� but also suggesting an interesting point of comparison." �۝ the one a sober historical drama and the other a wild and bloody live-action cartoon are essentially about different solutions to the same problem. You could almost imagine the two films or at least their heroes figuring in the kind of good-natured racial-stereotype humor that used to be a staple of stand-up comedy (and was memorably parodied on ���The Simpsons�۝): ���white guys abolish slavery like this�۝ (pass constitutional amendment); ���but black guys they abolish slavery like this�۝ (blow up plantation)." as well as a measure of suspicion ��� to a subject full of pain and fraught with peril. Mr. Spielberg in his ambitious history-minded projects hews to the proud (though sometimes mocked) tradition of the Hollywood A picture in which big themes are addressed with appropriately sweeping visual and emotional gestures. Mr. Tarantino finds inspiration in what are still frequently seen as less reputable genres and styles: Asian martial arts movies spaghetti westerns blaxploitation." at this point to choose. Among Mr. Tarantino�۪s achievements has been his successful argument that the maligned and neglected B movies of the past should be viewed with fresh eyes and unironic respect. His own tributes to the outlaw outsider film tradition ��� flamboyant in their scholarly care and in their bold originality ��� have suggested new ways of taking movies seriously. ���Django Unchained�۝ is unabashedly and self-consciously pulpy with camera moves and musical cues that evoke both the cornfed westerns of the 1950s and their pastafied progeny of the next decade. (The title comes from a series of Italian action movies whose first star Franco Nero shows up here in a cameo.) It is digressive jokey giddily brutal and ferociously profane. But it is also a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism." ���Django Unchained�۝ is obviously a companion to ���Inglourious Basterds �۝ in which Mr. Tarantino had the audacity to turn the Nazi war against the Jews into the backdrop for a farcical ultraviolent caper. He did not simply depart from the facts of history inventing in the title characters a squad of mostly Jewish-American killers led by a United States Army lieutenant from Tennessee; he rewrote the past in the vivid visceral language of film fantasy." but rather to carry out a vicarious belated and altogether impossible form of revenge using the freedom of cinematic make-believe to even the score." �۝ ���Django Unchained�۝ is crazily entertaining brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness. Christoph Waltz who played the charming sadistic SS officer Hans Landa in ���Basterds �۝ here plays Dr. King Schultz a charming sadistic German bounty hunter (masquerading as an itinerant dentist) whose distaste for slavery makes him the hero�۪s ally and mentor." first glimpsed in shackles and rags on a cold Texas night in 1858 is Django (Jamie Foxx) who becomes Schultz�۪s sidekick and business partner. Schultz is an amoral gun for hire tracking down fugitives and habitually choosing the first option offered in the formulation ���Wanted: Dead or Alive.�۝" as the duo�۪s mission shifts from Schultz�۪s work to the rescue of Django�۪s wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). After the couple tried to run away from their former plantation together they were whipped and branded (the horrific punishment is shown in flashback) and Broomhilda was sold." a Mississippi estate whose debonair master Calvin Candie is played with almost indecent flair by Leonardo DiCaprio. Candie is assisted in his savagery by Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) a house slave who may be the most shocking invention in ���Django Unchained.�۝ He is an Uncle Tom whose servility has mutated into monstrosity and who represents the symbolic self Django must destroy to assert and maintain his freedom." by Mr. Tarantino�۪s standards fairly linear without the baroque chronology of ���Pulp Fiction�۝ or the parallel story lines of ���Inglourious Basterds.�۝ But the movie does take its time and it wanders over a wide expanse of geographic and thematic territory." suspense-filled set pieces there are moments of pure silliness like a gathering of hooded night riders (led by Don Johnson) and a late escapade (featuring Mr. Tarantino speaking in an Australian accent) that perhaps owes more to Bugs Bunny than to any other cultural archetype." the realm of the archetypal is where popular culture lives and Mr. Tarantino does not hesitate to train his revisionist energies on some deep and ancient national legends. Like many westerns ���Django Unchained�۝ latches onto a simple stark picture of good and evil and takes homicidal vengeance as the highest ��� if not the only ��� form of justice." and in making its agent a black former slave Mr. Tarantino exposes and defies an ancient taboo. With the brief and fascinating exception of the blaxploitation movies and a few other works of radical or renegade art vengeance in the American imagination has been the virtually exclusive prerogative of white men. More than that the sanctification and romanticization of revenge have been central to the ideology of white supremacy." �۝ his classic study of the mythology of the frontier from colonial times to the eve of the Civil War the literary historian Richard Slotkin identifies two essential mythic figures: the captive usually an innocent woman held against her will by ruthless and alien usurpers and the hunter who is obsessed with protecting her honor and sometimes secondarily securing her freedom. (���The Searchers �۝ with John Wayne as the hunter and Natalie Wood as the captive is perhaps the most sophisticated modern version of this narrative.)" and yet the roles historically were not intended for them. Some abolitionist works like ���Uncle Tom�۪s Cabin�۝ could paint slavery as a form of captivity but the canonical captives of antebellum American literature were white women kidnapped by Indians who after the Civil War were often replaced by freed slaves as objects of superstitious terror. The idea that regenerative violence could be visited by black against white instead of the reverse ��� that a man like Django could fill out the contours of the hunter ��� has been almost literally unthinkable." so much more regrettable than what passes without comment in ���Jack Reacher�۝ or ���Taken 2.�۝ Mr. Tarantino is a virtuoso of bloodshed that is for sure and also more enamored of a particularly toxic racial slur than any decent white man should be. But decency in the conventional sense is not his concern though in another sense it very much is. When you wipe away the blood and the anarchic humor what you see in ���Django Unchained�۝ is moral disgust with slavery instinctive sympathy for the underdog and an affirmation (in the relationship between Django and Schultz) of what used to be called brotherhood." �۝ after all. And if ���Django Unchained�۝ is not better it is arguably more radical both as cinema and as (fanciful) history. A double feature might be just the thing if you have five and a half hours to spare. By any means necessary!"

In the first number (���Look Down�۝) set against a digitally enhanced visibly artificial port Valjean helps haul an enormous ship into a dock. Dressed mainly in cardinal red the prisoners pull on ropes while singing during a lashing rain with Javert glaring down at them. (And yes he will fall.)" Valjean hasn�۪t just been handed his release papers after 19 years as a prisoner he has also become a Christ figure hoisting a preposterously large wooden pole on to his shoulder. Mr. Hooper�۪s maximalist approach is evident the very moment the scene begins ��� the camera swooping as waves and music crash ��� setting an overblown tone that rarely quiets. His work in this passage from the roller-coaster moves of the cameras to the loud incidental noise that muffles the lyrics undermines his actors and begins to push the musical from spectacle toward bloat. Mr. Jackman suffers the most from Mr. Hooper�۪s approach as when Valjean paces up and down a hallway while delivering ���What Have I Done �۝ a to-and-fro that witlessly needlessly literalizes the character�۪s internal struggle." as opposed to having the singers lip-sync recorded songs as has been customary in movie musicals since the 1930s yields benefits. That�۪s especially the case with Ms. Hathaway Mr. Redmayne and Daniel Huttlestone a scene-stealer who plays the Th̩nardiers�۪ young son. (This isn�۪t the first contemporary musical to resurrect the practice of live singing which was used for both ���At Long Last Love �۝��directed by Peter Bogdanovich and ���The Commitments �۝ directed by Alan Parker.) It�۪s touching watching performers like Ms. Hathaway and Mr. Redmayne giving it their all complete with quavering chins and straining tendons. Mr. Redmayne an appealing actor with a freckled face built for wonder at times seems to be stretching his long body to hit his higher notes." even if their romance lacks spark. Then again so does the movie. Song after song as relationships and rebellion bloom you wait in vain for the movie to as well and for the filmmaking to rise to the occasion of both its source material and its hard-working performers." �۝ Mr. Hooper can be very good with actors. But his inability to leave any lily ungilded ��� to direct a scene without tilting or hurtling or throwing the camera around ��� is bludgeoning and deadly. By the grand finale when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat." poverty face boils and revolution."

tense films that resemble psychological thrillers but are distinguished by their strange story turns moral thorns visual beauty and filmmaking intelligence. His latest to open in the United States ���Barbara �۝ begins in 1980 with an East German doctor from Berlin (Nina Hoss) who after an unspecified offense has been recently banished to the boonies. There in between hospital rounds and harassment from the secret police she waits and she burns." like the 1966 classic ���The Battle of Algiers �۝ and works that more by virtue of their aesthetic choices join the opposition. ���Barbara�۝ is another type of resistance movie. That�۪s partly because it concerns a dissident who with modest obstinate anger pushes back against totalitarianism but also because Mr. Petzold refuses movie clich̩s as strongly as he does political orthodoxy. At once regionally specific and a student of all cinema he draws on numerous traditions and makes them his own. His early love of Hitchcock for one is evident in the prickles of unease that creep into his work creating a cold climate of paranoia and an oft-justified fear of an imminent threat." almost as soon as Barbara appears she�۪s being watched by another East German. Her watcher is a young doctor Andre (Ronald Zehrfeld) a friendly looking teddy bear who peers at her from an upper-story window. There�۪s someone else in the room too: Klaus Sch�_tz (Rainer Bock) a dry severe gray man whose officiousness envelops him like a cloud of dust. ���Is that her?�۝ Andre asks. The scene seems innocent enough ��� just two men gossiping about a new colleague ��� but that�۪s only because it has yet to be revealed that Klaus works for the Stasi the East German secret police. He confirms her identity and then adds a curious observation: ���If she were 6 you�۪d say she�۪s sulky.�۝" petulant wary ��� all these initially seem true of Barbara so much so that you may forget that this unflattering condescending characterization has been made by a Stasi operative. The implication is that she�۪s like a child and therefore incapable of making her own choices an idea that helps define the political reality. Ms. Hoss who has appeared in several of Mr. Petzold�۪s films is a striking woman with a delicate face dominated by large wide-set somewhat baggy eyes. For much of the film she wears her blond hair pulled away from her face which makes her character appear simultaneously vulnerable and watchful. (There�۪s nowhere to hide not even under a curtain of hair.) If Barbara is always watching her watchers and looking over her shoulder she has reason." putting on a good-spy bad-spy show. Klaus who regularly searches her apartment frightens her. Andre an intensely warm sympathetic presence intrigues her. As she moves between the men ��� they each pull at her she pushes right back at them ��� she is simultaneously swept up in the life of Stella (Jasna Fritzi Bauer) a young runaway from a work camp who lands in the hospital. Barbara also secretly meets with her lover J̦rg (Mark Waschke). After they make love on a forest floor he leaves her with stockings West German cigarettes and a promise that adds to the thickening plot." Mr. Petzold puts his pieces into play gradually. Early scenes some nominally observational others more overtly dramatic unfold with no obvious narrative connection. In one sequence Barbara receives a stash of money from a stranger; in other scenes she reads ���Adventures of Huckleberry Finn�۝ aloud to the bedridden Stella. In some of the most visually arresting passages in this quietly beautiful movie Barbara bikes alone along a country road next to a stand of windblown trees her only accompaniment the sounds of the howling wind churning leaves and cawing sea gulls. In time though particularly after J̦rg discusses an escape plan with Barbara and after Andre speaks of the individual�۪s responsibility to the collective these outwardly disconnected pieces fit together." �۝ a colleague snipes. Mr. Petzold takes his time revealing what makes Barbara tick so that the full depth of her character emerges through her dealings with other people through how she reacts to Klaus�۪s searches Andre�۪s attentions and Stella�۪s troubles. Each presses on her insistently. Barbara doesn�۪t necessarily say much in return but with her arms folded across her body she conveys a great deal. At one point though those arms drop. And while Barbara may just look like she�۪s letting down her defenses what you witness is the revelation of a moral imperative that is itself profoundly political." cigarette smoking politics."

Mister?�۝ a young woman asks Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) and it�۪s a question that recurs not always quite so politely throughout the movie that bears Reacher�۪s name. He may be an elusive individual with a sketchy background ��� ex-military no fixed address a single shirt to his name ��� but as an archetype he is easy enough to recognize. He is a cousin of Shane and Caine (from the old ���Kung Fu�۝ television series) and Clint Eastwood�۪s Man With No Name: a paladin without portfolio who travels from town to town dispensing righteous violence and hard-boiled aphorisms." �۝ Reacher says wearily at one point though he could say it at just about any point." fantasy figures who dispense rough justice when civic institutions fail. Part comic-book superhero part Old West vigilante and wholly preposterous Reacher is far less enigmatic than he or anyone else in the movie thinks he is. And also less interesting." �۝ the ninth in Lee Child�۪s series of macho best sellers ���Jack Reacher�۝ brings its hero to Pittsburgh where a sniper has just shot down five innocent people including a nanny accompanying a small child in broad daylight.

Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) hires Reacher anyway possibly because she thinks he might keep her client off death row and possibly because she like every other woman in (and presumably beyond) the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is made weak in the knees by Reacher�۪s off-the-charts sexual magnetism." mainly that her daddy (Richard Jenkins) is the district attorney prosecuting the presumed killer. He and the lead detective on the case (David Oyelowo) are obviously too sure of themselves to be trusted and even before we meet a character known as the Zec (Werner Herzog whose casting raises a brief film-geek frisson) we know that the poor fellow in the coma is a patsy. We also know just because of the kind of guy Jack Reacher is that the body count is sure to rise." shootings and bludgeonings on its way to a climactic not terribly surprising showdown. There is a pretty good car chase and a lot of very bad dialogue. Mr. McQuarrie on his second outing as a director (his screenplays include ���The Usual Suspects�۝ and ���Valkyrie�۝) seems more suited to action scenes than to the ostensibly simpler task of filming people talking. Nearly every conversation is stilted and lame laden with the kind of repartee that might strike you as witty if you had no sense of humor." supercompetent Reacher is a character Mr. Cruise could play in his sleep which is pretty much what he does. Ms. Pike seems a bit more agitated perhaps because she is too refined an actress for the kind of pulpy sincerity the movie requires. She tries very hard to make sense of Helen�۪s emotions and motives which is a hopeless task since the character is an inexplicable collage of empathy ambition and neediness on hand to awaken Reacher�۪s chivalrous impulses and to quiver with confused desire whenever he is in the room." the only real fun in ���Jack Reacher�۝ comes from Mr. Herzog and Robert Duvall called in near the end for some marvelously gratuitous scenery chewing as a gruff former Marine. They enliven the movie�۪s atmosphere of weary brutality for a few moments but they also call attention to the dullness of their dramatic surroundings."

But I want to suggest that the movie�۪s ability to foresee ��� even to welcome ��� a hostile or indifferent response counts in its favor. ���This Is 40�۝ is an intensely at times embarrassingly personal film by a man who has worked hard lucked out and wants to share some of his happiness and its attendant worries with the rest of us. Mr. Apatow is quite literally showing off his lovely wife (that would be Ms. Mann) and their lively talented daughters and if Mr. Rudd is not precisely an alter ego (a description that might equally apply to Adam Sandler Will Ferrell and plenty of other male performers in comedies bearing the Apatow brand) he is at least a plausible place holder. He is nice but not cloying goofy but not dumb smart but not snotty and good-looking in a way that doesn�۪t make the rest of us feel too bad about ourselves." a godfather of neurotic passive-aggressive film comedy once made a movie called ���Defending Your Life.�۝ Mr. Apatow though he has absorbed some of Mr. Brooks�۪s deadpan buried-joke filmmaking style does not share his penchant for anxious introspection. The social milieu of ���This Is 40�۝ is generationally geographically and professionally adjacent to the one explored by Larry David in ���Curb Your Enthusiasm �۝ but any trace of that show�۪s self-lacerating misanthropy has been filtered out of the Southern California air. A gaggle of funny troupers ��� including Melissa McCarthy Jason Segel Chris O�۪Dowd and Lena Dunham ��� shuffles through the picture offering up bursts of shtick but there is more sweetness than cruelty in most of their antics." for all its crude jokes and on-the-money observations of the tastes and consumer habits of aging white Gen X-ers (we still love the Pixies!) ���This Is 40�۝ should not be mistaken for satire. While it makes fun of some of Pete�۪s and Debbie�۪s foibles and blind spots ��� his immaturity her neediness their complementary ways of not listening to each other ��� it declines to treat the characters as types or to treat their behavior as symptomatic." of course is free to take up the slack to despise Pete and Debbie even at the risk of hypocrisy. Look at those two fretting about money with a BMW and a Lexus in the driveway the kids in private school and enough left over for a romantic resort getaway and a lavish catered birthday party." Pete and Debbie support no cause beyond themselves. They are complacent over-entitled and kind of mean. But the film�۪s refusal of the detachment that would make them easy targets for judgment is finally a mark of integrity even generosity. You are brought into a state of intimacy of complicity with characters you may find it difficult to like but who at the same time require constant affirmation of their goodness." or at least good enough. So is the movie. It snuggles up next to you breathes in your face dribbles crumbs on your shirt and laughs at its own jokes. Such proximity makes it easy to notice flaws and there are a lot of loose ends and a few forced conclusions.

2004 killed almost a quarter-million people in 14 countries. The scale and speed of the devastation defy comprehension and no movie could be expected to convey the full measure of the horror. But disaster real and imagined is a staple of the modern cinematic imagination and an event like the tsunami presents itself to an ambitious filmmaker as both a technical challenge and a moral risk." �۝ the second feature from the Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona uses digital imagery meticulous sound design and tried-and-true editing techniques to recreate both the violence of unleashed waters and the desolation that followed their assault on southern Thailand. Much more than Clint Eastwood�۪s ���Hereafter �۝ which used the tsunami as a framing device for one of its tales of supernatural obsession ���The Impossible�۝ plunges the audience into the catastrophe and then immerses us in the panic grief and disorientation of the aftermath." ���The Orphanage �۝ was a horror movie a ghost story whose unusual emotional intensity was grounded in the anxious desperate bond between mother and child. ���The Impossible�۝ is also in its way a horror film with nature as the malevolent force threatening innocent lives. The dramatic emphasis is on the anguish of a mother and her son who survive the waves and are separated from the rest of their family." Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) an English couple living in Japan are flying to Thailand with their three sons for a Christmas vacation at a luxurious beach resort. (The real people whose experiences inform ���The Impossible�۝ were a Spanish family of five on a similar trip.) They are troubled by the usual stresses ��� Henry worries about his job; Maria a doctor who stopped practicing when they moved to Japan wonders if she should go back to work; the boys bicker and whine ��� but they seem to be very nice people having a very good time." Sergio G. S��nchez do not spend much time filling in nuances of character. That job is left to the actors who rise brilliantly to the task of showing the reactions of ordinary people to extreme circumstances. Maria is washed inland along with her oldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) and is badly injured by the time they reach relatively dry land. Her fear exhaustion and ferocious maternal determination dominate the first half of the movie and Ms. Watts moves through these emotional states with instinctive grace and an intensity that is never showy. Mr. Holland meanwhile matures before our eyes navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility. He is a terrific young actor." his antic youthful energy tamed but not entirely suppressed is a very persuasive and touching dad in distress. It is not giving much away to disclose that Henry and the two younger boys Thomas (Samuel Joslin) and Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) also survive; Mr. Bayona is a nimble manipulator of audience feelings but not a sadist. And his emphasis is less on the possibility of death than on the logistics of staying alive and searching for information and help. The sometimes excruciating suspense of ���The Impossible�۝ comes from the efforts of the parents and children to find one another despite geographic displacement a shattered communication system and a chaotic relief effort." and ���The Impossible�۝ shows us through the eyes of one unbelievably lucky family some terrible things including mangled bodies and parents in despair. But as Maria and Henry�۪s ordeal unfolds the film�۪s focus starts to feel distressingly narrow. Virtually everyone shown suffering after the tsunami is a European Australian or American tourist and the fact that the vast majority of the dead injured and displaced were Asian never really registers. At one point Maria and Lucas are cared for by residents of a small village and later they are helped by Thai doctors but these acts of selfless generosity are treated like services to which wealthy Western travelers are entitled. And the terrible effects of the tsunami on the local population are barely acknowledged." nor to scold the director for making this movie instead of another. But there is a troubling complacency and a lack of compassion in ���The Impossible �۝ which is less an examination of mass destruction than the tale of a spoiled holiday. You could also say that it is a movie about the consequences of global inequality but unfortunately only by accident." tactfully handled."

And a subplot in which Dean searches for his father is so perfunctorily dropped into the film it is emotionally weightless." who Kerouac hoped might play Dean in a movie opposite himself as Sal. Other possible candidates include the young Robert De Niro Ed Harris and maybe just maybe Ryan Gosling. But Mr. Hedlund is simply too wholesome a screen presence to play a maniacal rebel." who portrayed Joy Division�۪s Ian Curtis in ���Control �۝ is even more gravely miscast as Sal. In addition to lacking Kerouac�۪s dark movie-star looks he radiates little of the inner fire that crackled through Kerouac�۪s writing." character development and storytelling are secondary to blasts of supercharged writing that is the literary equivalent of jazz improvisation. But because so little of that language is in the film Sal emerges as an earnest passive almost drippy disciple more concerned with gathering material for a novel than with living high in the moment." Old Bull Lee a k a William S. Burroughs (Viggo Mortensen miscast) puts in an appearance. Carlo Marx a k a Allen Ginsberg (Tom Sturridge) is a moist moony poet infatuated with Dean. In the cameo roles of the mistreated women in Dean�۪s life Kristen Stewart smolders with sullen defiant sensuality as she tries to keep up with the boys and Kirsten Dunst reacts to Dean�۪s betrayals with outraged indignation.

She may be embarrassed or unsettled by her mother�۪s illness but when Eva asks what she can do her words sound hollow. ���We�۪ve always coped your mother and I �۝ Georges says maybe to reassure himself as much as a daughter who can feel like a stranger." an alienation that adds an edge into her voice when she talks to Georges and he to her is never explained. Mr. Haneke doesn�۪t put his characters on the couch offering up personalities that can be easily scanned and compartmentalized. As a consequence his characters can be difficult to get a handle on opaque which might be frustrating if there wasn�۪t so much meaning packed into their everyday conversations and gestures including what they leave unsaid. Early on for instance Anne teases Georges ��� at least she seems to be teasing ��� by calling him a monster. She doesn�۪t explain herself and neither does Mr. Haneke which allows her meaning to reverberate to grow steadily louder until it booms." she gradually goes from bad to worse. Georges tries to care for her by himself but in time is forced to hire nurses. The inevitable is well inevitable. But in this movie it is also consistently surprising because of the clarity of Mr. Haneke�۪s vision. There is a great deal that is difficult to watch here the indignities of a debilitating illness included and the equally harsh pain of witnessing a great love a longtime companion slowly fade away. The moving subtly brilliant performances of Ms. Riva (best known for ���Hiroshima Mon Amour�۝) and Mr. Trintignant (���A Man and a Woman�۝) are a particular gift in this respect. The two are after all at once forever young immortalized in their films and as familiar to us as our grandparents." yet all too often also meaningless. But ���Amour �۝ despite its agonizing subject holds you willingly throughout. A key to understanding why comes at the beginning when you see Georges and Anne at the concert tucked in the audience that�۪s facing forward as if it were looking at the camera or disconcertingly us. It�۪s hard to see them but they�۪re there somewhat center and to the left waiting and then clapping. It�۪s curious this impression that the characters you�۪re watching are in turn watching and even applauding you. The moment can be characterized as an instance of Brechtian estrangement which is meant to break the effects of illusion and awaken an attitude of criticism in the audience. More simply the theater audience directly mirrors the movie audience eroding the nominal distance between them." cruel even and its depiction of suffering a punishing familiar gesture from a director who�۪s long been interested in transforming spectators from simple consumers into critical thinkers. There are certainly arguments to be made about whether movie-watching is ever simple or noncritical. Yet there�۪s another point to be made here namely that all the violence in ���Amour�۝ is crucial to Mr. Haneke�۪s rigorous liberatingly unsentimental worldview one that gazes on death with the same benevolent equanimity as life. All of which is to say: bring hankies. This is a film that will make you weep not only because life ends but also because it blooms." suffering death."

Joyce also insists that they share the same room in motels and disturbs him with her habit of crunching handfuls of M&Ms while in bed.

2008. ���I have said repeatedly �۝ Mr. Obama asserts ���that America doesn�۪t torture.�۝ The three look at the screen without a word and then Ms. Bigelow cuts to a close-up of one Maya (Jessica Chastain). The analyst�۪s face is a blank. This is Mr. Obama continues part of ���an effort to regain America�۪s moral stature in the world.�۝" I suspect why ���Zero Dark Thirty�۝ has stirred up so much controversy before hitting theaters. (It opens in New York and Los Angeles on Wednesday and nationwide on Jan. 11.) Is she stunned by what she hears? Contemptuous? Relieved? Irritated? Indifferent? Maya�۪s face reveals nothing and offers as much explanation as her silence. How viewers interpret this look will depend on them because here and throughout this difficult urgent movie Ms. Bigelow does not fill in the blanks for them. Given that the opening sequences show Maya helping carry out violent cruel interrogations of detainees I read her expression as that of an employee absorbing a new set of marching orders from her next boss ��� orders that drastically reverse her old ones." ���Zero Dark Thirty�۝ tracks the long twisted road to Bin Laden�۪s capture beginning on Sept. 11 and ending a decade later at another conflagration in Abbottabad Pakistan. With a script by Mark Boal who wrote ���The Hurt Locker �۝ Ms. Bigelow�۪s last feature this new movie is a cool outwardly nonpartisan intelligence procedural ��� a detective story of sorts ��� in which a mass murderer is tracked down by people who spend a lot of time staring into computer screens and occasionally working in the field. It is also a wrenchingly sad soul-shaking story about revenge and its moral costs which makes it the most important American fiction movie about Sept. 11 a landmark that would be more impressive if there were more such films to choose from." a spiky loner with next to no back story no friend or family who�۪s more of an ambivalent protagonist than a traditional heroine. She is introduced in the first scene during the interrogation of a prisoner Ammar (Reda Kateb) by another C.I.A. officer Dan (Jason Clarke). Ammar whom Mr. Boal has said is a composite looks as if he has been beaten. ���I own you �۝ Dan says ���you belong to me.�۝ Dan leaves the room with someone wearing a ski mask; this turns out to be Maya who pushes him to continue. He does. During this scene and a second questioning Dan knocks Ammar down subjects him to simulated drowning and forces him inside a horrifyingly small box. The violence is ugly stark almost businesslike and is largely presented without music cues or any obvious filmmaking commentary." though it is the representation of torture ��� and more important the assertion that such abuse produced information that led to Bin Laden ��� that has provoked outrage in some quarters. We are clearly hungry to work through this raw subject. The most difficult scenes occur early and set the grim mood and moral stakes. (Later there are other briefer visions of detainees being treated harshly.) It is hard to imagine anyone watching them without feeling shaken or repulsed. Some of the worst is implied: You see a bruised face not the punch that battered it. You see a man forced into a small box rather than hear his screams inside it. In these early scenes there is also talk ��� threats and pleas." it is because I assume she knows that the viewers for a movie like this one have been following the news for the past decade. They have read the articles books and legal arguments about the C.I.A.�۪s use of what was called ���enhanced interrogation�۝ and that others have condemned as torture. Trusting the audience in this fashion is gutsy and all too rare in a movie released by a major studio. But it is an article of faith in ���Zero Dark Thirty�۝ that viewers are capable of filling in the blanks managing narrative complexity and confronting their complicity. This is unusual territory for American moviegoers habituated to an industry that preaches simplified morality even as it turns torture into entertainment." they linger casting a long dreadful shadow over everything that comes after. The openings of movies are always significant (���Rosebud�۝) and the key to understanding this one is grasping what occurs during its introductory passages. The movie actually begins with a prelude: a brief stretch of black screen accompanied by a disturbing collage of voices from Sept. 11. The first of the two interrogations with Ammar follows immediately after a juxtaposition that asserts a cause and effect relationship between the void of Sept. 11 voices and the lone man strung up in a cell." babbling weeping Ammar insisting that he doesn�۪t know about a coming attack as he is sealed in the box. The final moment is shot from his point of view and what follows is a scene of a terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia. This juxtaposition of the abuse and the massacre suggests in cinematic terms that torture does not save lives. It is only later when Dan and Maya lie to Ammar sit across from him at a table talk to him like a human being and give him food and a cigarette that he offers them a potential lead." Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (Tushaar Mehra). Called a ���needle in a haystack�۝ by one character he becomes the lead that Maya chases over the next eight years and for much of the next hour or so of the movie. Along with her colleagues including the equally tough Jessica (an excellent Jennifer Ehle) Maya unearths good and bad intelligence stumbles into dead ends unearths glimmers of hope. and endures both at a distance and in close frightening proximity further terrorist attacks. She also interrogates suspects sometimes violently (a man slaps a suspect at her command) until the political climate abruptly changes. ���You don�۪t �۝ Dan cautions her ���want to be the last one holding a dog collar when the oversight committee comes.�۝" but one of the movie�۪s most radical unpleasant themes ��� radical because it is so unpleasant especially for an American fiction film ��� is that these are employees doing a job. In reality there were those who objected to the way that detainees were handled. But this isn�۪t a movie about those who protested. This is about those who did not protest who went along and who ��� while searching for a needle in a haystack ��� interrogated detainees deemed ���enemy combatants�۝ in what the former Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld described as ���a war like none other our nation has faced.�۝ The movie shows the dark side of that war. It shows the unspeakable and lets us decide if the death of Bin Laden was worth the price we paid." �۝ Mark Bowden writes in his 2012 book ���The Finish: The Killing of Osama bin Laden �۝ but ���in the first two important steps down the trail that claim crumbles.�۝" ���Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad �۝ Peter L. Bergen asks ���Did coercive interrogations lead to Bin Laden?�۝ Mr. Bergen reasons that ���since we can�۪t run history backward we will never know what conventional interrogation techniques alone might have elicited from�۝ four important prisoners. However unprovable the effectiveness of these interrogations they did take place. To omit them from ���Zero Dark Thirty�۝ would have been a reprehensible act of moral cowardice." which ends with the harrowing siege of Bin Laden�۪s hideaway by the Navy SEALs (played by among others Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt) much of it shot to approximate the queasy weirdly unreal green of night-vision goggles. Ms. Bigelow�۪s direction here is unexpectedly stunning at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It�۪s pitiful really and as the movie heads toward its emphatically nontriumphant finish it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before ��� the pain the suffering and the compromised ideals ��� has led to this."

Never mind that nobody else wants Marco. In the eyes of the law then (and even today to a considerable extent) a foster home or an institution for the disabled was preferable.

the quiet teenager at the center of the American independent movie ���Yelling to the Sky �۝ lives in a small house that seems even smaller when her father is raging through it. As played by the young actress Zo�� Kravitz Sweetness moves through life like a leaf in the wind. She drifts and scatters and at times gets caught underfoot including by a gang of local bullies. Every so often though she faces down a more frightening confusing antagonist her father Gordon (Jason Clarke) a violent drunk whose menace overruns his erratic charm." ���Yelling to the Sky�۝ tells the hard sometimes brutal sometimes tentatively optimistic story of Sweetness a daughter of a white father and an African-American mother Lorene (Yolonda Ross). Along with her older sister Ola (a vivid Antonique Smith) Sweetness and her parents live in a house with peeling paint on a leafy green street in Queens. It could be Anywhere U.S.A. provided it�۪s one of those cities in which people of different hues mingle without overt acrimony. Race matters here as it always does even when it�۪s not the professed topic. But it vibrates in the background like the hum of electricity and tends to be drowned out by noisier class divides school woes and colorblind troubles." unsettling violence that sets an uneasy mood that endures for the run of the movie. Sweetness and another teenager are bicycling on an otherwise peaceful street when a gang descends and grabs the girls knocking them to the ground. It�۪s a confusing scene with bodies thrashing inside the frame partly because the who what and where of the frenzy are as yet unknown." Ola raging and yelling begins beating the man attacking Sweetness climbing on his body to punch him again and again as the crowd surges excitedly around them. When this Fury is finally pulled off the attacker her pregnant belly juts out defiant as a fist." and it�۪s the kind of startling punctuating image that speaks to Ms. Mahoney�۪s strengths in this film. ���Yelling to the Sky�۝ is at once a coming-of-age story and a kitchen-sink drama mostly though it�۪s a mood piece and suggests the influence of filmmakers like Terence Davies and Charles Burnett. Not much happens in story terms but the film swirls with emotions that make it by turns grim and amusing heavy and light obvious and vague." her father drinks to excess and her mother fades into muteness like a woman being erased. She later disappears perhaps to an institution. As for Sweetness she unpersuasively tries to play a bad girl." despite the violence and its threat Sweetness flounders into a sense of self in a movie that can feel as if it�۪s undergoing a similar painful metamorphosis. ���Yelling to the Sky�۝ can be frustrating especially when Sweetness takes up with some mean girls from school. As an outsider wanting in her motivations feel true but Ms. Mahoney�۪s ideas about her and this movie are fuzzier." ugly scene in which Sweetness with unconvincing power beats up a scowling tormentor Latonya played by a fine Gabourey Sidibe the lead from ���Precious.�۝ It�۪s disconcerting to watch Sweetness tiny and light-skinned assaulting Latonya large and dark-skinned partly because it bluntly if inconclusively underscores a crucial color divide that runs through this film like a throbbing vein."

And his ���Lord of the Rings�۝ movies the last of which opened nine years ago remain a mighty modern gesamtkunstwerk a grand Wagnerian blend of pop-culture mythology and digital magic now available for easy endless viewing in your living room." the pseudoscholarly exposition the soaring allegory the punishing length ��� was as much a product of Tolkien�۪s literary sensibility as of Mr. Jackson�۪s commitment to cinematic maximalism. These were three films to rule them all and they conjured an imaginary world of remarkable complexity and coherence. This voyage which takes place 60 years before Frodo�۪s great quest is not nearly as captivating." much of which was written during World War II is a dark monumental epic of Good and Evil in conflict whereas ���The Hobbit �۝ first published in 1937 (and later revised) is a more lighthearted book an adventure story whose comical and fairy-tale elements are very much in the foreground." but over the years Mr. Jackson seems to have shed most of the exuberant gleefully obnoxious whimsy that can be found in early films like ���Meet the Feebles�۝ and ���Dead Alive.�۝ A trace of his impish old spirit survives in some of the creature designs in ���The Hobbit�۝ ��� notably a gelatinous and gigantic Great Goblin and an encampment of cretinous Three-Stooges-like trolls ��� but Tolkien�۪s inventive episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle." not to be pedantic or anything but ���The Hobbit�۝ is just one book and its expansion into three movies feels arbitrary and mercenary. This installment takes Bilbo and his companions led by the exiled dwarf king Thorin (Richard Armitage) son of Thrain through a series of encounters with orcs elves trolls and other beings some scarier or more charming than others. The only character who manages to be a bit of both is the incomparable Gollum once again incarnated by Andy Serkis in what remains an unmatched feat of computer-assisted performance." which takes place in a vast watery subterranean cavern is the one fully enchanted piece of ���An Unexpected Journey.�۝ It�۪s a funny haunting and curiously touching moment that summons the audience to a state of quiet eager attentiveness. Even if you aren�۪t aware of the apocalyptic importance of Gollum�۪s precious ring you feel that a lot is at stake here: Bilbo�۪s life and integrity; Gollum�۪s corroded soul; the fate of Middle-earth itself." of course plenty of shots of noble characters turning their eyes portentously toward the horizon and much talk of honor betrayal and the rightful sovereignty of dwarfs over their dragon-occupied mountain. But it all sounds remarkably hollow perhaps because the post-���Lord of the Rings�۝ decade has seen a flood of lavish and self-serious fantasy-movie franchises. We have heard so many weird proper names intoned in made-up tongues witnessed so many embodiments of pure evil rise and fall and seen so many fine British actors in beards and flowing robes that we may be too jaded for ���The Hobbit �۝ in spite of its noble pedigree." which rises to weary belated mediocrity entirely on its own steam. Mr. Jackson has embraced what might be called theme-park-ride cinema the default style of commercially anxious creatively impoverished 3-D moviemaking. The action sequences are exercises in empty hectic kineticism with very little sense of peril or surprise. Characters go hurtling down chutes and crumbling mountainsides or else exert themselves in chaotic battles with masses of roaring rampaging pixels." though it is not clear how much Mr. Jackson really tries. (���Giants! Stone giants!�۝ someone cries and a couple of mountains dutifully slug it out.) When the initial rush of a chase or a skirmish dissipates you are left with the slightly ripped-off feeling of having been here before but with different costumes in a ���Pirates of the Caribbean�۝ movie or ���Clash of the Titans.�۝" when giant birds arrive to pull ���The Hobbit�۝ out of the squall and muck of tedious combat your pleasure at this soaring aerial tour of New Zealand may be accompanied by a shrug of recognition since the flight plan retraces the routes of ���Avatar�۝ and ���How to Train Your Dragon.�۝" 48-frames-per-second format which brings the images to an almost hallucinatory level of clarity. This is most impressive and also most jarring at the beginning when a jolly dwarf invasion of Bilbo�۪s home turns into a riot of gluttonous garden gnomes." though the shiny hyper-reality robs Middle-earth of some of its misty archaic atmosphere turning it into a gaudy high-definition tourist attraction. But of course it will soon be overrun with eager travelers many of whom are likely to find the journey less of an adventure than they had expected."

Her manager favors the Latina workers or so she believes; worse her young son Georgie (Austin Wayne West) has been taken away from her.

It�۪s a snapshot of the American dream that seems out of her reach and that will bring her and the second girl trouble." sustaining pocket of green. The director David Riker working from his own script sets up ���The Girl�۝ nicely. There are early flickers of drama mostly from a social services worker who checks in on Ashley as well as from talk about a court decision that might reunite her with Georgie. Ashley looks and talks angry yet even with her periodic outbursts ��� she yells at Georgie�۪s caretaker that only money separates her from her son ��� there�۪s something amorphous about her rage. There�۪s next to no urgency to her demeanor and despite the loss of her son not a lot that feels worryingly at stake." as Mr. Riker suggests that would force her to face tough self-truths. Yet while he makes it clear that she bears some responsibility for her situation he fills in the bleak contours of her world better than he does those of her interior landscape. This limits Ashley who despite her frowns has none of the hard edges that poverty can bring none of its scars. She often registers as more petulant than wounded almost spoiled and also a bit blank. When her father Tommy (Will Patton) visiting from Nuevo Laredo Mexico swings by laughing like a hyena and splashing booze he gives the movie a jolt." she tries to do the same. Her efforts go calamitously wrong and she ends up in Mexico caring for a girl Rosa (Maritza Santiago Hern��ndez) who has been separated from her mother. Rosa wants her mom and Ashley wants to go home and while Ashley resists Rosa her resistance isn�۪t convincing or long lived. Ms. Cornish is a sympathetic presence and she turns down her mouth a lot here but her character�۪s hardness is a thin coat of lacquer and it chips off fast. What at first came across as a tale of dawning conscience increasingly starts to feel rigged." Nuevo Laredo is one of the busiest borders on the continent; it has also unsurprisingly endured horrifying violence over the past decade. In May the corpses of 23 men and women presumed victims of gang warfare were found in the city some without heads others hanging from a bridge. Ashley�۪s father may have moved to Nuevo Laredo (another city plays the role here) because of his illegal pursuits but his cavalier demeanor when he walks its streets and drinks in its bars rings as false as his smuggling. It�۪s even harder to buy that Ashley would even with her hard-luck back story enter into human trafficking with all the furrowed-brow gravity of a woman buying a new pair of huaraches." on screen and off and her impulsiveness isn�۪t beyond the bounds of storytelling reason. The larger problem is that Mr. Riker wants to have his social realism and his sentimental uplift too. The shadowy Mexican streets and the desperate people Ashley�۪s bitterness and ghastly carelessness with other people�۪s lives pull the movie in a direction that evokes the films of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (���The Son�۝) with their stories of moral awakenings. The ease with which Ashley surmounts her terrible choices ��� as well as her voyage deeper into a Mexico where a saint hands out opportune absolution ��� regrettably tugs the movie elsewhere.

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/movies/consuming-spirits-an-animated-film-by-chris-sullivan.html
�۝ an animated feature by Chris Sullivan is a defiant ��� or maybe even better an oblivious ��� exception to the rules and patterns of contemporary cartoon entertainment. At a time when animation is expected to be computer-generated three-dimensional and relentlessly upbeat Mr. Sullivan�۪s film is flat handmade and melancholy a dark and painful fantasy for grown-ups." but ���Consuming Spirits�۝ is so much more than that. The product of 15 years of labor ��� undertaken by Mr. Sullivan in collaboration with his friends and members of his family using paper ink and a 16-millimeter camera ��� it is a work of obsessive artisanal discipline and unfettered artistic vision. You have never seen anything like it." and not recently. This achingly sad occasionally grotesque story of family secrets sexual longings and small-town malaise told through drawings paper cutouts and miniature models has more in common with intimate graphic novels like David Small�۪s ���Stitches�۝ or Alison Bechdel�۪s ���Fun Home�۝ than with any live-action indie melodrama I can think of. The wintry northern class-divided setting might resonate with readers of Joyce Carol Oates. But the blend of narrative quasi-realism and wild somber visual invention in ���Consuming Spirits�۝ is entirely original." you are introduced to the three principal characters whose vividly ugly faces gangly bodies and dry weary voices are likely to haunt you long after the movie is over. Earl Gray (voiced by Robert Levy) is an elderly late-night radio host who dispenses highly detailed vaguely metaphorical gardening advice to insomniacs. Gentian Violet (Nancy Andrews) lives with her aged mother and lays out pages at a newspaper. She pursues a desultory workplace romance with Victor Blue a broken-down fellow continually in trouble with his boss for his surreally inappropriate picture and caption choices." Victor who speaks in Mr. Sullivan�۪s voice is something of an alter ego for the filmmaker a skilled illustrator and cultural omnivore who decorates his imaginary provincial landscape with odd little jokes and allusions. One that caught my eye was an advertisement for Falconetti�۪s Barbecue a grisly bit of cinephile humor referring to Maria Falconetti who played Joan of Arc in Carl Dreyer�۪s 1928 silent film. But nearly every frame in ���Consuming Spirits�۝ ��� and there are more than 230 000 of them ��� seems to contain a similar morsel of oblique or buried wit." Earl and Victor converge in a car accident that gravely injures a nun and that seems at first to fall into the ���random senseless�۝ category. But nothing in Mr. Sullivan�۪s universe is random and subsequent chapters reveal a tangle of dark meanings under the surface." since part of the pleasure of ���Consuming Spirits�۝ lies in marveling at the intricacies of its design. We travel from the colorful cluttered daily reality of the characters into realms of memory and fantasy most of them rendered in spare and beautiful black-and-white line drawings. The past encroaches on the present and the consequences of half-forgotten transgressions play out in surprising but nonetheless curiously logical ways." shrouded in the skin of a deer? Who is locked up in the convent that conveniently and ghoulishly doubles as an insane asylum? And how do actions arising from family love or neighborly charity cause so much damage and grief?" which conducts its inquiry into the darkest zones of the human heart in a spirit at once anguished and playful. Mr. Sullivan�۪s pictorial wit and storytelling brio are delightful in ways that cut against the harshness of the story without blunting its deep ache." ���Consuming Spirits�۝ is both about the power of (figurative) ghosts and the literal effects of drunkenness. It weaves a complicated intoxicating spell and sets the mind running in several directions at once not all of them toward happy places. The fact that these realms are represented in exaggerated often comical pictures does not make them less disturbing but it does create a sense of enchantment that turns bad feelings inside out. This movie is sometimes a downer but it�۪s also a wonder."

Even more than the carefully playlisted HBO series ���Treme �۝ ���Tchoupitoulas�۝ samples the wild variety of New Orleans sounds. You hear hip-hop beats and marching band brass nightclub jazz bands and street musicians playing guitars accordions fiddles saws and their own knees. William receives flute lessons from a woman with angel wings and a feathery halo. Strippers relaxing backstage break into the Mardi Gras staple ���Iko Iko.�۝ The burlesque artist Perle Noire performs with furious athleticism. Drag queens strut drunks stumble in the street and an oyster shucker turns his craft into a form of risqu̩ culinary theater." and at times ���Tchoupitoulas�۝ has the feeling of a tourist-board montage beckoning travelers with visions of nonstop revelry. But the Zanders brothers come from Algiers which is not very far away and the real heart of the movie lies in their capacity to be intrigued by their own hometown and also in their contentious loving rapport." partly because he has a natural philosophical bent and partly because he likes to talk. In voice-overs he muses on his future dreams and prophecies in the Book of Revelation while with his brothers he chatters on about everything from Michael Jackson to the predatory habits of bears. When he is criticized for whining too much ��� not an unfair point ��� William counters that ���girls like men that have feelings.�۝" �۝ Kentrell declares toward the end of their adventure and while that might be overstating it ���Tchoupitoulas�۝ does explore the border between innocence and experience. It is alive with the risk and curiosity of youth and unapologetic in insisting that the pursuit of fun can be a profound and transformative experience."

If it�۪s a god on a skateboard you want a god on a skateboard you�۪ll get in this hagiography which intersperses biographical segments about Mr. Way (including some disorienting re-enactments) with clips from his 2005 jump over the Great Wall of China one of the many oh-no-he-didn�۪t stunts that have cemented his legacy as a technical innovator and a marketer�۪s dream." Mr. Way has an origin story ��� a series of male role models pulled from his life by family circumstance or death each time driving him deeper into his skateboarding. He won contests and eventually helped remake the contests in his high-flying image. But in this overly sympathetic film he�۪s a superhero without feelings curiously bloodless except for the moment just before the China jump when his mother presents him with his stepfather�۪s ashes for inspiration." but mostly this film is shot with yawning reverence with serious talking-head interviews and aerially daring extreme-sports camerawork. The most honest moments come when Mr. Way deems the ramp built by the Chinese to be unsturdy and in the footage of his test run which ends with him flailing across the abyss and being rushed to the hospital. He nailed the real jump of course increasing his own legend and that of the sport." like rough language flirtations with alcohol and drugs and physical injury."

Meandering along with a smattering of multiethnic characters across the African desert the film presents an often sharp commentary on dueling beliefs and idiocies that unfolds in lush pastel hues and distinctively retro drawings." the subsequent adventures of this prattling pet cause the story�۪s initial lightness to congeal into a barely coherent exploration of identity politics and religious coexistence. Though claiming in its publicity notes to be suitable for ages 13 and up this colorful curiosity is more likely to tickle religious scholars than secular teenagers."

a sketchbook of a documentary filled with adolescent bodies groping lurching and skateboarding toward burgeoning adulthood. The movie is the feature directing debut of Jason Tippet and Elizabeth Mims who were in their 20s when they started shooting. The two had recently graduated from the California Institute of the Arts in Southern California when a pair of teenagers Garrison Saenz and Kevin Conway skateboarded up to them and gave the budding filmmakers a subject." which begins abruptly with none of the usual documentary preliminary markers. A boy you come to know as Garrison who was 17 when shooting began is lying on a floor next to a girl Skye Elmore who was 15. The two are looking straight up into the camera that�۪s pointed down at them like a god or hovering parent. They�۪re talking about this or that nothing special. What is memorable is the stillness of the image and how harmoniously their bodies fit inside the frame. Mr. Tippet shot the movie and has a terrific eye and a steady hand and he favors balanced compositions that offset the suboptimal visual quality of the digital imagery." names places and details slip out almost reluctantly mostly though scraps of on-screen text. Mr. Saenz and Mr. Conway live in or around Santa Clarita a valley city of about 200 000 some 20 miles from the San Andreas Fault and 30 miles from Los Angeles. They go to school though it remains out of view as do most of their friends and family. They like to skateboard including off the roof of an abandoned home that they have turned into a playhouse. Sometimes Ms. Elmore stops by for a visit. Once while the three are hanging out Mr. Saenz starts talking about the self-inflicted cuts on Mr. Conway�۪s arm. Mr. Conway teases Mr. Saenz and says it�۪s no big deal." really not much seems like a big deal in this 70-minute movie that slides into idle around the 50-minute mark. With their varying hair colors and styles their chatter about skateboards and God Mr. Saenz Mr. Conway and Ms. Elmore make for pleasant if not especially scintillating company. Unsurprisingly they enjoy talking about themselves and they can be charming and touching. ��But the smallness of that talk and the narrowness of their horizons start to make the movie feel like a very small box instead of a window onto a world. Sometimes that world comes into view ��� a dad in prison a deadbeat mom a lost home. But these mostly float by scenically and they don�۪t stick." though the filmmakers�۪ restricted at times almost parodic image of Santa Clarita ��� here little more than desert abandoned buildings and transmission towers ��� is its own blunt commentary. Otherwise there is no lecturing no overt social agenda no hectoring or softly guiding voice-over and talking-head specialists. There are no familiar documentary lessons. There are just kids being kids living their lives and riding their boards seemingly moment to moment. It�۪s kind of like watching a digital diary. And if Mr. Tippet and Ms. Mims weren�۪t such accomplished visual stylists you might even think that the teenagers shot the documentary themselves which explains both its appeal and its limitations."

It is in essence a coming-of-age story about a young woman learning her way in the world with a few tears but little in the way of risk or anguish." except that the movie is hectic dull and unconvincing. Even when Beth threatens to break up Dink�۪s marriage ��� and even later when she is threatened with the possibility of prison time ��� the dramatic and emotional stakes seem trivial." working from a strenuous script by D.

Alfred Hitchcock as well as Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton have all recently received the keyhole treatment; even Abraham Lincoln helps loosen Mary�۪s corset in the otherwise buttoned-up ���Lincoln.�۝ And in ���Hyde Park on Hudson �۝ filmgoers can watch some presidential pleasuring courtesy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Bill Murray) and his obliging cousin Daisy Suckley (Laura Linney)." and Franklin has taken to driving Daisy around the countryside in a specially designed car that he operates only manually. Daisy will soon have something to occupy her hands because after waving away his security detail Franklin stops the car in a field of purple blooms. It�۪s a pretty scene framed by the bright sky and soft green hills. He takes Daisy�۪s hand and places it on one of his legs but just when you think you are about to see more of the 32nd president of the United States ��� and Mr. Murray ��� than you would like the British director Roger Michell cuts to a long shot of them in the car. The violins surge the flowers bob and alas so does the president." but he and his accomplishments scarcely register in this amorphous bafflingly aimless movie. The story hinges increasingly to its detriment on Daisy a distant cousin to Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor (an amusing Olivia Williams unconvincingly dowdied). In 1922 the real Suckley was plucked from her humdrum life to keep Roosevelt company when he visited his mother�۪s home in Hyde Park which he did regularly. Suckley remained at his side until he died. A cache of papers found after her death in 1991 indicates that they had at the least a sustained flirtation; the movie suggests that these cousins did more than kiss to which you may shrug and say So what?" written by the playwright Richard Nelson doesn�۪t have an answer. Daisy�۪s relationship with Franklin provides the almost somnolent way into the story but it soon becomes part of the background noise for a visit from the king and queen of England (the lively nicely matched Samuel West and Olivia Colman). The visit was part of a larger tour ��� the king was the first British monarch to enter the United States ��� that was intended to stir up support for Britain on the eve of war in the face of recalcitrant American isolationism. It was big news splashed across national headlines as was Eleanor Roosevelt�۪s plan to serve the royals hot dogs a calculated choice intended to help humanize the monarchs for the American public. (The wiener stratagem worked.)" and there�۪s an absorbing intimate scene between the president and the king that could be a coda to ���The King�۪s Speech �۝ the 2010 film about his relationship with his speech therapist. (You have to wonder if Daisy was added in a bid to better distinguish this movie from ���The King�۪s Speech.�۝) Saddled with a role that groans with historical weight yet is also terribly underwritten and underconceptualized Mr. Murray�۪s Franklin rarely comes to palpable life before this encounter. The actor strikes familiar poses the famous cigarette jauntily thrusting. Yet because the movie often assumes Daisy�۪s point of view (she also narrates) his character remains vague remote more of a place holder among the rest of the period-correct production design." yet it�۪s mainly important for what it says about him. That sounds cruel but the film does nothing to right that impression. Did she feel empowered by her access? Turned on? Too bad no one here asks. Forced to creep around the edges Ms. Linney makes a show out of Daisy�۪s awkwardness; to watch her pantomime of a wallflower is to watch an actress struggling to remain true to a character without fading in turn. (Bette Davis would have made this mouse roar.) Daisy�۪s dreariness is so persuasive that whenever Eleanor or Missy (Elizabeth Marvel) another of Franklin�۪s lovers charge in you long to follow them into another film ��� one in which everyone really does live in interesting times." given the film�۪s carefully understated representations of sex and female nudity."

���Deadfall�۝ brings to mind those dark old-fashioned entertainments in rotation on Turner Classic Movies that suck you in with their genre machinery sullen beauties and despair. Mind you this isn�۪t ���Detour �۝ Edgar G. Ulmer�۪s 1945 gutter triumph about a loser a dame and the phone cord that comes between them. ���Deadfall�۝ is a more luxurious item with real locations and second-tier name actors. First among these is Eric Bana as a villain whose menace and honeyed Southern manners suggest that someone here rewatched Robert Mitchum�۪s turn as a charismatic psychopath in Charles Laughton�۪s masterly 1955 fairy tale ���The Night of the Hunter.�۝" but that it evokes both ��� along with a half-dozen other old noirs including those with a western twang ��� points to its satisfying if humble quality. The film opens with Mr. Bana�۪s character Addison on the road and reminiscing in a soothing hush about childhood and a house in a valley. He�۪s talking to his sister Liza (Olivia Wilde) and another man the driver (Dennis Lafond) and while it sounds like a dream his storytelling soon slips into a nightmarish key. Addison and Liza are foundlings of a kind and the image of home as refuge and prison echoes throughout the story. Home is where the heart is and the horror too." the siblings split up and the narrative forks: Addison is plunged into the wilderness and increasingly surreal violence while Liza is scooped out of the cold by a passer-by Jay (Charlie Hunnam) on his way home. By the time the film ends the main characters ��� a web of disappointed parents and unhappy children ��� will have converged in a picturesquely situated farmhouse for one memorably bad Thanksgiving. Before then though the Austrian director Stefan Ruzowitzky working from a script by Zach Dean and shooting in widescreen splashes plenty of red on the white snow. It�۪s a stark chromatic contrast that reinforces the story�۪s divide between the wild and tamed." specific use of his locations. The story is set in northern Michigan (though it was shot in Quebec) close to the border that Addison and Liza are running toward. Mr. Ruzowitzky plays with the eerie beauty of the frozen landscape filling the frame with the uncanny blue winter light and sometimes almost whiting out the image. He can be overly self-conscious in his choices as when he films a snowmobile chase in extreme long shot as if to underscore that his movie shares DNA with the western. It does but the point has already been made. He�۪s on more interesting ground when he plays up the story�۪s fairy-tale quality particularly in an unsettling violent scene with Addison and a family that plays out like a grim (Grimm) reprise of his childhood." Hanna (Kate Mara) with an unkind father Becker (Treat Williams) who�۪s also the sheriff. The relationship echoes that of Jay a boxer and ex-con who�۪s also a disappointment to his father Chet (Kris Kristofferson) the former sheriff. (Sissy Spacek plays Mom.) The stereotypes and coincidences are piled high along with the family baggage. Does it matter? Not really. The pleasures of genre films are often measured in degrees and by clich̩s that have been shifted rather than exploded. When Liza and Jay slow dance at one point you�۪re watching a scene that you�۪ve seen countless times. You�۪re also watching two actors settled into a groove that works partly because it�۪s an assertion of life a passing refuge from inexorable death." sex and more death."

He deduces that Jin-xi cannot possibly be the bumbling bumpkin he pretends to be but must rather be a lost member of the dreaded 72 Demons gang which soon shows up making inquiries of its own." not only because there are a few surprises in store but also because narrative coherence is not really the point of ���Dragon.�۝ Like many other films in its genre it uses an intricate story to explore ethical problems and states of feeling ��� most of them tied to ancient codes of honor loyalty and revenge ��� and above all to stage elaborate brutal action sequences. These are swift gritty bloody and sometimes inventive adding weaponized acupuncture needles and household tools to the regular roster of blades fists and feet." which Mr. Chan uses to pay homage to the wuxia film tradition while updating it with faster editing and digitally assisted gimmicks. The results are sometimes overly busy and the tone of ���Dragon�۝ wavers between knowing pastiche and melodramatic sincerity.

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/movies/the-gatekeepers-documentary-by-israeli-director-dror-moreh.html
�۝ a new documentary by the Israeli director Dror Moreh consists of interviews with six men all of them retired most of them bald one of them a grandfatherly type well into his 80s in suspenders and a plaid shirt. They reminisce about past triumphs and frustrations but Mr. Moreh�۪s amazing upsetting film which opens Monday for a weeklong awards-qualifying run in advance of a wider release next year is the opposite of nostalgic. It is hard to imagine a movie about the Middle East that could be more timely more painfully urgent more challenging to conventional wisdom on all sides of the conflict." the Israeli security agency (also known as Shabak) whose activities and membership are closely held state secrets. Legally established in 1949 under the government of David Ben-Gurion the organization initially focused on internal matters in a fledgling country beset by ideological divisions. Since the 1967 war however the biggest part of Shin Bet�۪s mandate has involved counterterrorism and intelligence gathering in the West Bank and Gaza." in which familiar events are revisited from an unusual and fascinating perspective. The leaders of Shin Bet who answer directly to the prime minister are not part of the country�۪s military command structure. Nor because of the clandestine nature of the agency are they visibly part of the Israeli political establishment though they sometimes function as public scapegoats when politicians make mistakes. What is most astonishing about the interviews Mr. Moreh has recorded is how candid and critical these six spymasters are inflecting their stories with pointed sometimes devastating assessments of the failings of successive governments." after retiring from this job you become a bit of a leftist �۝ says Yaakov Peri who ran Shin Bet from 1988 to 1994 during the first Intifada and the negotiations that led to the Oslo peace accords. But while it is true that Mr. Peri and his colleagues generally favor the curtailment of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict they are hardly doves or bleeding hearts. And their shared professional ethos of ruthless unsentimental pragmatism is precisely what gives such force to their worries about the current state of Israeli politics." Mr. Moreh�۪s interlocutors talk about the ���targeted assassination�۝ of Hamas militants about ���moderate physical pressure�۝ applied (sometimes fatally) to Palestinian prisoners and about the other tactics that are part of the arsenal of occupation. They also confront some significant lapses including the killing of two suspects in a 1984 bus hijacking that led to the resignation of Shin Bet director Avraham Shalom and threatened to bring down the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Later Shin Bet failed to anticipate the outbreak of the first Intifada and was unable to prevent the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing Jewish extremist in 1995." born in Vienna in 1928 and a veteran of the 1948 War of Independence comes across as a wise and gentle old man though he is recalled by others as a bully and monster. He is at once a steadfast defender of Shin Bet�۪s tactics and an eloquent critic of a political leadership which was unable as Labor and Likud traded power and the country lurched from crisis to crisis to summon the strategic vision or the moral courage necessary to bring about a lasting solution to its problems. ���The future is very dark �۝ he concludes lamenting the cruelty and intransigence that he sees as the legacies of more than four decades of occupation." which is perhaps the dominant mood of Mr. Moreh�۪s film. The director somewhat in the manner of Errol Morris is an unseen and mostly unheard inquisitor occasionally shouting a question from outside the frame or prodding his subjects when they seem coy or confused and allowing a series of vivid portraits to emerge. The audience is absorbing a collective history but also coming to know a collection of complicated thoughtful human beings who are willing to share not only their war stories but also their doubts qualms and conflicted emotions." without the usual documentary chorus of opposing views or disinterested experts ��� but also eminently even thrillingly fair-minded. It is guaranteed to trouble any one left right center or head in the sand with confidence or certainly in his or her own opinions. If you need reassurance or grounds for optimism about the Middle East you will not find it here. What you will find is rare welcome and almost unbearable clarity."

Mr. Audiard allows a few glimpses of palm trees beaches and sparkling Mediterranean waters but his greater interest is in the day-to-day blue-collar realities of people like Ali and his sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) a supermarket cashier in whose home Sam and Ali land." �۝ class conscious though it is concerns itself primarily with the social realities of contemporary France.

Stephanie suspects that Ali might be able to help her out of her post-traumatic despair or at least put his physical strength to some use. She is right on both counts but not necessarily in the ways that she Ali or the audience might anticipate." therapeutic fable of healing and in many ways ��� or let�۪s say in hindsight ��� the movie is just that. But its conventional sentimental essence (which is overtly revealed only at the end) is effectively complicated indeed almost undone by the jagged textures of the filmmaking and the naturalistic intensity of the performances. If this is a love story it is also a combat picture in which the principal characters are at war with themselves each other and the cruelty of the world." �۝ a far dreamier depiction of the struggle for dignity and survival in the face of adversity.) Stephanie and Ali are trying to move in the opposite direction to humanize and discipline their wilder impulses. Trying to establish some rules for their increasingly complicated friends-with-benefits relationship Stephanie tells Ali that they must proceed with ���delicacy�۝ ��� ���not like animals.�۝" Ali under the wing of a shaggy crook named Martial (Bouli Lanners) starts fighting in illegal bare-knuckle fights. The unbridled violence of these bouts is exciting to Stephanie." who sometimes seems impatient with the limitations of film as a visual medium. He wants you to smell the sweat and feel the fleshy impact of every moment to climb inside the suffering yearning skins of Ali and Stephanie and feel the things that they do whether they are swimming fighting or having sex." and a reminder that digital cinema is not all about accessorizing wizards monsters and superheroes. But the greater marvel is Ms. Cotillard herself an actress of limitless bravery and supernatural poise who is both beauty and beast. Mr. Schoenaerts is her perfect foil and complement as large and coarse as she is small and delicate and also as tender as she is tough." emotionally replete experience and also a tour de force of directorial button pushing. Mr. Audiard is a canny showman adept at manipulating the audience�۪s feelings and expectations with quick edits and well-chosen songs. (In addition to Bon Iver and Bruce Springsteen ���Rust and Bone�۝ makes surprisingly effective use of Katy Perry�۪s ���Firework.�۝)" instead to acknowledge its power while pointing out some of its limitations. This is in the end the kind of big-hearted boxing movie that has long been a Hollywood staple coupled with a tale of disability that is equally familiar. It�۪s something of a fairy tale in other words but one that casts its spell with a rough raw and sometimes thrillingly ugly magic." fighting killer whales and parental neglect."

not really though details and true stories from the book have been slipped into the mix amid amusing performances historical re-creations and heavily perfumed fertilizer. The book ���Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ���Psycho �۪�ʉ۝ is a fast diverting read that true to its title tracks how the master of suspense sometimes with surprising effort made his influential perverse shocker. ���Hitchcock �۝ by contrast is rather like Norman Bates that nervous pretty boy with mommy issues and a bobbing Adam�۪s apple in that it too takes extravagant liberties with the dead." as if his movies were a direct reflection of his mind soul and deepest darkest desires. To that end it is 1959 and Hitchcock ��� a fine Anthony Hopkins buried in a fat suit and under distracting facial prosthetics ��� is casting about for a new project. He�۪s just come off one of his greatest films ���North by Northwest �۝ which delighted the public and critics a nice upturn after the disappointing reception of another of his supreme achievements ���Vertigo.�۝ (In September after five decades ���Vertigo�۝ bumped ���Citizen Kane�۝ from the No. 1 spot in Sight and Sound�۪s critics�۪ poll of ���the greatest films of all time.�۝)" ���You�۪re the most famous director in the history of the medium but you�۪re 60 years old shouldn�۪t you just quit while you�۪re ahead?�۝ Thus challenged Hitchcock searches for ���something fresh something different.�۝ What he finds is ���Psycho.�۝ Written by Robert Bloch the 1959 novel was inspired by the macabre crimes of Ed Gein the Wisconsin serial killer who decorated his home with human body parts and can be blamed for legions of horror films including ���The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.�۝ (Gein liked to walk around wearing the skin and body parts of his female victims behavior echoed in ���The Silence of the Lambs �۝ in which Mr. Hopkins plays a serial killer who�۪s the ultimate sophisticate.)" �۝ he also becomes possessed by it. As he tries and sometimes struggles to make the movie (the studio isn�۪t keen on the material) the book and increasingly its inspiration take him over disturbing his sleep and invading his dreams. At the same time he is having trouble with his wife Alma (a crisp overglammed Helen Mirren) who�۪s grown grievously unhappy with his fixation on the blondes who populate his work. She finds some refuge in a relationship with a sycophantic screenwriter Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston) whose hovering attention contrasts sharply with Hitchcock�۪s standoffishness. Hitchcock though is apparently a much smaller man without Alma who is at once his adviser crutch and cinematic savior." but also pathologizes it. Fearlessly unsubtle the director Sacha Gervasi working from John J. McLaughlin�۪s script crams the production with bird imagery and shows Hitchcock sneaking peeks at a blonde in a tight gray suit a proxy for Kim Novak�۪s character in ���Vertigo.�۝ The filmmakers even bring Gein (Michael Wincott) into the picture so that he can loom and lurk in the shadows of Hitchcock�۪s imagination. Hitchcock you are meant to believe was himself a little psycho and could only work from a place of madness. His stash of glamour shots of his blondes are the equivalent of Gein�۪s grisly human trophies." apparently was that he was at once a genius and a private man a combination that has allowed some writers and filmmakers to have their insultingly imaginative way with him. The recent HBO exploitation flick ���The Girl �۝ for instance about his relationship with the actress Tippi Hedren painted him as a pathetic sexual predator. (Ms. Hedren has called him deviant and evil.) Although it tiptoes on the dark side ���Hitchcock�۝ takes a lighter more strenuously comic if patronizing approach to the director. The movie has its diversions including Scarlett Johansson�۪s bodacious Janet Leigh and Michael Stuhlbarg�۪s wheedling Lew Wasserman. It�۪s fluff. But while its dim fantasies about Hitchcock and the association of genius with psychosis can be written off as silly they also smack of spiteful jealousy."

Clad in bandanna and shades at all times the stiff bearish Mr. Helnwein plays the production�۪s truth-telling artiste. His eternal theme inspired by the Holocaust is children and their violated innocence. (���How can somebody be so innocent?�۝ he murmurs over a girl in a makeup chair apropos of roughly nothing.)" outsized sets and comic-book costumes were probably a big appeal to this making-of documentary getting made. But the filmmaking does little to bring them to life and doesn�۪t show enough of the opera�۪s action.

very early on April 20 1989 was found in Central Park bound gagged nearly naked and nearly dead her head crushed and shirt soaked in her blood. For years she was known only as the Central Park jogger and her assailants were widely thought to be the five black and Latino teenagers 14 to 16 who were arrested in the attack. The directors Ken Burns David McMahon and Sarah Burns argue that the convictions and the years the defendants served for the crime they were later absolved of were a second racially motivated crime." even though what looked like its final chapter was written a decade ago. In 2002 a New York State Supreme Court judge Charles J. Tejada after being presented with a confession and DNA evidence from a murderer and serial rapist Matias Reyes overturned the convictions of the men who became known as the Central Park Five. Antron McCray Kevin Richardson Raymond Santana Kharey Wise and Yusef Salaam had already served sentences of almost 7 to 13 years for the assault when they were exonerated. Their records were wiped clean and they were also presumably liberated from the public stain of what the mayor at the time Edward I. Koch has called ���the crime of the century.�۝" cultural exhumation and a consideration of race in a presumptively postracial America it seeks to set the record straight. Measured in tone and outraged in its argument it is an emotionally stirring at times crushingly depressing cinematic call to witness. It�۪s also frustrating because while it re-examines the assault on the jogger and painstakingly walks you through what happened to the teenagers ��� from their arrest through their absolution ��� it fails to add anything substantively new. If you followed the news the story will be familiar; if you lived in New York in 1989 it may also feel incomplete." it was horrifying. The jogger Trisha Meili (at the time most of the news media didn�۪t identity her) had entered the park on April 19 at around 9 p.m. About 15 minutes later she was attacked. When she was found the assumption was that she would die; instead she was comatose for several weeks. (When she woke she had no memory of the attack.) As Ms. Burns writes in ���The Central Park Five �۝ her 2011 book the five teenagers had also been in the park that night with a gang of about 30 kids who went after eight people some violently. Each of the five said that he hadn�۪t participated in the rampage and yet after they were arrested for attacking Ms. Meili most confessed to assaulting her. The confessions sealed their downfall." plagued by crime and reeling from the decimating shocks of a bad economy AIDS crack and racial explosions. Combatants innocents and smaller battlegrounds flash by (Howard Beach Bernhard H. Goetz) like the rapidly turned pages of a history book. The five teenagers were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were also the wrong color and the right suspects; the jogger was the perfect color and the right victim. The teenagers might have been up to ���mischief �۝ as one of the movie�۪s interviewees blandly puts it but they were effectively sacrificed on the altar of public opinion." yet the movie would be a lot stronger if it included everything that was in play back in 1989. Because the one thing that it fails to do persuasively is explain why so many people in New York including African-Americans and professional skeptics writing in left-leaning publications like The Village Voice almost immediately accepted that the teenagers were guilty and believed the police with whom these same skeptics had often been often politically at odds. As the filmmakers accurately depict the teenagers were soon demonized and dehumanized accused of being members of a ���wolf pack�۝ that went ���wilding�۝ like animals. To judge from the documentary you might think that it was mostly the agenda-driven tabloids that lobbed these descriptions." in a special section on the April assault that was published by The Voice a few weeks later one of the best articles by Wayne Barrett included the word ���pack�۝ in a headline. But Mr. Barrett emphasized what the police had or had not done the night of April 19 not what the teenagers might have done. In that same issue The Voice printed an investigation by Barry Michael Cooper that quoted residents of a housing complex across from Schomburg Plaza who identified several of the accused teenagers as belonging to a group of sometimes violent neighborhood troublemakers. Some of the accusations involved the usual kid stuff like making noise but there were also brutal attacks. A lengthy New York magazine cover article several months later also detailed violence." you probably read about both these earlier park assaults and the ones around Schomburg Plaza. You knew that the unfolding story and New York were more complex than any tabloid headline. You knew life was shaped by race (as it always is) but also by class and by sex. And you also knew that the fears that gripped so many were not necessarily hysterical but grounded in lived sometimes terrifying experience. That does not justify what happened but it is part of why it happened." as laid out in the movie overwhelming solid and seemingly incontrovertible. It was also overwhelming solid and seemingly incontrovertible in 2002 when the convictions were voided. According to news accounts it took Judge Tejada about five minutes to make his ruling. The police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly disputed that Mr. Reyes acted alone; unsurprisingly the police and prosecutors don�۪t appear in the movie. The next year the men once known as the Central Park wolf pack filed a lawsuit against New York and the prosecutors and police who aided in the men�۪s conviction when they were teenagers. The lawsuit as the filmmakers remind us in the movie�۪s final stretch remains unresolved. The city in turn is trying to subpoena outtakes from the documentary to defend itself."

As Spokane is painted red with Communist posters and patriot blood Jed Matt and some others escape. First they freak out and then they rise up.

the younger son of an Indian zoo owner survives a terrible shipwreck during a storm in the Pacific Ocean. That much you know from the very first scenes of ���Life of Pi �۝ Ang Lee�۪s 3-D film adaptation of the wildly popular arguably readable novel by Yann Martel. A middle-aged Pi (the reliably engaging Irrfan Khan) tells the tale of his earlier life to a wide-eyed Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall) so we know that he made it through whatever ordeal we are about to witness." whose life is so besotted by wonder that those in the audience who do not share his slack-jawed piety might think that something is wrong with him or themselves." a serene and picturesque city in South India. His childhood unfolds in this colorful setting beautifully filmed by Claudio Miranda inflected with a hint of exoticism by Mychael Danna�۪s score and graced with the presence of a handful of excellent Indian actors notably Adil Hussain and Tabu as Pi�۪s parents." professorial man he will grow into ��� is dominated by religion. Pi�۪s story the Canadian writer is told ���will make you believe in God �۝ and Pi himself is infused with a godliness that knows no doctrinal limits." �۝ he recalls and at a tender age he began collecting heroes from other faiths an all-around holiness fan reluctant to declare a rooting interest in any particular team. He likes them all. After receiving a quick pr̩cis of the Gospels from a kindly priest Pi offers up a prayer that summarizes his amiable inclusive approach to the notoriously divisive subject of theology: ���Thank you Vishnu for introducing me to Christ.�۝" it seems can be resolved with a smile and a hushed reverent tone of voice." you will end up not believing in anything at all �۝ warns Pi�۪s dad who is committed to the supremacy of reason and who is as rationalists often are in the imaginations of the devout a bit of a grouch about it. But this piece of skeptical paternal wisdom identifies a serious flaw in ���Life of Pi �۝ which embraces religion without quite taking it seriously and is simultaneously about everything and very little indeed. Instead of awe it gives us ���awww how sweet.�۝" and thank the divinity of your choice for that. Or rather thank Mr. Lee and the gods of digital imagery who conjure up a beast ��� named Richard Parker for mildly amusing reasons ��� of almost miraculous vividness. His eyes his fur the rippling of his muscles and the skeleton beneath his skin all of it is so perfectly rendered that you will swear that Richard Parker is real." �۝ albeit one that is explored with the same glibness that characterizes the film�۪s pursuit of spiritual questions. But Mr. Lee and his screenwriter David Magee have the good sense to put all of that aside for a while and focus on the young man the tiger and the deep blue sea." likable presence with an emotional expressiveness that makes him good company and sufficient humility to not mind being upstaged by a computer-generated kitty. Tales of lonely survival have a durable almost primal appeal and the middle section of ���Life of Pi�۝ confidently clears a space for itself alongside ���Robinson Crusoe�۝ and Robert Zemeckis�۪s ���Cast Away.�۝" and the problems Pi must solve form the dramatic heart of the film. How will he secure food and clean water? How will he stay sane and hopeful? How will he avoid turning into Richard Parker�۪s dinner?" and with only occasional moments of god-bothering. Unlike just about every other cartoon animal you can think of Richard Parker despite his name is never anthropomorphized never pulled out of his essentially predatory nature. The relationship that develops between him and Pi is therefore a complicated one involving fear and competition as well as (on Pi�۪s end at least) compassion and love." and a reminder that the eclectic Mr. Lee is among other things an exuberant and inventive visual artist. (In this respect it is an apt companion to ���Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon �۝ speaking of tigers.) There are images in ���Life of Pi�۝ that are so beautiful so surprising so right that I hesitate to describe them. Suffice it to say that the simple elemental facts of sky sea and animal life are captured with sweetness and sublimity." as I have suggested is that the narrative frame that surrounds these lovely pictures complicates and undermines them. The novelist and the older Pi are eager to impose interpretations on the tale of the boy and the beast but also committed to keeping those interpretations as vague and general as possible. And also more disturbingly to repress the darker implications of the story as if the presence of cruelty and senseless death might be too much for anyone to handle." but insisting on the benevolence of the universe in the way that ���Life of Pi�۝ does can feel more like a result of delusion or deceit than of earnest devotion. The movie invites you to believe in all kinds of marvelous things but it also may cause you to doubt what you see with your own eyes ��� or even to wonder if in the end you have seen anything at all." mostly bloodless inflicted by and upon digital animals."

I got a tough dose of reality from my friend Mark. ���There�۪s no such thing as Santa Claus �۝ he told me. ���Santa Claus is really your mother.�۝ Learning this was no great tragedy though it did take me awhile to figure out exactly what he meant. It is every child�۪s prerogative to believe in nonsense and every child�۪s fate to lose at least a portion of that belief." imaginative creatures and the rest of us sentimentalize these cognitive facts by associating them with innocence and wonder." �۝ for example works so hard at celebrating wide eyes and na��ve joy that it comes close to spoiling its own intermittent wonderfulness. Directed by Peter Ramsey and written by David Lindsay-Abaire (and based on a story by William Joyce) ���Rise of the Guardians �۝ like so much animated entertainment these days is by turns silly maudlin and noisy with just enough ingenuity to make you wish it were better." the Sandman and the Tooth Fairy ��� are the guardians of the magical state of childhood. They are a jolly bunch well voiced (except for the silent Sandman) by a squad of showboating actors. As Santa (he�۪s called North) Alec Baldwin for some reason adopts a Russian accent. Hugh Jackman gives the Easter Bunny an exaggerated version of his own native Australian drawl though Isla Fisher who was raised in Australia does not do the same for the Tooth Fairy." boisterous characters are frequently upstaged by their minions ��� Santa�۪s dim elves and hard-working yetis; the Fairy�۪s hummingbirdlike helpers; the Bunny�۪s footed faceless eggs ��� who provide ���Rise of the Guardians�۝ with much of its visual whimsy. The busy 3-D animation relies a bit too much on madcap flight sequences and vast vaulted spaces but the character design has real warmth and the animation is frequently witty and sometimes mesmerizing." better known as the Boogeyman who is making a comeback after a long period of neglect. He threatens to wipe out the guardians by replacing the happy fantasies they represent with fear and anxiety. Attended by terrifying horses (literal nightmares) he replaces the Sandman�۪s shimmering dreams with dark sooty visions. His plan is to scare the children of the world out of their faith in Santa Claus and company." which are symbiotically linked as any Jungian analyst or articulate 9-year-old will tell you. Even some of the guardians themselves have a more ambiguous history than the movie allows. The Sandman embodies the fear of oblivion that accompanies every bedtime and Santa himself has not always been a purely benevolent elf. This version may have ���Naughty�۝ and ���Nice�۝ tattooed on his forearms but you get the feeling that he has phased out the distribution of Christmastime coal." and also on its conflicted hero Jack Frost (Chris Pine) who is recruited as a guardian even though kids these days have no idea who he is. More than a mere nose-nipper he is an exuberant trickster figure a bringer of slips and slides blizzards and snowball fights. He also carries a certain amount of baggage in the form of a haunting (and somewhat confusing) origin story." Tooth Fairy and the rest ��� into superheroes is both clever and obvious. If nothing else ���Rise of the Guardians�۝ is a canny feat of merchandising and a potentially lucrative franchise in the making. It would be childish to believe otherwise."

�۝ the exuberant new movie from David O. Russell does almost everything right. The story tracks the feverish happy sad absurdly funny ups and downs of a head case named Pat Solatano played by a surprisingly effective intensely focused Bradley Cooper just as he returns to his parents�۪ home after eight months in a mental institution. Pat had been put away for a scarily violent crime but now having shed fat and the defense it offered him and feeding on the shiny philosophy of the title instead he feels ready to tackle the world. The world may not be ready." as it�۪s personified by the family and friends zigzagging through the movie fielding jokes confessing fears and tightly holding onto a man who nearly spun into the void ��� is welcoming accepting loving. ���Silver Linings Playbook�۝ is an outright comedy but like Pat it�۪s a bipolar one that swings between passionate highs and intentionally painful lows. When Pat�۪s mother Dolores (a sensational Jacki Weaver) brings him home from the asylum��� briefly accompanied by his pal in kookiness Danny (Chris Tucker) ��� her husband Pat Sr. (a moving Robert De Niro) complains that she didn�۪t tell him about springing their son. Dolores her Kewpie Doll eyes darting with animal panic responds the only way any loving mother and wife could: ���It�۪s all under control.�۝" and not by a long shot at least as far as these characters are concerned. Mr. Russell on the other hand a virtuoso of chaos has supreme command over a movie that regularly feels as if it�۪s teetering on the edge of hysteria in respect to the characters and director both. But Mr. Russell doesn�۪t just choreograph bedlam he also tames it and worrying that it might all go kablooey with one shout too many is one of the pleasures of his work which includes films like the aptly titled ���Flirting With Disaster.�۝ Like a singer who quavers tauntingly thrillingly close to going off-key Mr. Russell never loses control. Watching him pull back from the brink can be a delight." which Mr. Russell has gently bent to his own purposes. In the book Pat was hospitalized for years which knocks him into a heavier potentially more alarming mental-health diagnosis than the guy in the movie who breezes out of a psychiatric facility. Not that the character with Mr. Cooper�۪s Hollywood smile straining maniacally appears or sounds ready for ordinary human contact. Shortly after he returns home Pat immediately takes up the physical and psychological regimen that he created while locked away and believes will win back his estranged wife Nikki (Brea Bee). That she�۪s taken out a restraining order against him is a minor obstacle." the mission that catapults him out of the house and running around the neighborhood wearing a large plastic garbage bag. He wears the bag to sweat off calories but it�۪s also a conspicuous metaphor for a life that has been outwardly trashed. This being a David O. Russell movie it�۪s also a funny sight gag that keeps on giving whether it inspires one of Pat Sr.�۪s double takes or whether Pat is running side by side with ��� and sometimes being chased by ��� a neighbor Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence aching tender lovely). She enters the picture early during an entertainingly inappropriate dinner given by Pat�۪s friend Ronnie (John Ortiz warmly appealing) and his bullying wife Veronica (Julia Stiles nicely chilled) an encounter that deeply unsettles Pat." a heartbreak beauty at once disturbs Pat and gives him fresh purpose. For reasons of her own she convinces him that she can pass a letter from him to Nikki circumventing the law. In return Tiffany wants Pat to become her partner for a dance contest a narrative turn that suggests the movie will soon be careening perilously into whimsy. Instead it deepens beautifully and then it expands. Tiffany and Pat begin rehearsing in the dance studio in the home she has built in her parents�۪ garage practicing moves with a tentative step shuffle step shuffle. She leads and he follows together and apart and through bungled awkward turns they fall into each other�۪s arms and into the larger somewhat wary embrace of those around them." when you have to go there they have to take you in.�۝ Mr. Russell must agree because he has always played with the definition of family pushing at its normative boundaries with humor and tales of incest addiction and insanity. Like almost all his features ���Silver Linings Playbook�۝ features a large cast that seems to grow with each scene. Pat is alone in a room when you first see him in the movie but as he nears the ridiculously wonderful finale he�۪s fighting for space crowded in the frame and being jostled by family and friends in his parents�۪ house where between plot twists and poignant details (his father�۪s worried caress of a good-luck charm his mother�۪s anxious cooking) he find his place and a filmmaker�۪s worldview shines." ���Silver Linings Playbook�۝ honks waves and pleads for happiness. Not long into the story Pat angrily tosses out a copy of ���A Farewell to Arms�۝ and rails about Hemingway�۪s sucker-punch finale. The world Pat yells ��� at his parents the neighbors us ��� is hard enough. It�۪s both comical and somewhat pitiful but it also feels like an authorial declaration because it dovetails with Mr. Russell�۪s belief in joyous transporting cinema. It�۪s no wonder that Tiffany shows Pat a clip from ���Singin�۪ in the Rain �۝ that blast of pure euphoria. Happy endings used to be de rigueur in American movies and while they often still are the feelings accompanying them tend to feel as canned as Katherine Heigl�۪s laughter maybe because filmmakers no longer buy them or think that we don�۪t." I like a bleak despairing cry in the dark as much as the next existentially anguished post-film consumer but there is a great deal to be said for delivering the bad news on screen with a pratfall. Mr. Russell�۪s affinity for sight gags and the slap and tickle that makes lovers of combatants derives from his affinity for screwball comedy a genre that emerged in the 1930s and that he borrows for his own singular purposes. His movies embrace different problems and character types ��� a strung-out drug addict rather than an alcohol-soaked swell ��� but like the classics of the form they have zippy at times breakneck pacing rapidly fired zingers and physical comedy that taken together reflect the wild unpredictability of the greater world." of course but it too is racked by pain and worry and there are lost jobs and pensions amid its hiccupping laughter. For all its high-flying zaniness the movie has the sting of life and its humor feels dredged up from the same dark boggy place from which Samuel Beckett extracted his yuks. ���Silver Linings Playbook�۝ is crammed with people talking and shouting and weeping and also yielding to what are sometimes called boundary issues but which here turn out to be the mad loving scrambling of people finding and saving one another. These are characters who get in one another�۪s faces and occasionally punch a loved one right in the kisser. They must go on they can�۪t go on but together they do." prescription drugs institutionalization and a violent graphically bloody beating."

but every successful literary adaptation succeeds in its own way. The bad ones ��� or let�۪s just say the average ones to spare the feelings of hard-working wig makers and dialect coaches ��� are undone by humility by anxious obeisance to the cultural prestige of literature. The good ones succeed through hubris through the arrogant assumption that a great novel is not a sacred artifact but rather a lump of interesting material to be shaped according to the filmmaker�۪s will." just cautious and responsible.

As it glides among its many characters reading their thoughts and dissecting their desires the book becomes a vivid panorama of an entire society you might even say a whole species. ���Anna Karenina�۝ does not take place as movie-trailer voice-overs might say ���in a world�۝ of such and such exotic customs. The book lives in the world in the busy contingent present tense of mid-19th-century Imperial Russia which contained everything Tolstoy knew.

You get the sense that in these bureaucratic offices ministerial meetings and aristocratic households everyday life is a form of theater. To play your part in this intricately hierarchical society you must speak your lines hit your marks know your place and beware of improvisation." energetic and alive. Compressing the important events of Tolstoy�۪s thousand pages  into an impressively swift two hours and change Mr. Wright turns a sweeping epic into a frantic and sublime opera." her hair dyed black her cheekbones veiled and her slender frame encased in gowns that function like satin mood rings. We sometimes talk about characters having arcs but Anna Karenina is more like a human wave tank rising and falling according to the contradictions of her temperament. The loyal bored wife of a dry virtuous government official (played with heartbreaking tact by Jude Law) Anna travels from St. Petersburg to Moscow to calm a marital storm in the household of her brother Stiva Oblonsky (Matthew Macfadyen) who has been cheating on his wife Dolly (Kelly Macdonald)." though his philandering is also trivial compared to the affair that Anna will pursue with Count Vronsky a young military officer. I assume you know that it ends badly but Mr. Wright�۪s real interest like Tolstoy�۪s is in everything that happens in between Anna�۪s first meeting with Vronsky and her final encounter with the wheels of a train. Aaron Taylor-Johnson with curly blond hair a crisp white uniform and the kind of mustache that would have melted hearts in an Upper West Side singles bar around 1974 turns Vronsky into a pretty impulsive enigma. He has the eyes of a poet but it is hard to shake the suspicion that this would-be romantic hero is at heart a shallow hedonist dominated by his imperious mother (Olivia Williams)." headlong bliss. Their sun-dappled season of sexual ecstasy is followed by recrimination insecurity and punishment. But the Anna-Vronsky folie �� deux is hardly the only story ���Anna Karenina�۝ has to tell. ���Why do they call it love anyway?�۝ Dolly�۪s younger sister Kitty asks in the throes of girlish romantic disappointment.

(���Harry Potter�۝ fans will be pleased to see Domhnall Gleeson the former Bill Weasley in this role.) Levin is widely understood to be Tolstoy�۪s alter ego and his idea of love ��� as the pure ennobling union of souls ��� is an idealistic rebuke to the cynical amorality that festers in the cities. When it visits Levin the film exchanges the trappings of theatricality for a lyrical naturalism inhaling the fresh air of open fields and the homely aromas of a drafty wooden manor house." Karenin�۪s stern morality and Vronsky�۪s immature swooning. And ���Anna Karenina �۝ in spite of the complicated woman at its center is in many ways a study in the varieties of male behavior.

Played by what look like digitally altered tots and an actual flesh-and-blood girl (Mackenzie Foy) Renesmee is the nominal centerpiece for the final movie and its reason for being. As half-human half-vampire and conceived while Bella was still breathing Renesmee turns out to be an instant problem child. Not only does she look as creepy as the baby Brad Pitt in ���The Curious Case of Benjamin Button �۝ she�۪s sprouting as fast as a magical beanstalk and worse yet has attracted the attention of the Volturi a vampire coven in Italy with papal-like authority.

(The first movie raked in more than $700 million internationally and the series has topped $2 billion.) The director Bill Condon however who brought wit beauty and actual filmmaking to Part 1 along with those enormous receipts has nicely cultivated the art of the stall for Part 2. Working from a screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg who adapted all the ���Twilight�۝ books he doesn�۪t have a lot to play with here but he makes do and sometimes better than that largely by turning his cameras into surrogates for the franchise�۪s adoring fans." feathery eyelashes Mr. Condon makes this ���Twilight�۝ an intensely tactile and intimate experience.

This is one movie that should have been shot in 3-D if only to allow the fans to caress the air. The glammed up Ms. Stewart hair flowing and jaw squared finally looks like the star she has become over the course of the series." she also acts kind of dead. Apparently becoming a vampire robs you of the power to put across an emotion persuasively and while Bella looks lovely or at least strikingly styled she�۪s also pretty much a stiff. Mr. Pattinson by contrast has rarely appeared more relaxed and his character has never seemed more well human. You have a lot of time to look at their faces to examine their micro-movements the cut of their clothes the curl of their hair ��� and also idly to wonder what was going on between these two tabloid favorites during production ��� because beyond a quick hunt and an alfresco nosh not much happens during the initial narratively thin stretch." gathered around the piano with frozen aristocratic languor grows tedious.

�۝ the first feature written and directed by Matt Ross is an impressively executed acting exercise for Chris Messina and Marin Ireland. Playing an unnamed couple whose long-running clandestine affair begins with a one-night stand after they meet in a hotel bar these attractive actors spend much of the movie unclothed as they explore the shifting dynamics of a relationship that exists in a bubble. In movie-pitch language it might be described as ���Same Time Next Year�۝ meets ���Up in the Air�۝ but with a French twist. That twist has to do with the film�۪s mood and austere visual style." some of which last seconds are the room numbers of the hotels on both coasts in which they periodically rendezvous.

a vertiginous drama and the very stuff of cinema ��� played at the Cannes Film Festival this year it would have been hailed as a thrilling discovery. That surely will be the response of filmgoers lucky enough to see this 1967 masterwork from the Japanese director Shohei Imamura (1926-2006) which begins a weeklong run on Thursday in Manhattan at the Anthology Film Archives before moving elsewhere. Seemingly banal in its conceit wildly startling in its execution it tracks a film crew that like a detective squad investigates what became of an ordinary man." though it eventually becomes evident that Imamura was also chasing other questions. There�۪s a no-nonsense cut-to-the-chase quality to the opening scenes which lay out the stakes and terrain. Shot in black and white it begins with a man who after a stroll through a Kafka-esque maze of filing cabinets reads from a missing-persons report. Oshima ��� a salesman 32 with a medium build square face and caterpillar brows ��� was reported missing in April 1965 having disappeared ���motive and cause unknown.�۝ The movie then jumps to a crowded street scene and a male voice presumably that of Imamura asks ���Where can anyone missing be in such a small country?�۝" his culture and his country. The first revelation or crack in the case as it were comes from co-workers and relatives who explain that Oshima embezzled money from his company. Instead of firing him his boss says the company docked his pay. The film then takes a surprising turn when one of the apparent interviewers in the scene a woman Yoshie Hayakawa explains that having just dated Oshima briefly she may have known only his good side. What she asks the boss is his opinion of Oshima? The answer (���timid and gentle�۝) isn�۪t critical but the revelation that she is the missing man�۪s fianc̩e is a jolt because it goes against the grain of documentary objectivity." ���How do you feel? �۝ you may think he should ask you the same question. Because this is a documentary ��� isn�۪t it? That at any rate seems to be the case to judge from the starkly beautiful hand-held cinematography the naturalism of the interview subjects the snatches of on-screen text and the escalating number of images of men holding movie cameras tape recorders and microphones. All suggest that this is a slice of life. A scene of the second interviewer talking to the fianc̩e while they walk together side by side in long shot even brings to mind ���Chronicle of a Summer �۝ the 1960 classic by Edgar Morin and Jean Rouch that introduced the term cin̩ma v̩rit̩ (truth cinema)." Rouch said ���to reveal with doubts a fictional part of all of us which for me is the most real part of an individual.�۝ Imamura might have agreed. As the search for Oshima extends to those who scarcely seem to know him ��� the location shifting from perfectly framed cramped interiors to dense city scenes and expansive country landscapes ��� ���A Man Vanishes�۝ kinks this way and that growing knottier and more fascinating. Each interviewee has an (often unflattering) take on Oshima�۪s character temperament actions and motivations yet the more he or she talks the blurrier his portrait becomes as anecdote leads to digression leads to a discourse on the Japanese character. In a dazzling complicating stroke Imamura also interviews people about some of the other interviewees." including Imamura�۪s proves conditional often contradictory and finally as enigmatic as the photo of him that opens the film. Whether these representations come close to the truth of the man ��� much less that of those claiming to know him ��� haunts the film as do questions of cinematic realism and how the camera changes everything. Years after Imamura made ���A Man Vanishes�۝ he said that he came away ���feeling that fiction ��� no matter how close to reality ��� could never be as truthful as unmediated documentary.�۝ Think about that observation when someone kicks down a wall in the film destroying a set and a host of assumptions with it."

Along the way there are sideline gigs as a busker a fishmonger and a waiter. Once the film catches us up a fresh complication arises when a sassy young intern from a TV show Akira (Anushka Sharma) gets hooked on Samar while shooting a documentary on his work." the magic of Bollywood is that this story�۪s muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties.

In 1963 Orson Welles who knew of the burdens of fame said that Barrymore�۪s Hamlet was the greatest he had seen characterizing it as ���a man of genius who happened to be a prince�۝ and was ���tender and virile and witty and dangerous.�۝ The movies alas only gave us a screen test for that Hamlet." writing in 1940 that Barrymore was ���no broken-down hack�۝ but ���a wit in his own right�۝ who can ���laugh at himself or a play without condescending.�۝ Barrymore had gone Hollywood making his first film in the teens but he remained a superb actor. His older brother Lionel was the first to make the leap from stage to screen and John and their sister Ethel soon followed. It took John a while to find his way in movies and one of his earliest successes is the 1920 version of ���Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde �۝ for which he metamorphosed from man to monster with minimal makeup a threatening chin and crazy eyes. Films like ���Grand Hotel �۝ ���Dinner at Eight�۝ and ���Twentieth Century�۝ followed." �۝ ��rik Canuel�۪s screen version of the William Luce play. The conceit of the drama that Christopher Plummer first performed at the Stratford Festival in Canada in 1996 ��� it moved to Broadway the next year ��� is an imagined Barrymore comeback. The time is 1942 right before his death and he is struggling to stage ���Richard III �۝ his first Shakespearean triumph. He is a physical wreck though he puts on a surprisingly good and vigorous show as without an audience he staggers about a stage delivering songs limericks innuendoes and reminiscences." but the words never do or rather he never fails them: he grabs at their prose and poetry with force flinging away some caressing others. The words drawn from his biography and some of his roles are fine and even better when Shakespeare is the author. Mr. Plummer stumbles beautifully poignantly and often leering and searching through a haze of memory or with concern edged with panic calling for ���a line a line�۝ much as Richard III calls for a horse. From smile to sneer he captures Barrymore�۪s majesty and grandiloquence recites his triumphs and humiliations. Now 82 he is possibly too old to play even a dissipated Barrymore and the difference in age alters the play�۪s meaning because it is age that has most obviously taken its toll." although it�۪s unlikely he was trying to mask the actor�۪s years. Instead he leans heavily on medium close-ups interspersing the kind of head-and-shoulder shots that are common on television with punctuating long shots of Barrymore portentously alone. The closer shots let you intimately scan Mr. Plummer�۪s face to watch the smiles bloom and fade and the cheeks tremble in rage fear and regret. Occasionally a prompter Frank (John Plumpis who unwisely has been directed to shout his lines at the last row rather than Barrymore) tosses out a line or a reproach and Mr. Canuel folds in archival footage or introduces a dreamlike glimpse of the outside world. This all adds little. The performance is the thing."

the sober and sobering Israeli documentary ���The Law in These Parts�۝ presents a devastating case against the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Investigating the legal system in the occupied territories the film is fundamentally an inquiry into justice. It makes a forceful argument: Justice and the occupation are incompatible." Ra�۪anan Alexandrowicz interviews only the lawyers and judges and generals who helped to create and then refine the laws enforced by the military on a civilian population. Mr. Alexandrowicz a questioning sometimes goading off-screen presence takes the men through case histories (a woman sentenced to prison for giving pita to a rebel fighter in hiding) and larger issues (when are rebel fighters terrorists and when are they soldiers?)." those standards can be conveniently reinterpreted. (The most startling example has to do with establishing settlements on occupied land.)" Mr. Alexandrowicz is self-conscious almost as a matter of principle. ���This is the beginning of a documentary film �۝ he says at the start and he continues to investigate the genre pointing out its manipulations and elisions just as he investigates the men he interviews. It�۪s as if he wanted to prove his honesty by insisting on his dishonesty a strategy that occasionally backfires. When he stops to remind us that he has cut hours out of a particularly damning interview don�۪t we start to wonder what complications have been left on the cutting-room floor?" but Mr. Alexandrowicz doesn�۪t have to. His film makes a persuasive argument: When law is an alibi for power instead of a constraint on it law has been emptied of all meaning."

This isn�۪t nowhere but it�۪s right next door ��� in that part of Southern California known as the San Fernando Valley more commonly called the Valley. A seemingly endless stretch of subdivisions and McMansions the Valley lies far below the rarefied heights of Mulholland Drive that glamorous crest that helps divide the Los Angeles area into distinct swaths economic realities lifestyle choices and states of mind." or so it seems with an open suitcase on her bedroom floor its contents chaotically half-disgorged and no apparent job or prospects. If she�۪s worried she doesn�۪t look it. As she drives around she seems oblivious to the effect she can have on others insulated by those natural armaments called beauty and youth. When she smiles she distills a quality that Henry James evoked in describing Daisy Miller and her ���inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence.�۝" though they are connected across time by their sex as well as by their status as outsiders their innocence and the rigidity of the worlds each navigates. At the risk of forcing the parallel to the breaking point it�۪s safe to say that Jane as an emancipated 21st-century woman has an easier time of it than Daisy did. That said as a 21st-century character in an American movie there was a good chance that Jane would still be shackled by the separate-but-equal narrative imperative that turns every woman into a problem only a man can solve. She has issues but men happily and perhaps debatably given what her profession turns out to be don�۪t number among them." Sean Baker who also edited the movie takes his time introducing Jane and the more intimate details of her life knowing that some of the usual questions would be held in check by the effortlessness with which Ms. Hemingway holds the screen. With her unguarded smile and long long legs tucked into distractingly short shorts Jane brings to mind a newborn giraffe or colt though when she sucks on a straw there�۪s also a hint of the teenage Melanie Griffith�۪s callow temptress in ���Night Moves �۝ Arthur Penn�۪s undersung 1975 masterpiece. ���Starlet�۝ is informed by the New American Cinema but not slavishly imitative of it particularly in respect to its seemingly rootless aimless lead character and the ordinary beauty of her unglamorous world." from a script by Mr. Baker and Chris Bergoch pivots on a pile of cash that Jane finds in an old thermos she buys at a yard sale. After a brief shopping spree ��� she splurges on a pricey manicure for herself and a sparkly halter for her dog ��� she returns to the house where she bought the thermos driven by an unarticulated sense of unease or maybe guilt. There she discovers Sadie (Besedka Johnson) an octogenarian who partly locked away by old age and what comes increasingly to feel like unspoken sorrow seems every bit as isolated as Jane. Whether out of curiosity or an overburdened conscience Jane begins wedging herself into Sadie�۪s life trailing her like a sleuth or stalker." as when Jane follows a startled Sadie to her regular church bingo game that Mr. Baker by turns exploits and smartly reins in. Working with the cinematographer Radium Cheung Mr. Baker initially focuses on what separates his characters only to then bring them into harmonious play in the wide-screen frame which seems to expand as their relationship does. The acuity of his visual style is complemented by his sensitive work with his actresses whose unforced performances deepen the movie�۪s emotional realism. A model Ms. Hemingway (her mother is Mariel Hemingway) has appeared in only a few films and is a spectacular find as is Ms. Johnson a longtime Angeleno making a true piercing screen debut." these strangers turned wary acquaintances. Mr. Baker doesn�۪t give much away about either woman in terms of their histories but as they inch closer to each other the continuities between them gain resonance power. Jane makes a living in front of a camera though it�۪s a while before you learn how and it�۪s easy to imagine that Sadie with her heavy eyeliner and topknot once wanted her shot at stardom. The patina of tawdry glamour that clings to this movie is however something of a diversion and also the point. When Jane first meets Sadie the old woman is outside her house obscured by overgrown foliage and the world�۪s indifference. She�۪s as forgotten as the junk she�۪s trying to sell and blissfully stirringly unaware that she is about to be discovered."

if ever there was one ��� have not done a very good job of representing American democracy. Make-believe movie presidents are usually square-jawed action heroes stoical Solons or ineffectual eggheads blander and more generically appealing than their complicated real-life counterparts who tend to be treated deferentially or ignored entirely unless they are named Richard Nixon." an attitude typified by the aw-shucks antipolitics of ���Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.�۝ Hollywood dreams of consensus of happy endings and box office unity but democratic government can present an interminable tale of gridlock compromise and division. The squalor and vigor the glory and corruption of the Republic in action have all too rarely made it onto the big screen." of course and one of them is Steven Spielberg�۪s splendid ���Lincoln �۝ which is strictly speaking about a president trying to scare up votes to get a bill passed in Congress. It is of course about a lot more than that but let�۪s stick to the basics for now. To say that this is among the finest films ever made about American politics may be to congratulate it for clearing a fairly low bar. Some of the movie�۪s virtues are at first glance modest ones like those of its hero who is pleased to present himself as a simple backwoods lawyer even as his folksy mannerisms mask a formidable and cunning political mind." kinetic beginning ��� a scene of muddy hand-to-hand combat that evokes the opening of ���Saving Private Ryan�۝��� ���Lincoln�۝ settles down into what looks like the familiar pageantry and speechifying of costume drama. A flock of first-rate character actors parades by in the heavy woolen plumage of the past. The smaller plainer America of the mid-19th century is evoked by the brownish chiaroscuro of Janusz Kaminski�۪s cinematography by the mud brick and wood of Rick Carter�۪s production design and by enough important facial hair to make the young beard farmers of 21st-century Brooklyn weep tears of envy." who eases into a role of epic difficulty as if it were a coat he had been wearing for years. It is both a curiosity and a marvel of modern cinema that this son of an Anglo-Irish poet should have become our leading portrayer of archaic Americans. Hawkeye (in ���Last of the Mohicans�۝) Bill the Butcher (���Gangs of New York�۝) Daniel Plainview (���There Will Be Blood�۝) ��� all are figures who live in the dim borderlands of memory and myth but with his angular frame and craggy features Mr. Day-Lewis turns them into flesh and blood." he gives them voice. His Lincoln speaks in a reedy drawl that provides a notable counterpoint to the bombastic bellowing of some of his allies and adversaries. (John Williams�۪s score echoes this contrast by punctuating passages of orchestral grandeur with homey scraps of fiddle banjo and parlor piano.)" by Tony Kushner is attentive to the idioms of the time without being too showy about it. Lincoln is eloquent in the manner of the self-taught provincial prodigy he was his speech informed by voracious reading and also by the tall tales and dirty jokes he heard growing up in the frontier country of Kentucky and Illinois. He uses words like ���shindee�۝ and ���flib-flub�۝ and likes to regale (and exasperate) his cabinet with homespun parables shaggy dog stories and bits of outhouse humor. His salty native wit is complemented by the clear and lofty lyricism that has come down to us in his great speeches." the Gettysburg Address ��� quoted back to the president by awed Union soldiers on a January night in 1865 ��� and his Second Inaugural Address which he delivered a little more than a month before the end of the Civil War and his own assassination. These are big famous words and momentous events and the task Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Kushner have set themselves is to make this well-known story fresh and surprising. Mr. Day-Lewis for his part must convey both the human particularity and the greatness of a man who is among the most familiar and the most enigmatic of American leaders. We carry him around in our pockets every day and yet we still argue and wonder about who he was." drawn from parts of Doris Kearns Goodwin�۪s 2005 best seller ���Team of Rivals �۝ Lincoln the man is for all his playfulness prone to melancholy and attracted to solitude. He has a tender rapport with his young son Tad (Gulliver McGrath) and a difficult relationship with the boy�۪s older brother Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is furious that his parents have forbidden him to fight for the Union cause." Mary ��� he calls her Molly and she is played with just the right tinge of hysteria by Sally Field ��� is still grieving the loss of another son Willie from illness during the first year of the war and her emotional instability is a constant worry to her husband. These private troubles combine with the strains of a wartime presidency to produce a portrait that is intimate but also decorous drawn with extraordinary sensitivity and insight and focused above all on Lincoln�۪s character as a politician." in other words less a biopic than a political thriller a civics lesson that is energetically staged and alive with moral energy. Lincoln having just won re-election faces a complex predicament. The war has turned in the Union�۪s favor but the Capitol is in some turmoil. Lincoln must contend with a Democratic opposition that reviles him as a dictator (���Abraham Africanus �۝ they call him) and also with a deep factional split within the Republican Party." led by Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) the sharp-tongued chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and an aging lion of the Abolitionist movement demand a vote on a constitutional amendment ending slavery. The conservatives in the party whose gray eminence is Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) are lukewarm at best preferring to push for peace talks with the Confederacy that evade a decisive solution to the problem of slavery." he has to hold his party together and also pick up a handful of votes from lame-duck Democratic congressmen." his secretary of state and wartime consigliere engages three shady characters ��� high-spirited hucksters (played by Tim Blake Nelson John Hawkes and James Spader) who could have stumbled out of the pages of Mark Twain ��� to lure a few susceptible candidates with promises of patronage jobs once they leave the Congress. With others Stevens�۪s arm-twisting proves more effective. The better angels of our nature sometimes need earthly inducements to emerge." �۝ finally lies in its vision of politics as a noble sometimes clumsy dialectic of the exalted and the mundane. Our habit of argument someone said recently is a mark of our liberty and Mr. Kushner whose love of passionate exhaustive disputation is unmatched in the modern theater fills nearly every scene with wonderful maddening talk. Mr. Spielberg�۪s best art often emerges in passages of wordlessness when the images speak for themselves and the way he composes his pictures and cuts between them endow the speeches and debates with emotional force and remind us of what is at stake." once and for all even if it means prolonging the war? The full weight and scale of this dilemma are the central lesson ���Lincoln�۝ asks us to grasp. The film places slavery at the center of the story emphatically countering the revisionist tendency to see some other more abstract thing ��� states�۪ rights Southern culture industrial capitalism ��� as the real cause of the Civil War. Though most of the characters are white (two notable and vital exceptions are Stephen Henderson and Gloria Reuben as the Lincolns�۪ household servants) this is finally a movie about how difficult and costly it has been for the United States to recognize the full and equal humanity of black people." which may be why Mr. Spielberg�۪s much-noted fondness for multiple denouements is in evidence here. There are at least five moments at which the narrative and the themes seem to have arrived at a place of rest. (The most moving for me is a quiet scene when the 13th Amendment is read aloud. I won�۪t give away by whom.) But the movie keeps going building a symphony of tragedy and hope that celebrates Lincoln�۪s great triumph while acknowledging the terror disappointment and other complications to come." represented by great films like D. W. Griffith�۪s ���Birth of a Nation �۝ which glorified the violent disenfranchisement of African-Americans as a heroic second founding and ���Gone With the Wind �۝ with its romantic view of the old South. To paraphrase what Woodrow Wilson said of Griffith Mr. Spielberg writes history with lightning." even though they may occasionally be confused or fidgety. Boredom and confusion are also part of democracy after all. ���Lincoln�۝ is a rough and noble democratic masterpiece ��� an omen perhaps that movies for the people shall not perish from the earth."

�۝ a documentary about one man�۪s quest to photograph the glacier melts that are thought to be linked to global warming is certainly receiving a theatrical run at exactly the right moment. For one thing it opens with footage of a house being washed away by rampaging water." full of stunning images in addition to being timely documents the work of James Balog an environmental photographer who spurred by an assignment from National Geographic became determined to capture a visual representation of climate change. As he tells an audience at one point in the film ���We have a problem of perception because not enough people get it yet.�۝" a process that required overcoming assorted physical and technological hurdles. But the film doesn�۪t just serve up Mr. Balog�۪s amazing and undeniably convincing imagery. It also records his personal struggles as knee problems threaten his ability to hike the difficult terrain to get the shots he wants. (Assistants take over some of the work.) That combination ��� a solitary quest with global implications ��� makes ���Chasing Ice�۝ as watchable as it is important."

deteriorating housing dysfunctional schools and street crime. At a certain point in a city�۪s decline its financial resources are so diminished that life-or-death services like policing and firefighting have to be cut back at the expense of public safety. ���Burn: One Year on the Front Lines of the Battle to Save Detroit�۝ is a compelling study of Engine Company 50 a firehouse on the east side of Detroit doing the best it can under dire circumstances." directed by Tom Putnam and Brenna Sanchez is a group portrait of the company�۪s firefighters who labor valiantly under increasingly stressful conditions. These men (there are no women in sight) constitute a hearty tightly bonded brotherhood. They love their work despite its obvious perils and low pay. A starting firefighter in Detroit we learn earns only $30 000 a year. There have been no raises for 10 years. Most members of the brigade have to supplement their incomes with second jobs." Company 50 struggles to make do with damaged equipment whose parts are sometimes held together by duct tape. A new fire engine would cost upward of $700 000." 000 today from 1.85 million in 1950 abandoned houses some of which have been taken over by squatters serve as targets for arsonists who according to one talking head set fires for three reasons: ���profit revenge and kicks.�۝ The city has 80 000 vacant structures of which only 3 000 are torn down each year. The city�۪s average of 30 fires a day is one of the highest rates in the nation. The movie includes several scenes of infernos being battled inside buildings on the verge of collapse and filmed by cameras attached to the firefighters�۪ helmets." ���Burn�۝ is not a depressing movie. The firefighters interviewed are remarkably resilient men who talk enthusiastically about the adrenaline rush of their work. And the film makes you thankful for members of this macho breed who relish risking their lives to save others." a firefighter for 33 years approaching the age of 60 who recently lost his wife with whom he had expected to spend a long and happy retirement struggles to imagine what�۪s next. Brendan Milewski a recently married 30-year-old firefighter known as Doogie was paralyzed when he was crushed under a brick wall that fell during a blaze. He too fights despair." a native Detroiter who spent 30 years with the Los Angeles Fire Department is Detroit�۪s recently appointed fire commissioner and its first to be recruited from outside the rank and file. Initially viewed with suspicion by the brigade he is a blunt realist about the challenges the company faces. Not all agree with his decision to let certain fires burn once it is determined there are no people living in the structures. But Mr. Austin emerges as sympathetic figure. A scene of him sweeping his own office because there are no funds for janitorial services illustrates how desperate the situation has become. They are all in it together."

the hero of ���The Return of Lencho�۝ says ���I love how subtly you guys explore the theme of globalization in Guatemala.�۝ As pillow talk that may make you giggle but it�۪s meant to be serious and sexy. It also reflects the film�۪s ambition: to be a subtle exploration of contemporary problems in Guatemala." written and directed by Mario Rosales which loosely follows the adventures of Lencho (Mario Lanz) and his pals ��� D.J.�۪s poets rappers graffiti artists. They fight the power in a corrupt still-brutal state while preparing for a festival in an indigenous village and praising one another�۪s work. The police are the villains here though the leering specimens offered up would be more at home on an opera stage than in a movie trying to expose social ills." meanwhile is a kind of populist superman. He�۪s Che Guevara handsome an artist with street style a groovy pothead and an intellectual who reads aloud from tomes about post-colonialism. He�۪s even a movie critic though he abandons reviewing ���Apocalypto �۝ because as he says in different words it stinks. Naturally the ladies love cool Lencho even when he�۪s lecturing them. Still no one loves him as much as Mr. Rosales." ���The Return of Lencho�۝ mixes it up stylewise with flashbacks and interpolated bits of other films and art. But instead of pulsing with freewheeling energy it sags under its earnest polemics."

Todd Rohal would certainly earn it with ���Nature Calls �۝ an unwatchably bad movie about a camping trip gone haywire." a Scout leader who is determined to give his aged frail father the founder of the troop one last trip to the wilderness though none of the boys want to go. Kirk (Johnny Knoxville) Randy�۪s brother is also opposed to the outing but somehow Randy gets the youngsters out into the woods anyway." incoherent editing and general offensiveness of this film since he both wrote and directed. But you�۪d think someone in the experienced cast which includes Rob Riggle Maura Tierney and Darrell Hammond would have told him that the numerous scenes in which adult characters curse in the vilest way in front of young boys would leave the film without an audience. (The boys do some cursing too.) Its jokes won�۪t appeal to anyone older than 8 but a parent who takes a child to this crass mess would be subject to prosecution."

�۝ Donna Kanter�۪s charming documentary about a Hollywood institution more enduring than most sitcoms." but the diners remain constant give or take the odd family or medical event. And though the gathering usually kicks off with health updates ��� the so-called ���organ recital�۝ ��� these guys (and they are all guys) would rather not focus on hip-replacement humor." Ms. Kanter listens while the likes of Sid Caesar Carl Reiner and Gary Owens (the indispensable announcer of ���Rowan & Martin�۪s Laugh-In�۝) nosh and natter. A twinkling Hal Kanter (the director�۪s father who died last year) reflecting on the predominance of Jews in the comedy-writing game reveals a mind as playful as the one that gave us frothy pleasures like ���Move Over Darling�۝ and ���Blue Hawaii.�۝ And though not everyone present is blessed with the director Arthur Hiller�۪s impressive white mane the film�۪s exhibition of vibrant longevity is reason enough to celebrate." ���Lunch�۝ coasts on the earned wisdom of pros who know how to work a room. Right up to the arrival of their separate checks."
