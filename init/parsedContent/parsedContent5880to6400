It is the prelude to a catalog of shady dealings that include his lobbying on behalf of sweatshop owners in the Northern Marianas Islands where clothing manufacturers were allowed to put ���Made in the U.S.A.�۝ tags on items without violating United States labor laws." Mr. Gibney is no match for Bill Moyers whose coverage of the Abramoff scandals on ���Bill Moyers Journal�۝ had a gravity spareness and shape lacking in ���Casino Jack.�۝" but there are no signs that his kind of high-powered lobbying which one talking head describes as ���legalized bribery �۝ is a thing of the past."

�۝ Nicole Holofcener�۪s latest comic drama of spiky manners are ���you�۪re welcome.�۝ They�۪re uttered by Kate a New York malcontent played with complex appeal by the wonderful actress Catherine Keener. Kate�۪s daughter Abby (Sarah Steele) a stridently truculent teenager has in a rare instance of filial generosity just thanked her mother for agreeing to pay for a pricey pair of jeans. From the near-beatific look on Kate�۪s face it seems that after struggling to make amends for some vague unarticulated wrong ��� by doling out cash to homeless people for instance ��� she has found her moment of grace." attractively imperfect and flat-out annoying as does Ms. Holofcener whose features include ���Friends With Money�۝ and ���Lovely & Amazing.�۝  You may  not love them but you recognize their charms and frailties their fears and  hopes. They may remind you of your friends your sisters or even yourself which makes them attractive and sometimes off-putting an unusual complicated mix. We don�۪t necessarily or only go to the movies to see mirror versions of ourselves: we also want (or think we do) better kinder nobler prettier and thinner images idealized types and aspirational figures we can take pleasure in or laugh at  in all their plastic unreality. The female characters in Ms. Holofcener�۪s films don�۪t live in those movies: they watch them." including Kate and her only child the 15-year-old Abby and their irascible next-door neighbor Andra (Ann Guilbert) a nonagenarian with two granddaughters Rebecca (Rebecca Hall) and Mary (Amanda Peet). Kate and her husband Alex (Oliver Platt) expect to take over Andra�۪s apartment when she dies a macabre objective that they compensate for  with strained smiles and by running an occasional errand for her. Kate and Alex also own a store specializing in midcentury Modern furniture lamps and the like which they stock from the apartments of the dead. It stings when a  customer calls them ambulance chasers but there�۪s a touch of  truth to that remark." you can almost understand Kate and Alex�۪s impatience though I don�۪t think that is exactly what Ms. Holofcener had in mind when she gave her characters so many thorns. Kate and Alex want to expand their already spacious Upper West Side apartment a desire that slightly embarrasses them and creates tension particularly during a birthday party that Kate gives for Andra. Mary who comes with so many spikes she could star in a ���Hellraiser�۝ sequel (as Mrs. Pinhead) and has had too much to drink (as is her habit) urges Kate to explain her renovation plans to everyone Andra included. It�۪s an uncomfortable exchange but like too many scenes it also feels rigged for maximum outrage." who works as an X-ray technician taking mammograms. You see her during the opening-credit sequence which features various plopping flopping  breasts being readied for the big squeeze a montage Ms. Holofcener sets to the Roches singing ���No Shoes �۝ with its litany of self-mocking complaints (���I had no shoes and I complained/Until I met a man who had no feet�۝). Ms. Holofcener doesn�۪t overdo the scenes of Rebecca tending to the patients who might soon learn the worst. But the delicacy of Rebecca�۪s touch speaks a great deal about a woman who is also so depressed or repressed or something  that she can�۪t even admit that she wants to see the leaves turn colors in the fall." and their dad soon headed out the door. (Maybe he was running from Andra.) Having been raised by her grandmother Rebecca now buys Andra�۪s groceries and doles out her medications living with Mary in a dreary sterile apartment where they eat microwave dinners and watch television amid sisterly sniping. A sloppy mean drinker with a quiver full of insults Mary works in a spa and spends far too much time browning in a tanning bed ��� she looks like a Creamsicle. Neither sister seems to have any outside friends or initially a love life which strikes a false note until you get to know them." Abby Mary and Andra embody the ages of woman ��� youth adulthood and old age ��� a sort of variation on Gail Sheehy�۪s ���Passages.�۝ But because they�۪re so unmodulated barely saying a kind word among them they become tough to take. (Ms. Peet nonetheless keeps you watching and engaged.) The appeal of Ms. Holofcener�۪s films which are visually unmemorable rests almost entirely in her characters so the lack of shading among these three throws the story off balance.  Rebecca lacks  a similar modulation  until she meets a guy Eugene (Thomas Ian Nicholas). Men might not make women happy here but left to their own devices women tend only to make one another unhappy." the less time you want to spend with them ��� they�۪re so full of complaint that it  feels as if Ms. Holofcener were worried about making them false turning them into movie characters. The exception is Kate because she comes with the most dimensions and is played by Ms. Keener (a Holofcener veteran). No one in American movies does difficult women better than Ms. Keener who�۪s fearless when it comes to nasty cold roles yet resists caricature. (At her most withering she can recall George Sanders.) Her character in ���Please Give�۝ isn�۪t acerbic but Kate has bite along with a lot of underexamined ��� by her and by Ms. Holofcener ��� guilt most of which appears to have something to do with being bourgeois." along with the film�۪s title suggests the scope of Ms. Holofcener�۪s  intentions.  There�۪s so much hurt in the world and Kate wants to help. But she�۪s a rotten volunteer weepy and self-conscious and she doesn�۪t seem to see the pain closer to home. She�۪s the definition of the guilty white (presumed) liberal and might have been a rich source of comedy and pathos. But only if we saw her working through her issues (and her narcissism) with more obvious intelligence and greater self-awareness wrestling more thoughtfully with life the way that  Ms. Holofcener herself has tried to do in this likable if frustrating film. Ms. Holofcener didn�۪t need to come up with answers for Kate ���  the ones in the movie are less than satisfying ��� but it would have been nice if she had let Kate ask  some harder questions."

trailer-ready catchphrases (���Let�۪s play tag: you�۪re it! �۝ ���Fooled you!�۝ and so on) uttered by Freddy Krueger in the newly rebooted ���Nightmare on Elm Street.�۝ But really who apart from Freddy�۪s terrified and bewildered new victims could have forgotten? This maniac with his jaunty hat and striped sweater his ravaged face and murderous bladed glove has been a fixture of pop culture for more than a quarter century." though and after the first ���Nightmare�۝ in 1984 as sequel followed sequel Freddy originally played by Robert Englund became almost lovable in his familiarity a figure of camp affection rather than mortal terror. But that first installment in the franchise directed by Wes Craven and featuring a young and pretty Johnny Depp was a canny and potent exercise in fright." childhood memory and urban legend Freddy represented something authentically scary: the unconscious brought to literal murderous life. That his rampages singled out mostly privileged suburban teenagers ��� kids whose innocence and security is a collective national obsession ��� made them even more frightening." the remade ���Nightmare on Elm Street �۝ directed by Samuel Bayer from a script by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer tries to recapture some of the grisly wit of the original. Freddy is played by Jackie Earle Haley whose career has revived nicely thanks to his skill at playing creeps and maniacs. Freddy shows up in the dreams of a group of high school students who live in the leafy town of Springwood and who don�۪t understand why the same creepy figure menaces them all in their dreams leaving them  afraid to fall asleep." but the deeper ���Nightmare�۝ delves into this sordid back story the less haunting it becomes. Some of the early set pieces ��� the opening sequence in a diner for example or another that unfolds after one of the victims has dozed off in class ��� dispense their shocks inventively but for the most part the movie traffics in overly familiar scare tactics setting up predictable false alarms and telegraphing in advance just when Freddy will pop into the frame and utter one of his labored witticisms." and makes a few of the scenes that should be horrifying look silly. The cast ��� notably Rooney Mara and Kyle Gallner as Freddy�۪s longest-surviving prey ��� are reasonably adept at screaming crying looking sleepy and earnestly delivering expository information they glean from research on the Internet and at the local bookstore." and ���A Nightmare on Elm Street�۝ is sufficiently effective to keep you awake for the duration of its running time. It is unlikely to trouble your slumber afterward though. This movie is an acceptable specimen of a currently popular genre carefully trying to balance the sly humor and low-budget resourcefulness of earlier horror films with the bloodiness and digital showing-off currently in fashion.

�۝  it might have turned out looking and sounding something like ���Mercy �۝ a portrait of a sub-Mailer-like literary pugilist and the woman (named Mercy) who wins his heart. Odd as that juxtaposition may seem it�۪s not a bad mix. The movie directed by Patrick Hoelck and starring Scott Caan who wrote the screenplay and served as one of its producers may be something of a vanity project. (It is his third produced screenplay after ���Dallas 362�۝ and ���The Dog Problem.�۝) But it allows Mr. Caan to deliver a complex portrait of a womanizing bully with a cream-puff heart." Johnny Ryan is a reformed bad boy who in his aimless younger days raised hell and bounced in and out of jail. His life turned around when he (somewhat incongruously) began writing best-selling romance novels that have made him a minor literary star and a supposed expert on love about which he actually knows next to nothing. If he is charismatic he is also borderline insufferable." that block being his father Gerry (James Caan) a writing professor who appears late in the movie. When the father and son get together in Gerry�۪s rural cabin and philosophize about love (Gerry has decided it never lasts) the characters and the actors who are father and son blur into each other." which sounds at least partially improvised is one of those boozy late-night colloquies between men in which little of substance is said and a lot of churning emotion bangs around the room. The younger Caan�۪s physical and vocal resemblance to the youthful Michael Douglas brings to mind Michael and Kirk Douglas�۪s competitive relationship with its volatile blend of machismo Oedipal  tension and sentimentality." women are still the big mystery creatures to be feared avidly desired and conquered. In the movie�۪s several scenes of Johnny flirting the banter and even the eye contact convey a subtext of predatory combat and a certain weariness on the part of the women at having to engage." the beauty to whom Johnny loses his heart wrote the sole negative review of his third novel which he discovers  only after hitting on her at his own book party. Instead of being vengeful he is courtly. A literary dialogue little of which is heard ensues and soon turns into an intense affair with marriage on the horizon." as women often are in movies this male-centric. She is smart and articulate with a British accent but there is no real sense of who she is or what motivates her. She has one  vulnerability:  sudden and severe asthma attacks. The story unfolds in ���before�۝ and ���after�۝ chapters whose meaning  becomes clear only late in the film." photographed to look smudged and nearly colorless is almost another character in a film that cloaks the city in a glum noirish ambiance. That atmosphere reflects the glowering attitude of Johnny�۪s posse of would-be playboys that includes Troy Garity as his best friend and Dylan McDermott as his sullen cynical agent.  They�۪re the boys from ���Entourage �۝ 10 years later at a lower economic level."

The real and perhaps only point  is to watch Mr. Caine play an old dude who mows down a lot of villains which he does  plausibly. He performs  his nasty work with verve not only because he�۪s fired a lot of movie guns but also because he brings the memory of his great roles to every part.

�۝ Anton Chekhov wrote in one of his notebooks. Such a man emerges in ���Anton Chekhov�۪s The Duel �۝ a very satisfying and tonally precise English-language adaptation of an 1891 Chekhov novella. Set in a seaside town in the Caucasus where Europe meets Asia against stark mountain ranges and the blue of the sky as it melts into the darker sea the story turns on a handful of Russians during a sweltering summer. Amid this small world there are moments of comedy dark sentiments invocations of Tolstoy and a generous attitude toward human frailties." a Georgian-born Israeli who made a strong debut with his 2001  ���Late Marriage �۝ about an Israeli man hiding his affair with a divorced mother from his domineering family. Once again Mr. Kosashvili mixes moments of bitterness and laughter with strong dramatic passages creating a social milieu in ���The Duel�۝ that is believably inhabited consistently surprising and true-feeling in detail and sweep. (Its most unattractive feature is that ungainly title.)" Laevsky (Andrew Scott appalling and appealing); his married mistress Nadya (Fiona Glascott a milky beauty); and a zoologist Von Koren (Tobias Menzies suitably rigid). The story gets going with Laevsky bitterly complaining about Nadya to an older friend a doctor Samoylenko (Niall Buggy). Laevsky claims to no longer care for Nadya who having left her husband now inspires her lover�۪s contempt or perhaps fatigue. Like a caged animal he wants out and claws at Samoylenko as Von Koren watches and seethes stoking his loathing for Laevsky.  For his part by cutting to Nadya during Laevsky�۪s rant and capping the scene with a disapproving look from Von Koren Mr. Kosashvili suggests that his own sympathies are divided." �۝ which unhurriedly moves among the players  in scenes that capture a mood or serve as a quick character  sketch or function on both counts as in a brief early interlude in which Laevsky lies stretched across a sofa with a handkerchief over his face seemingly napping. There�۪s a window open near him shedding light into the room and you can almost feel the thick heat of the day a sense of torpor when Laevsky suddenly smacks a nearby table as if decimating a fly. It�۪s a small seemingly inconsequential moment but the juxtaposition of indolence with sudden violence immediately creates a sense of character  that will be borne out in later scenes." rubles that the doctor in turn borrows from Von Koren. The zoologist agrees but only on the condition that Laevsky will send for Nadya. This impossible exchange ��� a promise of freedom and its simultaneous refusal ��� binds the three principals in this mini-drama like a rope which only tightens as the story unfolds. As they�۪re drawn closer together they deepen into unhappier versions of themselves: Von Koren becomes inflexible Laevsky turns hysterical and Nadya grows increasingly desperate. When Von Koren a proponent of Darwin spits out that only the more perfectly developed survive you might wonder how anyone here could." working from Mary Bing�۪s sensitive economic screenplay and with the fine cinematographer Paul Sarossy makes the most of the story�۪s social environment gently underscoring its claustrophobia. Everything including the clothing and the similarly oppressive rooms with their Oriental rugs and heavy furniture creates a sense of human-made entrapment that feels at odds with the surrounding natural world. (Laevsky sweats like the condemned while Von Koren remains arid in body and deed.) Mr. Kosashvili doesn�۪t push his contrasts too hard or overplay the interludes of drama. He observes and moves on as when one character discovers an adulterous liaison a scene that in another movie might be played for melodramatic excess but here is underplayed because the hurt needs no amplification." based on the novella by Anton Chekhov; director of photography Paul Sarossy; edited by Kate Williams; music by Angelo Milli; production designer Ivo Husnjak; costumes by Sergio Ballo; produced by Donald Rosenfeld and Ms. Bing; released by High Line Pictures.

gaudy 42nd Street as the old song had it were probably more than just careless. You wouldn�۪t know it from the musical ���42nd Street �۝ certainly but those ladies  were probably bumping and grinding amid feathery fans and gurgling soap bubbles. In the 1930s Times Square was where professional straight men like Robert Alda (father of Alan) warmed up audiences that strippers put on boil. A popular entertainment stripping was ��� or so the theater owner Herbert Minsky insisted ��� an American art. But in New York and elsewhere burlesque came with a price: a milieu of vice that alarmed religious leaders and business owners and the politicians who catered to them." personified by the glamour-puss likes of Dita Von Teese striptease troupes like the Velvet Hammer (in Los Angeles)  and the transformation of pole-dancing into a mainstream fitness routine (from Tony Soprano�۪s pleasure palace to yours) suggest that the time is ripe for a thoughtful new look at a disreputable old art form. If only ���Behind the Burly Q�۝ were up to the task. A charming uncritical often entertaining jumble the documentary was written and directed by Leslie Zemeckis who produced the movie with Jackie Levine and its director of photography Sheri Hellard.  (Ms. Zemeckis�۪s husband the director Robert Zemeckis has an executive producer credit.)" but you would be hard pressed  to find a coherent chronology here. The movie jumps from woman to woman topic to topic (costumes to mobsters) as it moves across time. If you know what hairstyles were in fashion you might be able to guess the decade. Otherwise you�۪re often on your own. That�۪s unfortunate because the personal stories could use some political balance including a deeper look at why Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York banned burlesque in 1937. That story for the curious is fleshed out in the book ���Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show �۝ by Rachel Shteir one of the movie�۪s talking heads." but the real reasons to see ���Burly Q�۝ are the women who took it all off (or most of it anyway) in cheap joints across the country and the occasional Art Nouveau palace. Among the legends featured in the numerous contemporary interviews ��� as well as the flurry of archival photos and film clips ��� is Kitty West who performed on the half shell as Evangeline the Oyster Girl. Also on hand is Tempest Storm a flaming redhead who advertised as ���the girl with the 40-plus bust who goes 3-D two better �۝ appeared with the pinup queen Bettie Page in the 1955 revue film ���Teaserama.�۝ Now camera shy Blaze Starr meanwhile appears as a voice on a telephone a ghostly presence." the present-day interviews with these women are a delight and also poignant partly because of the contrast between their older and younger selves though mostly because of the lives they lived. Some climbed out of poverty leaving behind sharecropper families to earn a living the only way they felt they could. Some of them talk about the hard times before they entered burlesque; as a rule they are far more discreet about what happened during their stripper days perhaps because many belong to the pre-Oprah generation. Like World War II veterans they can tell a good story but are otherwise pretty close-mouthed when it comes to anything that might smack of complaint." independent women. Despite a few nods at the mob and the calamities of too much booze and a lingering melancholic look at Lili St. Cyr a statuesque blonde who spiraled into tragedy the movie is generally upbeat even giddy an excitable attitude that the chaotic storytelling reinforces. Maybe Ms. Zemeckis wanted to protect the women; you can understand her desire to make sure they were not pathologized. At the same time there is more to this story including what it meant for women to strip for money in the era before women�۪s lib. It�۪s great that she immortalized these women some for the final time. But this is history as nostalgia."

though you have to assume it was not long after filmmakers started hitting the couch or at least cruising the self-help bookshelves. Once upon a studio time romantic comedies involved a man and a woman engaged in delicate (or crude) power negotiations. The shrew had to be tamed and the boy had to grow up so he could handle her or some variation on that idea. That template is still in use though the banter that accompanied those negotiations has given way to speeches about feelings. Freud might have hit Hollywood decades earlier but Woody Allen and the generations of funnymen and women he inspired have a lot to answer for." �۝ a not very good and yet painless waste of time has certainly thought through some life and love questions. Written by Kate Angelo   and directed by Alan Poul the movie is essentially a vehicle for Jennifer Lopez an appealing screen presence with a disappointing big-screen track record. That�۪s probably not all her fault: romantic roles for women often are the provenance of the bland or the blonde (Jennifer Aniston or Katherine Heigl) or the rare professional wisenheimer (Tina Fey). Angelina Jolie has a lock on the tough chick thing something Ms. Lopez proved she could do beautifully in Steven Soderbergh�۪s thriller ���Out of Sight �۝ her best movie to date." �۝ a 2007 release about the salsa musician H̩ctor Lavoe that she made with her husband Marc Anthony. As a consequence ���The Back-Up Plan�۝ isn�۪t just about a single woman Zoe who decides to have a baby on her own. It�۪s also about how good Ms. Lopez looks after a few years off from the movies during which she had twins and then ��� to judge from the many shots of her taut stomach firm thighs and even a peek-a-boo look at her derri̬re ��� got back into shape. If you think that�۪s an overstatement consider that an entire scene involves a pregnant Zoe waxing rueful about her glorious posterior as she brandishes a photo for evidence." though which opens with Zoe being artificially inseminated in a fertility clinic by her jokey doctor (Robert Klein of all people). Terminally single if not really a lonely New York gal Zoe owns a small pet store has a wee disabled dog and two supportive employees (Eric Christian Olsen and Noureen DeWulf) who don�۪t seem to do more than smile indulgently and play the foil much as Eve Arden did when movies about strong women in need of a stronger man starred Joan Crawford. Zoe also has a wise grandmother (Linda Lavin) who�۪s good for some cutesy gooey stuff at a retirement home. (Geezers say the darndest things.) But with her mother and father gone Zoe also has abandonment issues." Stan (Alex O�۪Loughlin) who�۪s so perfect for Zoe that even his name rhymes with man. He makes farmstead goat cheese  that he sells in the big city where he takes Zoe to dinner in a paradisiacal garden on Avenue B. (He�۪s a little bit country a little bit soft tinkling rock �۪n�۪ roll.) He even drives a tractor without his shirt  (or a farmer�۪s red neck) and talks thoughtfully about sustainable agriculture (really). He�۪s so perfect that he�۪s too perfect for Zoe who pushes as he pulls and pulls as he pushes as they do the commitment tango. It�۪s a tricky dance that becomes trickier as Zoe�۪s belly swells and her emotions and hormones start crashing against her fears." and pretty much looks like a lot of sitcoms do.

�۝ an attractive messy drama riddled with violence and edged with comedy that comes with a hint of Grand Guignol a suggestion of politics and three resonant deeply appealing performances. Set primarily in contemporary Argentina with intermittent flashbacks to the 1970s when the country was descending into a military dictatorship the film is by turns a whodunit (and why) a romance and something of a ghost story. A young dead woman lies at the center of the mystery but she�۪s scarcely the only thing here haunting the living." it�۪s because she�۪s initially conjured up in the imagination of Benjamin (Ricardo Dar�_n) a former court investigator. Now retired Benjamin first encountered the woman years earlier at her home where her naked body as is too often true of movie corpses was decoratively arranged on her death bed. The culprit at least when it comes to aestheticizing this particular horror is the writer and director Juan Jos̩ Campanella who has a tendency to gild every lily even a dead one. That inclination explains some of the film�۪s sudden shifts in mood and outlandish plot twists both of which can be preposterous but also create tension surprise and a sense of disquiet that borders on dread." having decided to write about the dead woman revisits her murder a pursuit that leads from the typed page into the offices of a judge and former colleague Irene (Soledad Villamil). A quarter-century ago Irene was his much younger supervisor toiling with him in a warren of book-lined paper-strewn rooms alongside a boozing desperate clown Sandoval (Guillermo Francella). Together the three tried to navigate around a bigger boss a jaundiced judge and through a system where the poor were railroaded for crimes they didn�۪t commit so they could serve the needs of the powerful. One such crime involves the dead woman." the murdered woman ��� or rather how Benjamin�۪s inquiry into her death affects him ��� brings to mind Otto Preminger�۪s ���Laura.�۝ In that 1944 noir Dana Andrews plays a detective who while investigating what he believes is the murder of the title character (Gene Tierney a natural stiff) falls in love with the victim or rather her portrait. Benjamin doesn�۪t fall in love with his dead woman though the way he looks at her corpse and then her photographs suggests more than he can admit. But this long-gone woman seems to exert a hold on him possessing him while he pecks out another page as the camera crawls through the shadows and Mr. Campanella pokes into the past." �۝ a comedy) and numerous directing gigs for American television shows including the ���Law & Order�۝ franchise. Although he executes some flashy moves in ���The Secret in Their Eyes �۝ routinely calling attention to the camera ��� as in an aerial shot of a stadium in which the camera appears to descend seamlessly into the roaring crowd before chasing after a single character ��� it�۪s the performances that stick with you along with Sandoval�۪s booze-soaked melancholia an occasional scripted eccentricity and the chaos of the increasingly impotent justice system. The scenes between Mr. Dar�_n and Ms. Villamil aren�۪t subtle (their eyes aren�۪t especially secretive) but they appealingly convey the warmth of habit and heat of regret." as are several comic scenes ��� including a funny exchange during which Benjamin and Salvador�۪s amateur sleuthing comes under mocking attack ��� which show Mr. Campanella at his most nimble. (That adroitness helped the film win this year�۪s Academy Award for best foreign-language picture.) Less persuasive is his use of the military dictatorship which takes on ugly human form primarily in the characters of a violent criminal and a bureaucrat who facilitates his brutality. The scenes with these thugs are blunt and effective: the creep-out factor is high. But they also frame the dictatorship in terms of individual pathologies with little evident politics to make anyone feel uncomfortable as the memories of murder are inevitably turned into smiles." murder and other brutalities."

On his deathbed in a V.A. hospital outside Philadelphia Kelly afraid of going to hell pleads with Harry to contact Dave  Kagan (Campbell Scott) a sailor in their unit who was Harry�۪s best friend and apologize for his role in Kagan�۪s near-fatal beating." in which Kagan�۪s right hand was smashed ending his hopes of being a concert pianist. One of several shadowy black-and-white flashbacks reveals that Harry instigated the attack after a member of their group observed Kagan making a pass at him  in the shower." making his way from upstate New York to Miami and back reconnects with the other men in his unit whom he hasn�۪t seen in 30 years. None have forgotten what happened and except for one all are haunted by guilt." Nicholas T. Proferes�۪s single-minded screenplay methodically lays out the film�۪s deconstruction of a traditional masculine code in which homosexuality is the ultimate taboo. The attack on Kagan was an example of vicious unexamined reactive homophobia that destroyed the dreams of a potentially great artist. As more details are revealed about Kagan a sad spectral figure who appears late in the film he is remembered as a beautiful almost saintly young man whose jazz records opened an artistic realm to his Navy buddies." the sailor who observed what seemed to be an unwelcome sexual advance. The moment Harry enters the house Peter�۪s angry sex-starved wife Judy (Mariann Mayberry) pounces on him and Harry finds himself dragged into a domestic nightmare in which we learn that Peter has a gay son who is exiled from the family. Peter is the movie�۪s ultimate caricature of bigoted middle-aged machismo run amok." who at first pretends not to know him. But when they meet in private Porter acknowledges Harry and tells him sadly that he has a son fighting in Iraq. The message is none too subtle: homophobia = violence =war." the gravity of its tone is relentless. Each of its miserable characters especially Mr. Savage�۪s Rheems is a case study in a film that hits you like a strident polemical essay. The wives and girlfriends who hover on the movie�۪s fringes are either bitter and ravenous or ineffectual. Without quite meaning to the film suggests that for its characters (and maybe for men in general) male bonding is the only bonding that really matters; that unhappy marriages and disappointing children are the collateral damage of male friendships contaminated by the terror of surrendering to their romantic component." Mr. Sheridan�۪s measured sorrowful performance tries (not always successfully) to pull it back from the brink.

The screenplay by the longtime Merchant Ivory collaborator Ruth Prawer Jhabvala gamely tries to camouflage reams of exposition necessary for the plot to advance smoothly. But too often you hear the machinery clicking and the narrative energy eventually dissipates. Lacking the nuggets of illumination that lend a Chekhov play its universality or the refined moral scrutiny of a James or Forster novel ���The City of Your Final Destination�۝ feels trivial despite its high tone and impeccable manners." Ms. Linney gives by far its sharpest performance as an unhappy widow who yearns to flee South America for New York.

�۝ a two-part nearly three-and-a-half-hour science-fiction reverie originally made for German television dates back to 1973 and was based on a novel by the American writer Daniel F. Galouye that was first published nearly a decade earlier." �۝  which will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art starting on Wednesday in a restored 35-millimeter print is undeniably an artifact of its moment. The clothes the cars and the furniture are richly even extravagantly redolent of the Euro-�۪70s as is the anxious tremor of political and sexual unease that vibrates (along with a sinister Muzak-y score) underneath the opulent surface." one of the most ferociously prolific and restlessly original artists German cinema has ever produced. Though Fassbinder who completed at least 40 films before his death at 37 in 1982 is impossible to pigeonhole he is perhaps still best known in the United States for historical dramas like ���The Marriage of Maria Braun�۝ and ���Veronika Voss.�۝" �۝ while too slow and diffuse to count as a lost masterpiece is valuable in expanding our sense of what Fassbinder could do and is also a source of much visual and intellectual pleasure in its own right." made in Paris on a relatively modest budget uses set design camera movement and clever editing (rather than elaborate special effects) to create a world of sinister conspiracy and tantalizing sensual possibility. The plot is both intricate and simple. Fred Stiller (Klaus L̦witsch) a scientist at the Institute for Cybernetics and Futurology begins to suspect that the organization�۪s most important project a government-run corporate-sponsored program called Simulacron is more complicated and less benign than it seems. People who know too much about it have a way of dying suddenly ��� one man simply vanishes from his armchair ��� and to get to the bottom of it all Stiller pursues a series of conversations with men in dark suits and women in brightly colored dresses." in a scenario that prefigures both ���The Matrix�۝ and ���Avatar �۝ to a virtual reality confected of electronic waves. That experience the core of Simulacron leads Stiller to believe that what he has previously understood to be his primary reality is also artificial. If there is another world ���below �۝ he reasons there must also be one ���above �۝ and whoever figures this out is in danger of being killed." �۝ and also quite a bit of philosophical musing as befits both the movie�۪s genre and its country of origin. But the slow pacing provides the viewer a chance to savor Fassbinder�۪s virtuosity. The acting is uneven ��� sometimes bluntly functional at other times full of soulful enigma ��� but the emotional payoff at the end is surprisingly fresh and strong. And the sheer audacity with which Fassbinder and his longtime cinematographer Michael Ballhaus move the camera alighting as if by accident on resonant and complex compositions is nothing short of breathtaking." like Fassbinder�۪s 18-hour  ���Berlin Alexanderplatz �۝ it demonstrates how thoroughly and uncompromisingly cinematic television can be.

Judged as a whole ��� that is watched from beginning to end ��� they don�۪t really justify their lengthy claim on our attention. There are repetitions large and small.

Therefore it shouldn�۪t matter if there�۪s significant overlap between a film about economic sanctions and university divestment and one about corporate divestment." if you want to learn about apartheid? ��� the fact is that the two easily could have been combined into a single film that would have been better at half the length. ���Have You Heard�۝ would have benefited from judicious editing throughout: you get the feeling that Ms. Field had trouble choosing among so many eloquent witnesses so many horrific pieces of old footage." consisting of three hourlong films is best. It proceeds chronologically from the institution of apartheid in 1948 through the Sharpeville massacre the jailing of Nelson Mandela and other African National Congress leaders Oliver Tambo�۪s establishment of the A.N.C. in exile the Soweto uprising the murder of the activist Steve Biko and the passage of the United Nations arms embargo in 1977." larger-than-life figures now little known to a general American audience: Mr. Tambo; Mr. Biko; the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme; the Anglican priest Trevor Huddleston; the Mata Hari of the anti-apartheid movement Conny Braam.

similar movies you probably know that nothing good is likely to come from taking somebody else�۪s bag full of cash. Perhaps Ray and Carla the adulterous couple at the center of ���The Square �۝ haven�۪t seen these films or have drawn the wrong lessons from them. After Carla comes across a satchel full of money that her loutish vaguely criminal husband has stashed in a crawl space in the laundry room of their house she and Ray concoct a plan to snatch it and get out of town. What else would they do? And what could possibly go wrong?" of course but Ray and Carla�۪s misfortunes are in the perverse tried-and-true logic of film noir a boon to the audience who can reap a clammy kind of satisfaction from a well-turned wallow in someone else�۪s depravity. ���The Square �۝ which is the first feature directed by Nash Edgerton an Australian stuntman turned filmmaker is a nasty gripping exercise in sin and comeuppance. Written by Matthew Dabner and Mr. Edgerton�۪s brother Joel it turns a humdrum Down Under backwater into a black hole of haphazard crime and arbitrary punishment." greed and desperation doesn�۪t make them all that unusual in this place it turns out. Their amateurism is what sets them apart and it is possible to feel sympathy for their weakness as well as disgust at their callous irresponsibility. Mr. Edgerton with crack timing in the editing room and a sure hand on the Steadicam is a coldblooded professional.

Ray is involved in some shady business dealings but he seems above all consumed by his infatuation with Carla (Claire van der Boom) who is much younger and who lives in a rougher working-class part of town." but her character is missing a nuance or two. On the other hand nuance is not really part of Carla�۪s world. Her husband Smithy (Anthony Hayes) is less a monster than a run-of-the-mill thug with a ginger-colored mullet haircut and a dog who might be his better-looking canine cousin." she and Ray hire an arsonist to burn the house down figuring that the fire will cover up their theft and give them time to escape." a lot goes wrong but one of the pleasures of ���The Square�۝ is watching its intricate  plot unfold. The accidents complications and reversals that drive the movie forward ��� an unintended death followed by a few that are less accidental; a series of blackmail letters; foul weather; a shark attack ��� feel less like the usual mechanical twists than like the perverse and ruthlessly logical operations of fate itself." rigorous cynicism of the script is matched perfectly by Mr. Edgerton�۪s ruthless cinematic discipline. Human motivations are almost universally venal. One of the only decent people in this town is the arsonist ��� played by Joel Edgerton the co-screenwriter  ���  who is kind to his simple-minded young girlfriend (Hanna Mangan-Lawrence) and attached unlike Ray to a semi-workable code of professional ethics." meanwhile ends up pretty much in the same place as the ugliest bad guy. And by the time the final measure of rough cosmic justice is meted out ���The Square�۝ has completed a tour of moral squalor that is suspenseful invigorating and sometimes harshly funny." how about a nine-minute short that is a sharp sick tour de force in its own right?

�۝ a sun-kissed German film about a young couple in love and in doubt might not be perfect but so much is right and true in this lovely delicate work that it comes breathtakingly close. Written and directed by Maren Ade it involves Gitti (Birgit Minichmayr) and Chris (Lars Eidinger) who are vacationing at his parents�۪  Sardinian  villa. When the film opens his sister is whisking her family off leaving the couple alone. It�۪s an ideal setup for Gitti and Chris who can�۪t keep their hands off each other and in whose half-dressed bodies you can see and feel the heat of the island the eroticism too." or at least the somewhat exploratory way that Gitti�۪s hands travel over Chris�۪s body in an early scene as he tries to read one afternoon and he struggles barely perceptively not to get irritated. They�۪re lying outside ��� as she often is Gitti is in a bikini while Chris is stripped to the waist ��� and the Mediterranean light brushes their skin with a warm gold. Ms. Ade shoots the scene in a medium close-up so you�۪re near enough to see almost intuit the pleasure and hesitation tugging at Chris�۪s mouth as Gitti�۪s face erupts in radiant laughter." yet there�۪s nothing careless about the shot which reverberates with meaning. It�۪s important for the couple�۪s dynamic and to Ms. Ade�۪s point of view ��� perhaps even to her point of view as a female filmmaker ��� that Chris is initially foregrounded in the scene which means you�۪re looking at his body stretched across the frame rather than Gitti�۪s." �۝ Chris complains with a hint of exasperation) while he sticks to books. Like so much else that happens in the first part of the film and seems irrelevant even pointless none of this seems to mean much." �۝ which is at once laid-back and rigorous. Ms. Ade doesn�۪t telegraph her intentions letting gestures glances seemingly unrelated events and offhanded remarks gather force. Yet even the way the couple make love as they do not long into the film is revealing and only partly because Ms. Ade doesn�۪t cap the scene with a close-up of Gitti�۪s ecstatic face as many male filmmakers might. Instead she drapes the scene in shadows which means that you see the actors�۪ undulating silhouetted bodies but not much of their faces. At this most private moment it�۪s their words and silences ��� ���I love you �۝ says Gitti which Chris answers with a kiss ��� that leave them naked." inability or just stubborn refusal to tell Gitti he loves her; there�۪s no need the moment resounds as loudly as a gunshot and you prick up your ears waiting for casualties. (Gitti meanwhile has no trouble telling Chris when she hates him.) It�۪s impossible to know who will fall. Ms. Ade is attentive to both characters and her sympathies shift between them: each is appealing and exasperating right and wrong passionate and carelessly affectionate. At times they seem like children particularly in their games ��� Chris makes a little animal a fetish really from ginger root and matches that they call Schnappi ��� but like most children�۪s play these exchanges feel like a rehearsal for adulthood." more established architect Hans (Hans-Jochen Wagner) and his wife Sana (Nicole Marischka) a successful designer. No one throws any dishes during the meal the first of two significant joint dinners but there�۪s plenty of wreckage by the time Sana serves the last drinks. As the scene plays out across an outdoor table and through the subtle choreography of the characters�۪ movements you watch as four people make and break allegiances. When Chris confides to Hans about his work ��� information he�۪d kept from Gitti ��� you see how a relationship can change with a few seemingly irrelevant words. You see the betrayal in Gitti�۪s stricken face; you might well feel it in your own body." Gitti playfully puts some makeup on Chris�۪s face painting his lips and drawing exaggerated lashes under his eyes. He jokes that she likes him as a girl and then more seriously asks if she sees him as masculine. She tells him the question is silly and then somewhat laughingly says ���Do something masculine and see if I notice.�۝ In some respects much of what happens in ���Everyone Else�۝ touches on many of the issues and anxieties that color all relationships heterosexual and otherwise when desire and power meet head on. But as the film�۪s title suggests this is about the world we create when we fall in love and how we navigate the space between us and that separating us from everyone else." with a naturalness that is rare on  the screen. A few scenes almost drag and a late flash of a knife feels false. But the film�۪s uninflected realism and unforced beauty alone make it worthy of exploring and revisiting as does the simple truth that love is too often an elusive subject in contemporary cinema. Ms. Ade doesn�۪t pretend to have an answer to our most profound questions about love in her plaintive scenes from a romance. But the wonderful last line ��� ���look at me�۝ ��� suggests one place to start."

a founding father of rock �۪n�۪ roll who with his younger brother Phil started Chess Records in Chicago ���  has neither the star power nor the epic sense of itself that infused ���Cadillac Records �۝ the 2008 film on the same  subject." understated lead performance by the wiry shape-shifting Alessandro Nivola who physically suggests a more refined Bruce Springsteen the movie offers a likable if doctored slice of rock history at its seminal flashpoint." ���Who Do You Love�۝ is less raucous more nostalgic and much smaller-scaled than ���Cadillac Records.�۝ As vintage cars slide by and legendary names are dropped you sometimes feel as if you are examining rare tintype photos of the South Side of Chicago. The characters in this screenplay by Bob Conte and Peter Martin Wortmann may be flesh and blood and the dialogue persuasive but the movie�۪s bits and pieces of rock lore feel carefully parceled out and softened by a pervasive reverence." guns appear payola is dispensed and drugs and booze are consumed. But the depictions of violence rage corruption and dissipation have the feel of historical set pieces. John Sayles�۪s 2007 film ���Honeydripper �۝ set in rural Alabama in 1950 conveyed a similar aura of being too enraptured with its subject for its own good although it must be said that given the immensity of rock mythology such self-consciousness in a nondocumentary may be unavoidable." immigrants from Poland who inherited a junkyard that they sold to capitalize their musical endeavors are portrayed as temperamental opposites with Leonard the visionary taking the risks while Phil (who didn�۪t appear in ���Cadillac Records�۝) stood back wrung his hands and felt underappreciated. Despite their differences they were close. Leonard is a wiry street-smart wheeler-dealer and proto-hipster obsessed with black culture who prefers to go on the road with Muddy Waters to vacationing with his family." in which Waters (David Oyelowo) is the primary catalyst and Bo Diddley (Robert Randolph) the bridge from the blues to rock. In ���Cadillac Records�۝ Chuck Berry (Mos Def) was the bridge." it plays fast and loose with time. No dates are given for Etta James�۪s 1961 hit ���At Last �۝  but it appears moved to the �۪50s without an appropriate adjustment in the style of the arrangement. In ���Cadillac Records�۝ Ms. James was memorably played by Beyonc̩ who displayed a surprisingly rough-edged soulfulness." the fictional James surrogate in ���Who Do You Love �۝ is a sultry balladeer who freezes in the recording studio unless she is high on heroin. Leonard takes her as a lover and in a desperate attempt to wean her off drugs locks her in a hotel room for two weeks. The affair nearly cost Leonard his marriage to his wife Revetta his  (Marika Dominczyk)." the bass player and songwriter who is his guide to Chicago�۪s black musical culture Waters is so poor he has to borrow a guitar. Mr. Oyelowo is very good but he is no match for Jeffrey Wright�۪s Waters in ���Cadillac Records.�۝ It should go without saying that musically none of the actors in either film can match the originals in raw forcefulness." early rock from doo-wop to Elvis Presley to the blues had the miraculous quality of seeming to emanate from a mysterious source; the original grooves are sacred."

He�۪s Sexy and He�۪s Dead �۝ blared the cover line of a 1981 Rolling Stone article about the Doors�۪ Jim Morrison 10 years after he died in a bathtub in Paris at 27. There was no autopsy. The same tinge of exploitation applies to ���When You�۪re Strange: A Film About the Doors �۝ Tom DiCillo�۪s muddled pretentious assemblage of film clips of the band shot between 1966 and 1971 with  solemn narration by Johnny Depp." preening screaming and going crazy onstage. The Lizard King as he was known was a charismatic male pin-up strutting about in leather pants as he played a cheesy pre-punk Dionysus writhing to the band�۪s snake-charmer music. He was also faintly ludicrous a sultry male Marilyn Monroe pouting and puckering as he gazed at his own imagined reflection with lowered eyes." the movie says audiences were drawn as much to the spectacle of a madman onstage as to the Doors�۪ music. Mr. DiCillo�۪s script is a shallow hodgepodge of biographical tidbits about the Doors larded with clich̩d images of the 1960s that have been recycled hundreds of times. (Robert F. Kennedy�۪s assassination again?) The film begins and ends with eerie excerpts from ���HWY �۝ a 1969 film in which Morrison is shown driving through the desert and hearing the news on the radio of his own death. (The broadcast was added to ���When You�۪re Strange.�۝)" the keyboardist Ray Manzarek the guitarist Robby Krieger and the drummer John Densmore  �� came together. ���When You�۪re Strange�۝ soon loses its train of thought and darts around in time leaving you thoroughly confused about what happened and in what order and how events related to one another." his original idol was later superseded by Frank Sinatra. There is footage of the notorious Miami concert at which Morrison was arrested for exposing himself although there is no photographic evidence that he actually did. The chaos he incited at that event is of the kind you don�۪t see at rock concerts nowadays." Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix in 1970 and �۪71 occurred at a moment when the road map charting the effects of the rock �۪n�۪ roll lifestyle at its most extreme had yet to be drawn. Pioneers of the youth culture�۪s determination to test limits all three were victims of an ignorant widespread assumption that drugs consumed indiscriminately were shortcuts to enlightenment. By today�۪s standards medical knowledge of addiction and of the body�۪s tolerance for drugs was sketchy; the concept of rehab had yet to enter the cultural conversation." he remains in a class by himself."

�۝ a Belgian coming-of-age turned coming-of-reason  story about a floundering 13-year-old turned struggling man initially comes across as aggressively unpleasant as  his crude boozing father and uncles. For the Strobbes as they proudly call themselves alcohol is thicker than water and almost as thick as blood: it brings them together in song mischief and misery uniting them in liquid brotherhood. Though some of them work they spend most of the time guzzling. They drink at the pub they drink at home. They drink until they pass out and then after they have had a good vomit they drink again." it almost is. The director Felix  van Groeningen throws himself into the raucous story with energy pushing the camera into visceral proximity of the brothers at their worst. (Your nose might twitch at the phantom stench.) The adults are big men and when they gather in the modest rooms of their mother�۪s house where they live they seem too large to fit. Their dimensions speak to  their condition as adults still flapping about in the parental nest. But their size boisterousness sloppy gestures outlandish behavior also eat up all the space. They crowd the 13-year-old Gunther (Kenneth Vanbaeden); years later when he�۪s an adult (Valentijn Dhaenens) they�۪re crowding him still." whether riding bicycles naked sloshing around in drag or bellowing a smutty drinking song. Each has a distinct look and at least one tic. Lowie (Wouter Hendrickx) is the prettiest of the bunch a strutting lady�۪s man; Pieter (Johan Heldenbergh) has a walrus mustache that hangs on his face like a painted frown; Koen (Bert Haelvoet) simply excels at everything drinking included. The most memorable is Gunther�۪s father Marcel (Koen De Graeve in a surprisingly sensitive moving turn) a postman whose mournful eyes and trembling hands express  a deep pain that emerges incrementally and without the poor pitiful me  analysis that so often accompanies sodden stories." tiny as a sparrow at times seems bewildered to be in the same house with these men. (She looks too small  to have survived their births much less their lives.) Like the teenage Gunther she�۪s a bystander to the ongoing chaos and for much of the story you don�۪t know what she�۪s thinking. She washes the clothes and cooks the meals scurrying around with a bowed head. Based on an autobiographically tinged novel by Dimitri Verhulst Mr. Groeningen and Christophe Dirickx�۪s script  doesn�۪t explain the family through the dialogue ��� the actions here are plenty loud. The only one who does finally talk about what happened and why is the adult Gunther at first a startlingly unlikable character." when he was living with his family. Shooting in digital Mr. Groeningen gives  the flashbacks attenuated colors and grit and makes good use of the   fast sometimes frantic hand-held camerawork. Though the occasional shifts between color and black and white are needless and distracting the swings between the past and the present are well integrated with each time period informing the other. Gunther it turns out is writing his own  story the one you�۪re watching whenever there�۪s a   cut to the past when he was young and still under the influence of a family he loved until it hurt. If the movie seems to love these crazy people too much it�۪s because he did too." near brutal to his girlfriend ��� is extremely well managed and shows just how subtle this loud seemingly rough tale really is. Mr. Groeningen wrings a lot of queasy comedy out of the Strobbes for a long stretch immersing you in their mess bringing you uncomfortably close to their muck. Even young Gunther who in one scene laughs and watches as an entire bathroom of school toilets burbles up sewage seems party to the grossness. Only when he gently helps his father take his first drink of the day ��� Marcel can�۪t lift it himself because his body is violently shaking from delirium tremens  ��� do you fully understand that this comedy is more of a tragedy." based on the novel ���De Helaasheid der Dingen�۝ (���The Misfortunates�۝) by Dimitri Verhulst; director of photography Ruben Impens; edited by Nico Leunen; music by Jef Neve; production designer Kurt Rigolle; costumes by Ann Lauwerys; produced by Dirk Impens; released by NeoClassics Films Ltd.

twin brothers from the Bronx are among the most prolific and inventive American filmmakers of the past half-century and  perhaps the most eccentric. Avid moviegoers as children they began making 8 millimeter epics and after graduating from the High School of Industrial Arts in New York they gravitated toward the thriving underground film scene. Shooting cheaply devising homemade special effects and casting friends and acquaintances the Kuchars produced �� sometimes in collaboration sometimes apart  �� touchstones of the 1960s cinematic avant-garde like ���Corruption of the Damned �۝ ���Sins of the Fleshapoids�۝ and ���Hold Me While I�۪m Naked.�۝" enough to give a flavor of the brothers�۪ blend of camp melodrama horror psychological exploration and sexual provocation. (And also at least a superficial sense of the differences between them.) This sampling is fleshed out by interviews with George and Mike Kuchar themselves and also with the usual talking-head parade of friends colleagues critics and students." unassumingly odd and frequently very funny. ���Did your parents get along?�۝ George is asked. ���Oh I wouldn�۪t go that far �۝ he replies." and will run this weekend alongside a multipart selection of the Kuchars�۪ 8 millimeter shorts.

This is not saying much: better than ���The Bounty Hunter�۝ or ���Did You Hear About the Morgans?�۝ is not quite the same as ���good.�۝" since rather than being the usual mismatched nice-looking pair of romantic comedy corn muffins they are accomplished professional funny people. Especially on television. And that�۪s part of the problem: ���Date Night�۝ sets these stars afloat in a busy and conventional story hoping that their proven talents or maybe their reputations will keep the picture from sinking. It doesn�۪t entirely but treading water for 90 minutes is no great accomplishment." anxious sarcasm that drives Liz Lemon through the showbiz tumult of ���30 Rock �۝ and though you can�۪t look at Mr. Carell�۪s face without inferring the antic cluelessness of Michael Scott in ���The Office �۝ both performers are constrained by the drab formula demanded by long-form big-screen entertainment. As Claire and Phil Foster a real estate agent and an accountant with two kids and a house in New Jersey Ms. Fey and Mr. Carell shoulder the laugh-killing burden of ordinary likability which means that they can�۪t be too smart too witty or too weird." or had just written the script themselves without regard for plot twists and character arcs and all the other creaky Hollywood machinery that keeps them running frantically from one set piece to the next." �۝ dutifully directed by Shawn Levy (���Night at the Museum �۝ among much else) from a hectic half-baked screenplay by Josh Klausner (the last and next ���Shrek�۝ movies) does have moments of pleasant mischief. Most of these come courtesy of supporting players who either turn Mr. Carell and Ms. Fey into straight men or else briefly rouse them to competitive comic life." but Claire and Phil�۪s contrasting reactions to the spectacle of his pectorals do elicit a few laughs. And then Mr. Wahlberg speaks Hebrew which can hardly fail to be hilarious. Even more so is an encounter with James Franco and Mila Kunis as a pair of would-be Alphabet City outlaws who show up to advance the plot and then for a few blessed moments derail it entirely." worried that their marriage has gone stale and that they�۪ve turned boring impulsively head into the city arriving at a super-chic restaurant without a reservation.

This means that guns will be pointed windshields will shatter and a lot of other noise will distract the audience from the uneven dialogue and scattershot marital foolery." never mind then. But let me just say that ���Date Night �۝ like so many other films of its type too often relies on words catchphrases and inflections that signify a generally accepted notion of funniness rather than being you know actually funny." but it�۪s uttered here as if believing that it did were sufficient to make it so. Same thing with the sarcastic rhetorical question �� ���Seriously?�۝ ���Really?�۝ �� that has become an almost universal lazy substitute for the traditional double take. And then there is the habit of trying to make a line retroactively uproarious by admitting that it really wasn�۪t funny to begin with." �۝ not untypically tries to go both meta- and sub- to be straightforwardly shticky archly self-conscious and also in the end sweet and sincere.

nasty calculatingly odd and a little funny though more often strained and inadvertently absurd ���After.Life�۝ changes its mood and  apparent intentions from scene to scene sometimes minute to minute. The period separating the words in the title probably alludes to the liminal state in which the heroine finds herself though it might also be a way to distinguish this movie from others with the same name. Whatever the case the little dot underscores the rather large conceits that sabotage what might have been a promising horror flick if not for the writing acting editing and consistently inconsistent tone." Anna (Christina Ricci) ends up not quite dead on a mortuary slab. The funereal gentleman tending her is Eliot (Liam Neeson) a mortician who�۪s a couple sandwiches short of a picnic and at least a dozen rewrites short of a successful character. Eliot breaks the bad news: She�۪s dead. Anna insists that she�۪s no such thing even if most of her dolorous actions and words suggest that he might be correct. Less a fully realized character than a plot contrivance and a visual distraction Anna (and Ms. Ricci) exists only to give the mortician (and the film) a young naked female body to play with. Though given how often her legs are discreetly arranged to obscure her nether regions she�۪s awfully bashful for a corpse." the director Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo making her feature debut and working from a script written with Paul Vosloo and Jakub Korolczuk gives her movie a comatose vibe: everything looks and sounds and feels muffled stifled drained of life. But while this numbing girds Eliot�۪s cheery idea that some of the living are already as good as goners ��� a notion that Ms. Wojtowicz-Vosloo seems to endorse if only because she seems more interested in Eliot than Anna ��� it also deadens the proceedings because there�۪s no modulation. It�۪s one thing to suck the air slowly out of a movie creating a sense of unease claustrophobia and if everything works dread. But the trick is to reduce the air not withhold it." as Anna�۪s lover enters and exits every so often as does Chandler Canterbury as one of her students.) But the few good ideas are inevitably thwarted by the filmmaking as in an ineptly managed scene that crosscuts between Anna fumbling to unlock a door and Eliot driving off pumping gas paying for the gas and driving back home.

�۝ an earnest high-minded would-be sobfest about grief and healing left me dry-eyed and squirming with impatience. The first feature written and directed by Shana Feste this study of a family�۪s emotional devastation after the death of a perfect teenage son whom everyone remembers as ���the greatest�۝ (awful title!) wants to be a contemporary ���Ordinary People.�۝" Susan Sarandon and Pierce Brosnan playing the boy�۪s parents can cover up the mysterious gaps in continuity of a screenplay whose thudding dialogue spells out every emotion while refusing to clarify many crucial plot details. Overwhelming grief is an elusive subject for any movie but as films like ���The Sweet Hereafter�۝ and ���The Messenger�۝ have demonstrated a sensitively written and directed film about unspeakable loss can open the floodgates. ���The Greatest�۝ allows the release of only a feeble trickle." Bennett Brewer (Aaron Johnson) dies at the beginning of the film during a personal king-of-the-world moment when he foolishly stops his car in the middle of the street and is slammed from behind by a truck. Earlier in the evening Bennett who had made love for the first time with his high school dream girl Rose (Carey Mulligan) is avowing his devotion to her when the truck strikes." followed by the film�۪s most daring scene in which the camera fixes on Bennett�۪s parents Allen (Mr. Brosnan) a mathematics professor and Grace (Ms. Sarandon) and their younger son Ryan (Johnny Simmons) in the back seat of the limousine driving them home. This tableau in which no one speaks or makes eye contact is the film�۪s only moment to convey the magnitude of a loss that is beyond words." who miraculously survived the crash with no signs of injury pays a surprise visit to the Brewers whom she has never met and announces that she is pregnant with Bennett�۪s child; she says that she intends to keep the baby. Rose who has no means of support and whose background is left frustratingly vague eventually moves in with the family." who wakes up each morning sobbing becomes obsessed with finding out what happened in the 17 minutes between the accident and Bennett�۪s death and regularly visits the hospital where the driver of the truck lies in a coma. (Weirdly the book she reads aloud to him while he lies unconscious is Ralph Ellison�۪s ���Invisible Man.�۝)" she lashes out at anyone who offers comfort and resentfully keeps Rose at arm�۪s length." who tries to offer solace. Another follows Ryan to a grief support group where he meets Ashley (Zoe Kravitz) a seemingly sympathetic young woman. But their budding romance screeches to a halt with an incomprehensible plot twist. Ryan also has a history of drug abuse (marijuana) that is brought up then inexplicably dropped." whom Ms. Mulligan plays with the same twinkling sense of self-possession and secret knowledge that she brought to ���An Education.�۝ For Rose there are no signs of trauma just a gooey nostalgia for a boy she was just getting to know. At a certain point she disappears from the film only to return at the end with no reference to the presumed rift that drove her from the Brewers�۪ home. ���The Greatest�۝ is so badly edited that it barely makes sense." one mild sex scene and pot smoking."

�۝ an oddball comedy with the knowing festering heart of a neo-noir. Thomas Haden Church lips flat-lining voice droning plays the title character a school janitor in a lonely place whose life takes a detour after he receives a blast  out of the past. Somewhere in the night a phantom lady beckons. Suddenly Don heads down mystery street unaware that he�۪s about to tread dangerous ground alongside the writer and director Jake Goldberger. In the reckless moment the damned don�۪t cry: they kiss tomorrow goodbye and pile on the movie allusions." his former high-school sweetheart  who appears to be suffering from the same illness that afflicted Carol Burnett�۪s Nora Desmond (diagnosis: overacting). Along with her leery leering nurse Marie (Melissa Chessington Leo) Sonny lives in a white house nestled in an isolated pocket of green. There are no visible neighbors with prying eyes just a doctor Lance Pryce (James Rebhorn) with an inappropriate stethoscope. Something seems askew ��� the fitful awkward laughs have an uneasy undercurrent ��� but Mr. Goldberger doesn�۪t reveal his hand until he restages the scene from Billy Wilder�۪s ���Double Indemnity�۝ in which Barbara Stanwyck born to kill in sunglasses and a blond wig shops and schemes with Fred MacMurray." of course but she bounces from one narrative right angle to the next with melodramatic vigor laughing and weeping and tugging at the increasingly bewildered Don who seems happy to yield. Although an early shot of Don cleaning up a generous pool of blood while on the job broadly foreshadows the violence to come Mr. Goldberger tends to let his actors do most of the work. There might not be much going on in terms of framing and camera moves but when you pack your movie with performers like Mr. Church Ms. Leo Mr. Rebhorn and Keith David (as Don�۪s old friend) all with faces and deliveries that can slide easily between comedy and menace you�۪re holding a full house." the Coen brothers as an influence on ���Don McKay �۝ specifically ���Blood Simple.�۝ The Coens are nimble magpies with noir a reliable source of inspiration. ���Blood Simple�۝ was heavily informed by cinematic noir and literary pulp fiction ��� including both  James M. Cain�۪s novel ���Double Indemnity�۝ and Wilder�۪s blissful take of the same ��� as were Coen brothers films like ���The Big Lebowski�۝ (a gloss on ���The Big Sleep�۝) and ���The Man Who Wasn�۪t There�۝ (���Double Indemnity�۝ yet again). This makes Mr. Goldberger something of a second-generation magpie ��� he has even cast M. Emmet Walsh who plays a pivotal role in ���Blood Simple �۝ as a cabby here ��� which helps explain the appeal of ���Don McKay�۝ and its limitations." you recognize the allusion smile (or not) and wait for the payoff. The problem is that for the reference to have any meaningful resonance you need to be familiar with the Wilder film which in turn sets up a level of expectation that Mr. Goldberger and the cast can�۪t meet. If you don�۪t recognize the reference well you might wonder what Don sees in this dame with the wild eyes and endless supply of negligees. The answer is surprisingly moving and suggests that Mr. Goldberger once envisioned telling a very different movie." my sweet." Los Angeles and Boston."

thundering gods shrieking monsters ��� about all that�۪s missing from the self-consciously kitsch retread of ���Clash of the Titans�۝ is Laurence Olivier pitching a fit in a toga. Released in 1981 the first ���Clash�۝ starred Sir Larry as Zeus alongside titans of the stage and screen like Claire Bloom (as Hera) Maggie Smith (Thetis) and Ursula Andress (Aphrodite). Harry Hamlin wearing the ���dry look�۝  and robes so voluminous he could have rigged the entire Greek fleet played Perseus the half-human son of Zeus whose adventures and pillowy lips pushed this mythic tale straight into the realm of cinematic camp." not to worry: there are titans they clash. Along the way Perseus triumphs and a villainess loses her head though by the time that happens you might wish the reverse were true. Although tricked out in superfluous often distracting 3-D the remake doesn�۪t as much improve on the original as match it goofily amusing moment for moment. One diverting attraction is the Djinn desert inhabitants with subwoofer vocalizations and questionable ethnic associations. Among the other stereotypes lingering at the edges are some decorative items (Gemma Arterton as Io Alexa Davalos as Andromeda) whose lack of presence is more lethal than Medusa�۪s gaze." notably Ralph Fiennes who entering in a cloud of soot �� la Pigpen appears to have flown in from the last ���Harry Potter�۝ to stir up trouble as Hades. (Even with his body and face digitally obscured Mr. Fiennes reminds you that what really animates effects-laden movies are people.) Looking every inch a heavy-metal god with a tangle of beard and power shoulder pads Liam Neeson plays his brother Zeus who rules from Mount Olympus where his back-up band includes another sibling Poseidon (Danny Huston) and Apollo (Luke Evans) one of several pretty boys rounding out the cast." who as Perseus comes equipped with the same buzz cut and sexy scowl that served him well during the live-action sequences in ���Avatar.�۝ That glower suggests that Mr. Worthington either believes he�۪s in a significant movie or worries he�۪s made a huge career mistake; either way he�۪s the latest big-screen attraction to strap on a sword and sandals to vanquish the box office. (He�۪s Russell Crowe 2.0.) It�۪s still unclear if he can act (Mr. Crowe certainly can when he�۪s in the mood) but he holds the screen effortlessly while the likes of Polly Walker (as Cassiopeia) and Mads Mikkelsen (Draco a warrior) do their best to fill in the holes with their charisma and marvelous faces." who started out working for the French producer Luc Besson (���Unleashed�۝)  before graduating to bigger-budgeted junk (���The Incredible Hulk�۝) brings nothing new or noteworthy to ���Clash of the Titans.�۝ The characters including the inevitably valiant warriors who aide Perseus during his computer-assisted adventures are as predictable as the action scenes which is what some companies want when they manufacture global products of this type. But enough of the myth remains to keep your eyes open as do some of the performances ��� Mr. Fiennes earns his pay ��� even when the frenetic editing at times pitches the movie into near visual incoherence. The finale which lurches among locations destroys all notion of time space sense." the special-effects wizard whose stop-motion animations enlivened fantasies like ���Jason and the Argonauts�۝ and influenced generations of filmmakers Peter Jackson included. (Mr. Jackson has described ���The Lord of the Rings�۝ as ���my ���Ray Harryhausen movie.�۪�ʉ۝) Mr. Harryhausen isn�۪t listed in the credits for the ���Clash of the Titans�۝ makeover. He should be. Not only because of his enormous influence on the fantasy genre but also because of his creature designs for the first ���Clash �۝ which he helped produce. The creatures in the redo ��� specifically hissy Medusa and the monstrous Kraken  ��� might have been partly conjured up  in a computer but they were dreamed up  for the screen by Mr. Harryhausen." the year that Steven Spielberg cheekily resurrected the Saturday matinee with ���Raiders of the Lost Ark �۝ the sincerity alone of the first ���Clash of the Titans�۝ made it seem old-fashioned. The next year ���Tron�۝ and its computer graphics pointed to the post-Harryhausen movie world in which stop-motion models and their handmade like  would   yield  to computer-generated imagery. Given this it�۪s interesting that the 3-D in the ���Clash of the Titans�۝ remake which was added after it was shot has none of the immersive quality of ���Avatar�۝ and instead segments the image into discrete planes bringing to mind the unintegrated levels of a pop-up book.

�۝ a documentary by Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam is so awkwardly executed that at first it may come across as just another chorus of a familiar song: that Tibetans think they have been done terrible injustices by China. But pay close enough attention and eventually another entirely different theme emerges: the Dalai Lama may be losing his ability to keep the more radical elements of the free-Tibet movement in check." which coincided with the Chinese government�۪s efforts to improve its image as it prepared to host the summer Olympics. The Dalai Lama long ago backed away from calling for independence for Tibet which has been under Chinese control for half a century instead endorsing a so-called middle way that emphasizes preservation of culture. But many of the protesters wanted a return to a more militant stand." chronicling the Dalai Lama�۪s somewhat muddled attempts to respond to the protesters�۪ calls while not antagonizing China do a fair amount of muddling themselves. They lurch awkwardly between reverence for the Dalai Lama and hints that he has become politically irrelevant or an obstacle." accustomed to a less timid style of documentary may come away from this one feeling that it only scratches the surface of a complex issue. The presence of this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January caused China to withdraw two movies from that event but the documentary is as much a challenge to the Dalai Lama as it is to the Chinese."

In that film Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum play the star-crossed young lovers whereas in ���The Last Song�۝ the duty falls on Ms. Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth who in spite of being a real-life item  are just not up to the task." a recent high school graduate named Ronnie arrives at her father�۪s beautifully run-down beach house on the Georgia coast carrying quite a bit of baggage. Dad (Greg Kinnear) and mom (Kelly Preston) are divorced leaving Ronnie and her younger brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) in some distress.

But  acting for the moment at least seems almost entirely beyond her. In ���The Last Song�۝ she pouts slouches storms in and out of rooms and occasionally cracks a snaggle-toothed smile but most of the time she seems to be mugging for the camera play-acting rather than exploring the motives and feelings of her character." his slyness and subtlety seem wasted in a project that has no interest in either.

adrift in their 40s who try to recapture the lost joys and squandered possibilities of their youth. I�۪m not entirely joking though the movie itself is a nonstop barrage ��� somewhere between a riot and an orgy ��� of crude obnoxious gags and riffs. If you are a connoisseur of sexual scatological or just plain stupid humor you will find your appetite satisfied even glutted. But viewers of a certain age and background ��� let�۪s say those who know the lyrics to ���Jessie�۪s Girl�۝ by heart even if they never really liked that song ��� are likely to endure the merry anarchy with a twinge of pained slightly nauseated nostalgia." Lou and Adam whom we first meet in the throes of early middle age are still haunted by memories of the 1980s when they were young and dumb and full of potential. Here in the weary present Adam (John Cusack) has just been dumped by his live-in girlfriend and you have the feeling that this kind of thing has happened to him many times before." but his job in a dog-grooming salon provides regular humiliating reminders of the musical career he might have had. And Lou (a frighteningly manic Rob Corddry) is an alcoholic divorced wildly self-destructive train wreck of a man. But the movie doesn�۪t really ask you to pity these guys; they feel sorry enough for themselves already and their misery seems well earned in any case." joined by Adam�۪s  doughy  20-year-old nephew Jacob (Clark Duke looking like a younger less smug version of the Apple scapegoat and ersatz know-it-all John Hodgman) light out for a ski resort that was once the scene of some vaguely recollected endlessly mythologized youthful debauchery. They find the place a dilapidated shell of its former glory but a night in a hot tub ��� which is exactly what the movie�۪s title says it is ��� transports them back to 1986 when the place was buzzing with bad haircuts garish clothes and enough winking pop culture references to furnish a weeklong Trivial Pursuit tournament. Hey isn�۪t that Chevy Chase? It is!" �۝ ���The Karate Kid�۝ and ���Back to the Future�۝? ���Hot Tub Time Machine�۝ sure does the last one in particular. Crispin Glover George McFly himself shows up as the ski lodge bellhop and while there is no DeLorean on the premises there is a brilliant send-up of the prom scene where Michael J. Fox�۪s Marty McFly invented rock �۪n�۪ roll. (It involves Mr. Robinson and the Black Eyed Peas. I�۪ve spoiled nothing)." of course is an �۪80s allusion in his own right starring in moves like ���The Sure Thing �۝ ���Better Off Dead�۝ and ���Say Anything �۝ and his status as a walking sight gag relieves him of the burden of being actively funny a job few men can do as well as Mr. Robinson or Mr. Corddry." but also potentially offensive. Steve Pink the director and a trio of dementedly scholarly screenwriters (Josh Heald Sean Anders and John Morris) load up every scene with more jokes than necessary ��� visual allusions verbal flourishes and plain old fall-on-your-face slapstick ��� but their excess proves to be a canny strategy. The picture moves so quickly and crazily swerving and skidding and doubling back for seconds that minor lapses in wit are immediately overtaken by major (and therefore hilarious) lapses in taste." guy-centric comedies these days is certainly present here. But unlike say ���The Hangover �۝ which sweetens and sentimentalizes its man-child characters  ���  allowing them to run wild and then run home to Mommy ��� ���Hot Tub Time Machine�۝ is honest in its coarseness  and pretty tough on the fellows who are the agents and objects of its satire." but the phony happy ending you find yourself dreading doesn�۪t quite materialize. Or rather the ending ��� not to give too much away ��� is so blatantly fantastical that it offers far less comfort than it might. It vaults the film into a realm of wish fulfillment that while delightful  to contemplate (if only for Mr. Corddry�۪s hair extensions) also carries a bracingly bitter aftertaste. ���Hot Tub Time Machine�۝ may be a goofy lusty uninhibited lark but its true subject is the disappointment that threads through every phase of the life cycle." Lou and Adam are miserable in 2010 but one thing that becomes clear pretty quickly is that they weren�۪t all that happy in 1986 either. ���All we had was Reagan and AIDS �۝ Adam laments." as the movie suggests they ��� we ��� had so much more including heavy metal and not-yet-old-school hip-hop cocaine by the bushel and spandex by the mile it was not easy to be young. Just look at the faces of the younger selves Nick Adam and Lou sometimes glimpse in the mirror. These guys are confused and terrified." worried presence as an ambassador from the era of text messaging and Second Life serves as a reminder that nothing much has changed. And of course being 40 is no picnic either." to be recycled cherished mocked and travestied provides small  ��� but nonetheless real  ��� compensation for the spiritual deficits of modern life. Is it crazy to write that sentence in a review of ���Hot Tub Time Machine�۝? Not really: the movie itself proves the point. It�۪s fun it�۪s sad and it�۪s kind of sad that it�۪s so much fun." more drugs more rock �۪n�۪ roll more hair."

�۝ a sly rethink of the freakily morbid fairy tale the filmmaker Catherine Breillat makes the case that once-upon-a-time stories  never end. Divided into two parallel  narratives  �� one focuses on Bluebeard and his dangerously curious wife while the other involves two  little girls in the modern era revisiting the tale �� the movie is at once direct complex and peculiar. It isn�۪t at all surprising that Ms. Breillat a singular French filmmaker with strong often unorthodox views on women and men and sex and power would have been interested in a troubling tale about the perils of disobedient wives. Ms. Breillat never behaves." �۝  ���Perfect Love �۝ ���Romance �۝ ���Fat Girl�۝ and ���The Last Mistress �۝ with their intellectually provoking intemperate and gutsy cinematic explorations of female desire. Some are shocking though less because they sometimes include depictions of real and feigned sex.

It�۪s that she has dared to put the often unarticulated and generally unrepresented on screen where everyone can see them. She makes the invisible women included visible." �۝ an unthrilling if still pungent work comes at the level of form in the bifurcated way she tells her story. Certainly Ms. Breillat suggests that this is very much her �� and every other woman�۪s �� story despite (perhaps because of) its provenance. The original was written by Charles Perrault (1628-1703) whose contributions to fairy tales are so influential �� he wrote down folk tales giving them shape �� Disney should pay his heirs royalties.  More than a century before the Brothers Grimm Perrault staked a claim on the female imagination in particular with ���Cinderella �۝ ���Little Red Riding Hood�۝ and ���Sleeping Beauty.�۝ He had a thing for girls and women in trouble making Ms. Breillat a good match." who likes to mix the blunt in with the oblique. The story involves an aristocrat (Dominique Thomas) with a number of mysteriously missing wives who takes a new bride Marie-Catherine (Lola Creton). One day before leaving on a trip he hands over his keys telling her that she can enter all the rooms save one. But after he leaves she unlocks the  forbidden chamber �� the wife must defy him for the tale to exist �� where she discovers the putrid bodies of his other wives hanging like meat. Meanwhile the two little girls (Marilou Lopes-Benites and Lola Giovannetti) keep popping in and out of the movie one reading the story of ���Bluebeard�۝ enthusiastically as the other blanches and recoils in horror." who move in period costumes through minimalist sets that have little of the sumptuous detail that tends to characterize more mainstream and costly efforts of this type. There�۪s a stripped-down quality to these trappings which might be a function of budgetary constraints but also complements Ms. Breillat�۪s analytic approach the critical distance she sometimes likes to assume. The sets the clothes the telegraphed performances �� actors recite lines that sound like lines �� along with the intermittent annotations from the little girls remind you that you�۪re watching a self-conscious fiction one that generations have preserved and recast." which was shot in digital that often looks too flimsy for Ms. Breillat�۪s big ideas (you might think of Cocteau�۪s ���Beauty and the Beast�۝ with a sigh) opens in a convent with Marie-Catherine and her older sister Anne (Daphn̩ Ba��wir) hearing of their father�۪s death. Anne weeps while Marie-Catherine rages and together newly impoverished they leave. On their journey home Marie-Catherine sees a castle and vows to live in one then learns that it belongs to Bluebeard.  She ends up in one after all. But before she does Ms. Breillat in a needless scene shows a servant beheading a fowl the camera lingering on its twitching body. Ah yes someone�۪s goose having been killed will  surely be cooked �� but whose?" who rewrote classic fairy tales to her own feminist ends including a version of ���Bluebeard�۝ that she titled ���The Bloody Chamber �۝ was interested in how they turn experience into stories particularly in respect to gender. It seems probable that Ms. Breillat is familiar with  Ms. Carter: the little girls in this screen revision for instance are dressed in gingham which is what the heroine of ���The Bloody Chamber�۝ wears before she marries the wealthy man she doesn�۪t love." suitably bloody and like all good retellings both similar to and different from earlier iterations. Like Ms. Carter Ms. Breillat does not let women off easy: they are rarely if ever simply (or simple) victims. And to see Marie-Catherine as purely Bluebeard�۪s victim is to forget that she has a part in how the story not only ends but also how it develops for good and for bad. For her part Ms. Breillat narrates the fairy tale three ways: in the period story through the little girls and finally through the overall film. None are fully satisfying but together they offer a sharp knowing gloss on how our stories define who we were and who we become." based on the tale by Charles Perrault; director of photography Vilko Filac; edited by Pascale Chavance; sets by Olivier Jacquet; costumes by Rose-Marie Melka; produced by Jean-Fran̤ois Lepetit and Sylvette Frydman; released by Strand Releasing.

exploring themes that are so familiar in the universe of all-ages cinema that they hardly need elaborating. The hero a young Viking named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is a misfit adolescent who proves his mettle pleases his hard-to-please father (Gerard Butler) and saves the world while learning important lessons and rattling off some wisecracks. Supporting characters include a spitfire love interest (America Ferrera) a gaggle of goofy friends (including the inevitable Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse) a crusty old mentor (Craig Ferguson) and a cute nonhuman sidekick." but this one a jet-black cat-eyed dragon named Toothless is one of the main attractions. Not that the rest of it is so terrible. ���How to Train Your Dragon �۝ directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders and based on a popular children�۪s book by Cressida Cowell is closer to the sweetness of ���Kung Fu Panda�۝ than the coarseness of the ���Shrek�۝ movies. Its borrowings from other movies are not egregious and its kinship with everything from ���Finding Nemo�۝ to ���Avatar�۝ puts it in reasonably good big-budget mass-entertainment company." this movie is about a young man who betrays his warlike tribe and learns to love the enemy. But the deeper similarity is visual. The rocky promontories off the coast of Berk (Hiccup�۪s windswept native island) are a lot like the floating mountains of Pandora and the various species of winged lizards capering in the skies above resemble the beasts ridden by Nav�۪i warriors in their battles against the sky people." rather than slapped on the DVD player when the children are acting up ��� lies in those airborne sequences. Movies and aviation grew up together and at least since William A. Wellman�۪s ���Wings�۝ won the first best-picture Oscar back in 1929 filmmakers have been obsessed with using the medium to capture the feeling of flight. When Hiccup first climbs on Toothless�۪s back and urges the dragon to take wing the hearts of the audience soar with a primitive and durable delight. The techniques that enabled this feeling may be dauntingly complicated but the feeling could not be simpler." to equally satisfying effect in the scenes that refer most directly to the film�۪s title. When Hiccup first meets Toothless a type of dragon especially feared by the Vikings of Berk the animal is hurt and scared. His damaged tail prevents him from flying and Hiccup outfits him with a brace and a prosthetic fin. But in the meantime the young man like Temple Grandin or Cesar Millan intuitively decodes the animal�۪s behavioral patterns debunking generations of Viking superstition about the bloodthirsty aggressive nature of dragons." which suggests that DreamWorks Animation has absorbed a useful lesson from its rivals at Pixar. The last two Pixar movies in particular ��� ���Wall-E�۝ and ���Up�۝ ��� have re-established the importance of silence in animated entertainment. Because the medium allows such freedom to create expressive images it often renders words superfluous. (The richness of the images here owes a lot to the participation of Roger Deakins the supremely talented live-action cinematographer on movies including ���No Country for Old Men�۝ and ���A Beautiful Mind �۝ who served as a visual consultant on ���How to Train Your Dragon.�۝)" though and John Powell�۪s score while occasionally obvious and bombastic is also subtle and sensitive when it needs to be. And what is true of the soundtrack applies to the movie a whole which is a shrewd blend of conventional pop-culture pandering and exalted cinematic artistry." ���How to Train Your Dragon�۝ is noisy and action-packed in the usual way attempting to justify the price of a ticket with eye-straining ear-popping large-scale effects. Really though sitting through those assaults is a price worth paying for the tenderness beauty and exhilaration that are the movie�۪s great strengths. The way the dragons look the way they move the way they catch the light dissolve in the mist somersault through the air and dive toward the ground ��� all of this is likely to make you forget the uninspired plot and the shopworn lessons even as you are reminded of some of the basic ecstatic reasons you go to the movies in the first place."

But when Sarah (Courtney Halverson) a redheaded siren given to poetic voice-overs accosts him in a diner with a plea for spiritual guidance Charlie unwisely follows his loins to a fate as bloody as the biblical passages he obsessively studies." ���Godspeed�۝ is a weird wordy but oddly compelling thriller balancing a hyperbolic screenplay (written by Mr. Saitzyk and Cory Knauf) with restrained special effects.

���The Eclipse�۝ makes good on its name by sometimes obscuring its themes and even point which can have its charms though  also severe drawbacks. Ciaran Hinds an actor with a thousand and one gloomy (glum dour sour grim deathly) faces plays Michael Farr a widower who lives quietly with his two children and photos of his dead wife hanging on the kitchen wall. A teacher and writer who does less  scribbling than instruction Michael (and his dog) has started to hear things go bump in the night leading him into the shadows where a figure suggests he might be haunted in more ways than one." who shares script credit with another Irish playwright Billy Roche. The screenplay  was adapted from one of Mr. Roche�۪s stories with substantial changes �� Michael�۪s wife has been killed off and a pinch of the supernatural has been tossed in �� though  someone forgot the connective tissue. The film which makes the time pass for its first hour feels like a series of disconnected ideas fragments really. By turns it�۪s a horror story with few boos a romance with barely a tingle a comedy with only sporadic laughs a tragedy without the requisite heft �� it does however make a nice enough platform for a showy turn from Aidan Quinn." Nicholas lands in the harbor town of Cobh in County Cork  for a literary festival. Under a brooding atmospheric sky he both solicits and waves off attention from men and women while busily arranging an assignation with another novelist Lena Morelle (Iben Hjejle). Wearing a  smile that lights up too readily (he�۪s always onstage and looking for an audience) Mr. Quinn shows us the galloping narcissism that quickly turns into a desperate crawl. (He�۪s a writer after all.) You see what Lena sees in him including his easy grin that sexy swagger which makes it hard to understand what attracts her to Michael." not the more attractive Nicholas or her. Michael helps out  as a driver during the festival which is how and why he motors Lena around showing her the sights as he whisks her past his wife�۪s grave. Eventually all three characters end up in a tangled heap that doesn�۪t make much sense but gives them a chance to raise their voices and stagger about even as  Mr. McPherson searches for the exit. Appealing in certain roles Mr. Hinds  and his looming menace work better when he�۪s yelling at someone or reacting in shock to one of the film�۪s stabs at horror than when he�۪s throwing moony looks at Lena." Mr. McPherson hasn�۪t yet found a steady style and his default mode here is to pile on the shadows and abruptly turn up the volume. (The characters do a lot of talking but don�۪t sound as if they�۪re reciting lines from a play a relief.) And while the horror interludes are often awkwardly managed a scene in which Michael slips in a dark seemingly fathomless pool of blood has the right  balance of shock horror and comedy. Even better is the moment when the camera races up the aisle of a packed  auditorium  just as Lena who�۪s giving a reading realizes that Nicholas has nosily entered.

�۝ Benito Mussolini once said. ���The mass is female.�۝  In ���Vincere �۝ a sustained alternatingly exhausting and aesthetically exhilarating howl of a film the veteran Italian director Marco Bellocchio brilliantly personalizes Mussolini�۪s rise to power through a fictional retelling of his seduction and catastrophically violent betrayal of his reputed first wife Ida Dalser. Like much of Italy Dalser abandoned herself to him body and soul. The film�۪s title ��� a reference to a popular Italian Fascist song ��� means to win as in to defeat vanquish surpass. ���Win win win!�۝ Fascist soldiers would sing as Il Duce aroused the populace. ���At any cost!�۝" played with deep feeling and rivers of tears by Giovanna Mezzogiorno that cost would be devastating. But first came love. You initially see her watching Mussolini (an outstanding Filippo Timi) during an early philosophical smackdown. ���I challenge God �۝ he bellows through a haze of cigarette smoke as his jaw thrusts into an anonymous meeting room like a fist. Mussolini then gives the big man upstairs five minutes to strike him dead: ���If he does not it will be the proof that he doesn�۪t exist.�۝  The small tightly packed audience facing Mussolini waits (as do we) judge and hanging jury combined as a smile creeps onto his face. ���Times up God doesn�۪t exist!�۝  he announces which given what happens next seems an easy call. (Ida meanwhile has found her god.)" painful severe tragic. Even so while it spans the relationship of Dalser and Mussolini from turgid beginning to brutal end the film doesn�۪t stick to the usual biopic template: there�۪s very little about their different histories for instance which are either ignored or sketched in. He materializes as if out of nowhere and you briefly see her in some kind of shop. (She owned a beauty salon.) As if mesmerized she rushes toward him as when she helps him hide from the police during a riot violence that they seal with a kiss." including Mussolini�۪s expulsion from the Socialist Party in 1914 because of his support for Italy�۪s entrance into World War I. He subsequently starts a newspaper that Dalser in a disastrous move helps bankroll. Having emptied her purse she then waits for him stretched out naked in bed like an offering which he greedily devours. Her magnanimity blurs into masochism as Mussolini ever more powerful and elusive gathers his fascist forces. By 1922 he is the dictator of Italy and the husband of his official first wife Rachele (Michela Cescon) and Dalser has given birth to a son Benito Albino (Fabrizio Costella) turning her and her child into enemies of the state." but he does suggest that Mussolini hid his real relationship with Dalser at least in part because he didn�۪t want to alienate the Roman Catholic Church with whom he had to share power. In one savagely pointed sequence set in a church doubling as a hospital he shows a bandaged Mussolini  (who finally got his much-coveted World War I) avidly watching a film about Jesus a juxtaposition that suggests not only how the dictator-savior saw himself but also how he would soon be seen by his country. Later after Mussolini becomes dictator Mr. Bellocchio who makes great use of old newsreels and other archival material throughout also throws in a photograph of the real Il Duce with some clerics to make just that point." it makes sense that Mussolini would have scorned Dalser who could only have taken on the role of the apostate. It�۪s a part that Ms. Mezzogiorno plays with great ferocity and given how much time her character spent yelling in mental institutions true stamina." a separation that irreparably damages them. It also hurts the movie because Mr. Bellocchio ��� who can�۪t get enough of her suffering though you eventually might ��� proves as loyal to her as Mussolini was disloyal. She might be enormously sympathetic but as the days turn into years and she keeps rattling her cage she comes very close to being more wearisome than tragic." but the world beyond her prisons ��� literal and psychological ��� has its obvious attractions .  And the truth is that she isn�۪t the only one who misses Mussolini who disappears from the film for a long stretch glimpsed only in newsreels and finally in the face of his grown son also played by Mr. Timi. His performance as the adult Benito is brief if masterly and devastating. Like the Hollywood B-movie directors of the golden age who created worlds out of shadows Mr. Bellocchio resurrects the tragedy of an entire nation with newsreel footage some smoke bits of Futurist art and the image of one Italian son in whose devastated face you see millions." based on a story idea by Mr. Bellocchio; director of photography Daniele Cipr��; edited by Francesca Calvelli; music by Carlo Crivelli; production designer Marco Dentici; costumes by Sergio Ballo; produced by Mario Gianani; released by IFC Films.

the land of midnight sun icy blondes and enough twisted thinking to plump up three best-selling mystery novels. From the way that most people look at the inked pierced form of Lisbeth Salander the main attraction in the movie adaptation of ���The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo �۝ the first book in Stieg Larsson�۪s so-called Millennium Trilogy you might even think that our girl had a swastika stamped on her forehead rather than a few modest rings hooked through her nose ��� you know like a cow ready for market or given the murderous milieu slaughter." as she�۪s usually called in the books is a devil doll par excellence and maybe if David Fincher makes good on the vaporous rumors wafting around about the inevitable American adaptation she might one day make an equally delectable film character too. Weighing in at 90 pounds of rage on the page and a hair heavier and less fierce on the screen where she�۪s played by Noomi Rapace Salander embodies a host of au courant fantasies. She�۪s a geek girl for starters a computer hacker who would have downloaded this flick before it even hit theaters and whose fetish wear and shiny boots suggest that she�۪s into BDSM as they say in bondage discipline and sadomasochism circles." Salander is also a victim turned avenger who rather than taking her traumatic past out on herself in classic female style say by cutting externalizes her rage. She doesn�۪t take anything lying down including sex and violence. She�۪s the top dog in bed as well as in the streets where she follows the creed that it�۪s better to die on your feet than on your knees. From one angle she looks like a consummate cool chick of the sort routinely conjured up by the science-fiction visionary William Gibson whose dream girl in his novel ���Pattern Recognition �۝ with her singular talents black clothes and sleek tousled ���anime hair rendered hi-rez �۝ could easily describe Salander." however than goth threads and ornamentation and much of what makes  Mr. Larsson�۪s first book worth the long haul (almost 600 pages in paperback) are the revelations about her spiky unsettling satisfyingly not-nice personality which her creator who died before the trilogy�۪s publication peels as deliberately as an onion. She�۪s a less disquieting presence in the movie (a protracted 152 minutes) which was competently sometimes ploddingly directed by Niels Arden Oplev and written by Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaj Arcel. Though Ms. Rapace is a fine professional scowler with cheekbones that thrust like knives and a pout that�۪s mostly pucker she tends to register as an intriguing idea instead of a thoroughly realized character. She more or less looks the part that the filmmakers don�۪t let her fully play." he crammed a fearsome amount ��� love sex historical traumas even an iBook plug ��� into ���Dragon Tattoo �۝ his first novel. As in the book Salander shares narrative pride of place in the movie with a journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist adequate and sympathetic) who after losing a highly publicized libel case to a corporate titan is hired by a semi-retired captain of industry Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) an  octogenarian who wants to know how and why his favorite niece Harriet disappeared decades earlier. Vanger suspects one of his creepy-crawly relatives some of whom were active Nazis during World War II." the writers have ditched plot details and characters even as they�۪ve lifted crucial material from its sequel ���The Girl Who Played With Fire.�۝ These incendiary visuals borrowed from Salander�۪s childhood make the glib case for why she�۪s such a head case. But the flashbacks are so visually and thematically blunt that they upstage the narrative�۪s interesting parallels and disturb its political undertow: Salander and Blomkvist initially occupy separate story lines that seem to converge only because she�۪s hired to spy on him. Along the way each runs a gantlet of patriarchal violence (personal social capitalist) a trail of horrors that ends in a pile of bodies. Each is also a victim of that violence which gives the story a political edge keeping it from pure psychodrama." �۝ which apparently wasn�۪t sexy enough for English-language bookshelves. The title change certainly spices things up no matter how commonplace body art is at least outside of Stockholm and it   plays down its overarching theme which the movie only does further. Just as significant is the substitution in the title of ���girl�۝ for ���women �۝ a categorical displacement (and diminution) that also shifts the emphasis from the crime (and criminals) and places it on Salander�۪s slender back." as is the tattoo adorning it even if like all the prettily photographed winter landscapes the dragon covers up something the filmmakers seem loath to reveal and simultaneously eager to exploit."

Written by Mr. Bong sharing credit with Park Eun-kyo ���Mother�۝ opens as a love story that turns into a crime story before fusing into something of a criminal love story. Nothing is really certain here even the film�۪s genre and little is explained even when the characters fill in the blanks. Though richly and believably drawn Mr. Bong�۪s characters are often opaque and  mysterious given to sudden rages behavioral blurts and hiccups of weird humor. But it�۪s this very mystery that can make them feel terribly real." more disturbingly persuasive than Mother who lives with her 27-year-old son Do-joon (Won Bin) in cramped quarters adjoining her tiny apothecary. Beautiful and strangely childlike Do-joon doesn�۪t seem right in the head: he�۪s forgetful seemingly na��ve perhaps retarded. (When he tries to remember something he violently massages both sides of his head in an exercise that Mother without apparent irony calls ���the temple of doom.�۝) But if he runs a little slow Mother runs exceedingly fast as you see shortly after the movie opens when while playing with a dog one bright day Do-joon puts himself in the path of an oncoming BMW which leaves him dazed if not particularly more addled." who busily chops herbs with a big blade in her darkened shop while casting worried glances at Do-joon as he goofs off across the street. From her vantage point he looks as centered within the shop�۪s front door as a little prince inside a framed portrait. The dim interior and bright exterior only accentuate his body ��� the daylight functions as a kind of floodlight ��� which puts into visual terms the idea that he is the only thing that Mother really sees. Mr. Bong may like narrative detours stories filled with more wrong turns than a maze but he�۪s a born filmmaker whose images ��� the spilled water that foreshadows spilled blood ��� tell more than you might initially grasp." unsettling dark comedy in violence and once again the blood does run if somewhat less generously than in ���The Host�۝ and his often brilliant ���Memories of Murder.�۝ Although Do-joon seems to recover from his accident the event sets off a chain of increasingly violent incidents that culminate in the murder of a local schoolgirl Ah-jung (Moon Hee-ra) whose body is found slumped over a roof wall in the village positioned one character says like ���laundry.�۝ Do-joon is summarily arrested for the death after an incriminating golf ball is found at the scene.

Perched on the knife edge between tragedy and comedy her delivery gives the narrative ��� which tends to drift sometimes beguilingly sometimes less so ��� much of its momentum. At times it feels as if Ms. Kim is actually willing it or perhaps Mr. Bong forward. Yet while Mother can seem like a caricature of monstrous maternity (���You and I are one �۝ she insists to the jailed Do-joon) the performance is enormously subtle filled with shades of gray that emerge in tandem with the unwinding investigation. There are several crimes in ���Mother �۝ and while none can be justified Mr. Bong works hard to make sure none are easily condemned." alternately dazzling and frustrating. Mr. Bong�۪s virtues as a filmmaker including his snaking storytelling and refusal to overexplain actions and behaviors can here feel like evasions or indulgences rather than fully thought-out choices. There�۪s a vagueness to the film that doesn�۪t feel organic ��� as if having created a powerhouse central character he didn�۪t exactly know what to do with her.

From ���Bloody Sunday�۝ through the second and third ���Bourne�۝ movies (which turned Mr. Damon into a minimalist movie star) this director has honed his skill at balancing chaos with clarity. Using locations in Morocco and Spain uncannily doctored to resemble the Baghdad we know from documentaries and contemporary television news feeds Mr. Greengrass (decisively aided by the stroboscopic vision of his cinematographer Barry Ackroyd who also shot ���The Hurt Locker�۝) choreographs foot chases and gun battles that unfold with the velocity complexity and precision of a Bach fugue played on overdrive." justly rewarded at this week�۪s Academy Awards for her stringent soulful work on ���The Hurt Locker�۝ ��� Mr. Greengrass has never been interested in technique for its own sake. Action under pressure is for him a test and a revelation of character. ���The Bourne Supremacy�۝ and ���The Bourne Ultimatum�۝ refined this axiom to its philosophical essence. Mr. Damon�۪s character in those movies never knew who he was until he saw what he did." of course is an ordinary fighter rather than an amnesiac superassassin but his predicament is not so different from Jason Bourne�۪s. His motives become apparent to him only at the moment of decision and the more confusing the circumstances the more quickly he must react." if also potentially hazardous: to help secure and take control of sites where Saddam Hussein�۪s weapons of mass destruction are believed to be hidden. But as the members of Miller�۪s team repeatedly come up empty ��� risking their lives to raid vacant warehouses and abandoned factories ��� he finds himself uncovering a hidden history of manipulation and double-dealing. His simple questions concerning  problems with the intelligence reports about the weapons lead him down a hall of mirrors into conflicts far more tangled than the simple black-and-white battle between democracy and tyranny." this is familiar territory. Mr. Greengrass and the screenwriter Brian Helgeland deftly glean material from the historical record and while they compress simplify and invent according to the imperatives of the genre ��� this is a thriller not a documentary ��� they do so with seriousness and an impressive sense of scruples. They have clearly studied journalistic accounts of the early days of the war citing Rajiv Chandrasekaran�۪s vivid ���Imperial Life in the Emerald City�۝ as a particular inspiration and while the picture they paint of infighting among the Americans and growing factionalism among the Iraqis may not be literally accurate in every particular it has the rough authority of novelistic truth." in particular a Pentagon intelligence officer named Poundstone played with perfect officiousness by Greg Kinnear. (It�۪s funny to think that the last time he and Mr. Damon met on screen it was as quarrelsome conjoined twins in Bobby and Peter Farrelly�۪s ���Stuck on You.�۝) Poundstone with a direct line to the Bush White House and a mastery of its idioms ��� ���democracy is messy �۝ he declares paraphrasing Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld ��� is the film�۪s stand-in for a number of real-life figures most of them not named because they don�۪t need to be." Poundstone is both a canny opportunist and a true believer dispensing idealistic bromides even as he wields a mean Machiavellian stiletto. His nemesis is Martin Brown a shambling C.I.A. man played by Brendan Gleeson whose knowledge of the region leads him to predict sectarian bloodshed and political paralysis. Miller is sucked into the power struggle between these two officials and the agencies they represent and he also makes contact with a journalist named Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) who has been publishing misinformation about the weapons that comes via Poundstone from a shadowy Iraqi source. (Though she works for The Wall Street Journal Dayne is likely to remind viewers of Judith Miller the former reporter for The New York Times  who was criticized after the invasion for reporting that helped to bolster the Bush administration�۪s case.)" there is back-stabbing and miscommunication ��� people on the same side working at cross purposes and sometimes in direct conflict. Miller experiences this in a series of encounters with a Special Forces hotshot played by Jason Isaacs who has a habit of showing up to undermine whatever Miller is doing sometimes punching him in the face for good measure." and ���Green Zone�۝ is admirable in its refusal to make them bit players in their own nation�۪s drama even though the Americans occupy center stage. A Baathist general named Al Rawi (Igal Naor) lurks in the shadows either a potential asset in the American effort to reconstruct the country or a dangerous obstacle. At Miller�۪s side is a man he calls Freddy (Khalid Abdalla) who serves as an informant and a translator and who expresses the deep ambivalence ��� the hope the disappointment the anger ��� of ordinary Iraqis who suffered under Hussein�۪s dictatorship and are not sure how much to trust their liberators." �۝ Freddy says to Miller in one of the film�۪s forgivably pointed lines. I say forgivably because ���Green Zone�۝ seems to epitomize the ability of mainstream commercial cinema to streamline the complexities of the real world without becoming overly simplistic to fictionalize without falsifying." while thrill-seekers may complain that the politics get in the way of the explosions and firefights. And the inevitable huffing and puffing about this movie�۪s supposedly left-wing or ���anti-American�۝ agenda has already begun." and are still in need of accessible and honest airing.

Along the way many people die but few matter: most are just part of the warm-up act as well as the means to a shamelessly exploitative end." yakky script about love and loss largely set in the summer of 2001. But Mr. Coulter doesn�۪t help matters by infusing the movie with grave self-importance. Everything comes weighted in significance from the way Tyler furiously smokes his cigarettes to the  camera movements that carefully show off the squalor in which this scion of a wealthy family has chosen to settle. The apartment actually looks pretty normal for a college boy flopping in a New York tenement. But as the camera lingers over the grimy paint you know you�۪re meant to grasp something meaningful about Tyler�۪s alienation from his bourgeois better-painted background.

The threat of a seizure hovers over the movie as does the specter of an outburst of pent-up half-understood feeling. Both things happen but the film is driven less by plot than by a desire to explore intimately and yet from a tactful distance the quiet moods and quotidian interactions of its characters." observant strains in Japanese and European cinema �� Hirokazu Kore-eda�۪s example is especially strong here �� ���The Exploding Girl�۝ is a companion piece to ���In Between Days �۝ which Mr. Gray wrote with his wife So Yong Kim who directed it.

�۝ a modestly scaled quietly effective independent movie about a struggling single mother and her two children. Directed and written by Tze Chun making a fine feature debut the movie offers both a familiar tale of immigrant striving and a topical look at what it means to be working and poor in America while hanging onto a badly frayed thread. Yet while the politics are there you might be too busy choking back tears to notice." in a present tense that feels as immediate as last week the movie tracks the steady seemingly inexorable downward spiral of Elaine Cheng (Cindy Cheung) a single mom eking out a near-sustenance existence. When she�۪s not trying (and apparently failing) to sell real estate Elaine spends a lot of energy chasing after dubious-sounding networking prospects the kind that promise riches in exchange for peddling lotions and paying a hefty fee to the company. Although she looks solidly middle class with her heels and business casuals Elaine has stumbled badly as the sheriff who serves eviction papers soon proves. Forced out the family stumbles even further." Elaine and her children �� a solemn-faced Raymond (Michael Chen then 10) and Tina (Crystal Chiu then 8) ��  move into a condo in a vacant building. It�۪s a model apartment just for show with no character and a fake phone: a poignant way station for a dislocated family. The condo like many of the movie�۪s low-key details feels just right. Mr. Chun who himself grew up outside Boston was the child of a scrambling immigrant single mom who sold stuff like Herbalife which probably helps account for the movie�۪s realistic texture from the condo�۪s bleak anonymity to the shabby chaos that nearly engulfs the family�۪s two nearby relatives neither of whom can be counted on for help." to pin too much of what makes this movie work on the autobiographical would give short shrift to Mr. Chun who makes the most of his obviously limited economic resources with confidence and talent. Working with his cinematographer Chris Teague and shooting in high-definition digital that tends to look like lower-end HD meaning a touch cold thin and gray Mr. Chun doesn�۪t fuss up his visuals. He doesn�۪t prettify poverty or bathe his characters in a celestial light as if they needed to be consecrated because of their difficulties as can be the case when filmmakers get their hands on the poor. (The Sundance Film Festival where ���Children of Invention�۝ first played in 2009 is sometimes filled with such beautiful suffering.)" streamlined story �� she becomes increasingly distracted by a suspicious business venture �� a distance opens between her and the children that becomes more and more unsettling. The muted understated performances from the two children (in their screen debuts) creep up on you and without any of the cutesy mannerisms and overflowing saucer eyes that can turn a child actor into the equivalent of a cheap narrative shot. Although in broad outline ���Children of Invention�۝ recalls ���Nobody Knows �۝ a classic of art-house sadism from the Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda about a mother who abandons her children the world that Mr. Chun creates is less cruel more ordinary plausible and temperate." �۝ of course echoes the expression the mother of invention a somewhat pitiful description for Elaine as she frantically grabs at a dream as elusive as smoke. (Ms. Cheung�۪s astringent turn solicits empathy and exasperation.) But the title also refers to the charming gadgets that Raymond creates like the mechanized spaghetti fork. Using odds and ends that he and Tina buy Raymond builds little inventions that speak to his ingenuity and every so often to something deeper and more desperate. From one angle he looks like a pint-size Thomas Edison seized by the spirit of American enterprise. From another he looks like a child of painfully recognizable hard times."

A few resemble science-fiction robots while others look like pixies out of Japanese anime." which are squared off and elongated in a way that suggests both crudeness and grace. These appendages are also large appearing slightly out of proportion to the bodies which makes sense given that the subject and method of this film is handicraft. ���The Secret of Kells �۝ directed by Tomm Moore concerns the Book of Kells a medieval illuminated manuscript that ranks among the most important artifacts of Irish civilization.

There he encounters a winsome fairy girl named Aisling (Christen Mooney) and a ferocious subterranean beast both of them reminders of an older pagan world surviving alongside and underneath the Christianity of Brendan�۪s uncle and his colleagues." �۝ which mixes folklore and history without too much piety or violence. The exact nature of the manuscript ��� the real Book of Kells contains the four gospels of the New Testament ��� is left vague. And the brutality of the faceless relentless marauders from the north is suggested rather than graphically shown so that the cruelty is likely to sail over the heads of very young children while giving older ones a not-too-upsetting thrill of danger." but the sometimes hectic plot ultimately serves as scaffolding for Mr. Moore�۪s extraordinary visual brio. Using the vivid colors and delicate lineations of the Book of Kells for inspiration he establishes a surprising and completely persuasive link between the ancient art of manuscript illumination and the modern practice of animation.

�۝ Tim Burton�۪s busy garish and periodically amusing repo  of the Lewis Carroll hallucination ���Alice�۪s Adventures in Wonderland.�۝ It�۪s a long fall turned long haul despite the Burtonian flourishes ��� the pinch of cruelty the mordant wit ��� that animate the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and the porker that slides under her feet with a squeal. ���I love a warm pig belly for my aching feet �۝ the queen tells Alice. Played by Mia Wasikowska Alice looks a touch dazed: she seems to have left her pulse above ground when she fell down the rabbit hole of Mr. Burton�۪s imagination." so it�۪s curious if not curiouser that he�۪s turned his sights on another 19th-century tale. Perhaps after slitting all those throats in his adaptation of ���Sweeney Todd �۝ he thought he would chop off a few heads. Whatever his inspiration he has tackled this new story with his customary mix of torpor and frenzy. After a short glance back at Alice�۪s childhood and an equally brief look at her present he sends the 19-year-old  on her way first down the hole and then into a dreamscape ��� unfortunately tricked out with 3-D that distracts more than it delights ��� where she meets a grinning cat and a lugubrious caterpillar among other fantastical creatures." this isn�۪t your great-grandmother�۪s Alice or that of Uncle Walt who was disappointed with the 1951 Disney version of  ���Alice in Wonderland.�۝ ���Alice has no character �۝ said a writer who worked on that project. ���She merely plays straight man to a cast of screwball comics.�۝  Of course the character of Carroll�۪s original Alice is evident in each outrageous creation she dreams up in ���Wonderland�۝ and in the sequel ���Through the Looking-Glass �۝  which means that she�۪s a straight man to her own imagination. (She is Wonderland.) Here she mostly serves as a foil for the top biller Johnny Depp who (yes yes) plays the Mad Hatter and Mr. Burton�۪s bright and leaden whimsies." the object of his much-debated love ���Wonderland�۝ (1865) is among many other things a testament to glorious nonsense as well as an inspiration for dark thoughts (about Carroll�۪s feelings for Liddell) and for lysergic works from the likes of David Lynch. It�۪s a total (head) trip one that starts and stops and doesn�۪t fit easily into the mainstream narrative mold which could explain why the screenwriter Linda Woolverton borrowing both from ���Wonderland�۝ and ���Through the Looking Glass �۝ has given Alice a back story a dash of psychology and a battle royal if alas not a pool of her own tears in which to swim." ���Alice in Wonderland�۝ probably seemed a good fit for him and there are moments when his transparent delight in the material lifts the movie and even carries it forward. His Wonderland (here Underland) isn�۪t inviting or attractive. The colors are often bilious though the palette also turns gunmetal gray bringing to mind ���Sweeney Todd.�۝ There�۪s a suggestively nightmarish aspect to Alice�۪s journey as when she steps on some severed heads   in the Red Queen�۪s moat as if they were stones.  The queen herself is a horror: Bette Davis as Elizabeth I and reconfigured as a bobble-head doll. Ms. Bonham Carter makes you hear the petulant child in her barbarism and the wounded woman too. She rocks the house and the movie." even though the character is a harridan clich̩ who smitten  with  her knave (Crispin Glover) and  clutching her power rules with a boom. (���Off with his head!�۝) She eventually dukes it out with her rival and sister the White Queen (Anne Hathaway gliding like an ice dancer) who enlists Alice�۪s help. There�۪s more including computer-generated flowers assorted 3-D  projectiles and the usual British actors earning their pay like the ���Harry Potter�۝ alumni Timothy Spall Alan Rickman and Imelda Staunton. Mr. Burton lavishes his attention on the little things in ���Wonderland�۝ ��� the perfectly drawn red heart painted on the center of the Red Queen�۪s mouth for instance ��� perhaps because nothing else claims his attention. He�۪s very bad with the awkward action scenes maybe because he�۪s embarrassed that they even exist." the character seems to have been calculated to invoke Heath Ledger�۪s Joker though at his amusing best the Hatter brings to mind a strung-out Carrot Top. But Mr. Depp doesn�۪t have much to do which he proves as he wildly flirts with the camera. The only time the character hooks you is in the shivery moment when his gaze turns predatory as he looks at Alice who every inch a Tim Burton Goth Girl from her corpselike pallor to her enervated presence presents a more convincing vision of death than of sex." potentially rich and frightening moment expectedly fades as fast as the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) which doesn�۪t leave you with much else to hold onto Alice included. Mr. Burton�۪s heroine is a wan figure to hang an entire world on and Ms. Wasikowska who�۪s a livelier truer presence in the forthcoming ���The Kids Are All Right �۝ barely registers among Mr. Burton�۪s clanging and the computer-generated galumphing.

a filmmaker who thrived under National Socialism and directed ���Jew S�_ss�۝ (���Jud S�_ss �۝ 1940) one of the Nazis�۪ most notorious anti-Semitic works. He was the only director of the Nazi era to be tried after the war for crimes against humanity. Twice found not guilty he directed nine more movies in the 1950s before dying in 1964 in a Capri villa with his wife and children by his side. He�۪s buried in a lovely cemetery with a smashing view of the Mediterranean." ���In the Shadow of My Films�۝ ��� is an exploration of the filmmaker his career under National Socialism and the children and other relatives who bear his name and with varying difficulty his legacy. Directed by Felix Moeller it weaves together generous archival material ��� home movies photographs and clips from ���Jew S�_ss�۝ ��� and original talking-head interviews with assorted Harlan family members including his son Thomas a fascinating figure who could easily be the subject of his own documentary." a niece of Harlan�۪s and the widow of Stanley Kubrick. Her brother Jan Harlan produced several of Stanley Kubrick�۪s films and was an executive producer for Steven Spielberg�۪s ���A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.�۝)" in 1933 Joseph Goebbels the Nazi minister for  ���Enlightenment and Propaganda �۝ used his first address to representatives of the German film industry to enthuse about Sergei Eisenstein�۪s ���Battleship Potemkin �۝ the 1925 tour de force that features the oft-copied Odessa steps sequence with its runaway baby carriage. After admirably noting the film�۪s aesthetic quality Goebbels said that it proved that ���a work of art can very well accommodate a political alignment and that even the most obnoxious attitude can be communicated if it is expressed through the medium of an outstanding work of art.�۝" Goebbels is said to have watched at least one movie a day and once gave Hitler 18 Mickey Mouse films as a Christmas present along with 30 other titles. (The F�_hrer Goebbels wrote in his diaries was ���very pleased.�۝) In his valuable history ���The Ministry of Illusion: Nazi Cinema and Its Afterlife �۝ Eric Rentschler argues that Goebbels who saw Hollywood as his leading competition envisioned himself as a German David O. Selznick. To that end Mr. Rentschler explains under the Reich ���film was to be artful and accessible not intellectual or esoteric.�۝ Directors would function as facilitators rather than auteurs." �۪�ʉ۝ which as it toggles between the political and the personal in a brief 99 minutes only ends up skimming the surface. But even the skimming is largely interesting and thought-provoking and of course very bleak ��� no more so than with the clips from the original ���Jew S�_ss �۝ which was conceived as a hate film and exploited as a weapon of murder. Opening in 1733 it tells the story of a Jewish money lender from the ghetto Joseph S�_ss Oppenheimer (Ferdinand Marian) who rises to power in W�_rttemberg (in what is southwestern Germany) where he gains control of the court taxes the population rapes a young married woman (who then drowns herself) and is finally executed." where it was excitedly received including by ��� in a dagger to the heart ��� the young reviewer and later director Michelangelo Antonioni.  (���If this is propaganda then we welcome propaganda.�۝) It was a hit with both Goebbels (���exactly what I had hoped for �۝ he wrote) and German audiences. According to Mr. Leiser it was also repeatedly shown to SS units before they went on missions against Jews and concentration camp guards also watched it. In his documentary Mr. Moeller partly lays out how ���Jew S�_ss�۝ was exploited as propaganda in an awkward sequence in which some Harlan relatives visit a museum exhibit in Stuttgart dedicated to the Harlan film which gives the documentary a new location but also brings to mind an elementary school field trip lecture included." Mr. Moeller directly engages if again not deeply questions about German mass guilt and the responsibility of succeeding generations. Unfortunately he also badly botches a section that addresses Harlan�۪s postwar insistence on his innocence by inserting a clip from ���Jew S�_ss�۝ in which the caged S�_ss declares his own virtue. The juxtaposition of Harlan with his most notorious character can be intellectually justified but Mr. Moeller needs more than a shock cut: he needs an argument." like Mr. Leiser: ���The death of the Jew S�_ss in Veit Harlan�۪s film is uncannily prophetic. His last words ��� ���I was only an obedient servant of my master�۪ ��� anticipate the position adopted by innumerable Nazi criminals big and small in the postwar trials.�۝" Ludolph Weyer; edited by Anette Fleming; music by Marco Hertenstein; produced by Amelie Latscha and Mr. Moeller; released by Zeitgeist Films.

�۝ one of those rare films in which the moral stakes are as insistent and thought through as the aesthetic choices there�۪s a scene  in which the lead character Malik travels to Paris to kill some men. The scene  reverberates with almost unbearable tension but is briefly punctured by a seemingly throwaway image: Seconds before he begins shooting thereby sealing his fate you see him catch sight of a pair of men�۪s shoes showcased like jewels in a boutique window in a rich Parisian quarter. He does a double take a reaction that might mirror that   of the anxious viewer who wonders why he doesn�۪t just get on with it." as well as  the surprise it elicits. He�۪s window shopping ��� doesn�۪t he have some killing to do? Yet these luxury items are resonant as is their exclusive setting and the way Malik�۪s admiring gaze momentarily stops the flow of the action: each adds another element to this portrait of an impoverished young Frenchman of Arab descent who is transformed in prison. Over the course of the film Malik will learn to read to smuggle to murder to survive. Which is why when he pauses after unloading his guns his pale face floating in the sanguineous  dark it looks as if he were emerging from a kind of womb: his metamorphosis is complete." whose talents have deepened with each new film. (His previous one ���The Beat That My Heart Skipped �۝ from 2005 is a superb remake of ���Fingers �۝ James Toback�۪s art-pulp thriller.) Like some other prison tales ���A Prophet �۝ which won the grand prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival has the flavor of the ethnographic. Its subject is an individual in a context and while Malik (Tahar Rahim a stealth presence) is the story�۪s focus he�۪s also part of an inquiry on power. When he first enters prison for a vague crime involving an assault he arrives as a relative innocent but more important to his trajectory he�۪s unschooled both as a criminal and a citizen." a ritualistic divesting (and humiliation) that the inmates and the prison system continue. He soon attracts the unwelcome attention of C̩sar Luciani (the tremendous Niels Arestrup) an old lion who rules over the Corsican gang that controls the prison including some guards. To protect his own C̩sar orders Malik to murder another prisoner Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi) also of Arab extraction. Without friends or affiliation Malik believes he has no choice and carries out the murder with a razor blade that he�۪s hidden inside his mouth and which he fumbles as the blood gushes over him his victim the walls." perhaps  because of Malik�۪s awkwardness or maybe it just takes a while to bleed to death.  At any rate it is a ghastly vision. But it isn�۪t simply the gore or Reyeb�۪s twitching body that make the scene difficult to watch: it�۪s the way the murder has been messily even frantically staged and filmed the two men thrashing inside a frame that can barely contain them. There is nothing exciting about the violence and there are no beauty shots of the pooling blood. Mr. Audiard effectively turns us into witnesses to a horrible crime though not in order to punish us for our ostensible complicity in the violence. He is instead I think insisting on the obscenity of murder." �۝ as is the way Mr. Audiard wants you to feel revolted  by the murder even as he encourages you to feel something else for Malik by showing for instance how his body continues to tremble after Reyeb�۪s has stopped shuddering. Mr. Audiard doesn�۪t sex up Malik�۪s crimes turning them into easily digestible spectacles the kind made to accompany a large popcorn and soda. But he doesn�۪t solicit our pity: Malik is guilty. Yet guilt is like a poisonous gas in this film it suffuses the prison permeating the guards�۪ rooms and the cells in which corrupt lawyers counsel their murderous clients and the larger world where politicians make decisions that send some to jail while freeing others." surrealism and spasms of weird comedy. Having killed for C̩sar he essentially surrenders to the Corsicans for whom he serves a second parallel sentence and who reward him with racist contempt. C̩sar keeps Malik busy running errands which allows Mr. Audiard to take him (and us) all across the prison and sometimes outside of it. This expands the story and Malik�۪s horizon as do some other prisoners Ryad (Adel Bencherif) and Jordi (Reda Kateb). Every so often Mr. Audiard slows the film down and blacks out some of the image so we can linger on a detail as if to remind us to really look at what we�۪re watching." there is room for diverging even contradictory interpretations and the political certainly is as much at play here as the Oedipal. Mr. Audiard for his part working from a screenplay he wrote with several others avoids speeches that explain everything and instead opts for a materialist approach that attends to the realities of prison life showing how guards and porters deliver the prisoners�۪ food (baguettes!) and how Malik as he shakes off C̩sar�۪s grip helps distribute illicit drugs." Mr. Arestrup who played the thuggish father in ���The Beat That My Heart Skipped �۝   initially dominates ���A Prophet �۝ boring into the story with unnerving small gestures and the force of his presence. He�۪s playing another patriarch in this film of course the kind who rules small worlds with cruelty. With his overcoats bulky frame and proud carriage he can bring to mind the later-life Jean Gabin though Mr. Arestrup�۪s terrifying smile quickly snuffs out such nostalgic thoughts. C̩sar is not a figure of sentimentality. Among other things he is a businessman and the cold-bloodedness with which he wields his power might be a matter of personal depravity. It also serves his bottom line." Mr. Rahim�۪s performance sneaks up from behind. With his wispy mustache and a body that scarcely fills his clothes Malik makes an unlikely center for such a thrilling film.  The camera doesn�۪t love him no matter how closely it hovers. But  Malik was not meant for our love and Mr. Rahim�۪s performance while  strong is purposefully  not flashy as movie outlaws often are. Mr. Audiard seems to be after something else and in ���A Prophet�۝ he shows us the truth of another human being who might otherwise escape from our sight because he is too foreign or whom we might try to pity just to feel safe. But the world we make is not necessarily safe and neither are those  we leave alone to fight for their survival." based on an idea by Abdel Raouf Dafri and an original script by  Mr. Dafri and Nicolas Peufaillit; director of photography St̩phane Fontaine; edited by Juliette Welfling; music by Alexandre Desplat;  produced by Martine Cassinelli;  released by Sony Pictures Classics.

�۝ the gifted William Hurt who specializes in playing high-strung upscale neurotics brings his formidable skills to the character of Brett an itinerant oil rigger with a criminal record who as the story begins is released from a Louisiana prison after serving six years for manslaughter. The circumstances of the crime are only revealed in a flashback late in the film." and in certain shots his face reveals the flinty exterior of a hard-bitten Southern loner with low expectations who has endured some very tough times. But if Mr. Hurt gives a meticulously detailed performance he is still so innately refined that Brett never quite registers as an authentic blue-collar type either vocally or in his body language. Ultimately men like Brett are just not in Mr. Hurt�۪s DNA and you are left with the impression of observing a silk purse artfully (but only partially) disguised as a sow�۪s ear." �۝ adapted from an early-1970s story by Pete Hamill and moved to Louisiana bayou country in 2007 is directed by Udayan Prasad best known for his 1997 film ���My Son the Fanatic.�۝ In ���The Yellow Handkerchief�۝ Brett newly released from prison encounters two volatile insecure teenagers Gordy (Eddie Redmayne) and Martine (Kristen Stewart) who have themselves just met for the first time at a convenience store.

Although the movie barely sketches its characters�۪ backgrounds in Erin Dignam�۪s elliptical screenplay in little bursts of confession we learn that the mechanically adept Gordy is at least partly American Indian and feels he belongs nowhere. Because Mr. Redmayne is English attended Eton and often plays aristocrats (he was his mother�۪s sexually ambiguous incest victim in ���Savage Grace�۝) he is as far away from the geeky Southern loner he portrays in ���The Yellow Handkerchief�۝ as Mr. Hurt is from an oil rigger." working-class version of her character Bella in the ���Twilight�۝ movies.

Brett rewards her trust by imparting his hard-won practical wisdom when she needs it most." when he cajoles her to give him a friendly kiss that he pushes much too far too fast. The same happens early in Brett�۪s relationship with May when Brett mistakes her physical affection for lust and crudely gropes her." ���The Yellow Handkerchief�۝ is about how people read or misread each other�۪s signals. At various points Brett and May profess to be able to see each other�۪s histories in their faces.

Focusing on an F.B.I. investigation into the murder of Henry Wen (Joseph Forunda) a Taiwanese economics professor in Chicago the film is partly a tutorial on the tense relations among Taiwan (the island of Formosa) the Chinese mainland and the United States and partly a clumsy cloak-and-dagger political thriller." and maintains a ���one China�۝ policy. But the Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979 after the United States established diplomatic relations with Beijing pledges to help defend the island if it is attacked by the mainland. Because both Chinas are valuable trading partners with the United States it is a classic example of diplomacy that plays both ends against the middle." at which time China conducted missile testing near the island as a warning not to declare independence.

With his brother Sean (Kel O�۪Neill) Davy is tooling around on a book tour reading his unpublished prose to listeners who can barely rouse themselves to lift their hands in applause. One night after a particularly forlorn reading he answers the motel phone and encounters the woman of his wet dreams Nicole (Kathryn Aselton) who soon benefits from his affection for books in which throbbing is the verb of choice." but it soon becomes evident that she�۪s more interested in what lies beneath. The same is true of the first-time feature director Kyle Patrick Alvarez who based his screenplay on an article by Davy Rothbart that was originally published in GQ magazine.

You�۪re the closest I�۪ve ever had to a real girlfriend he confesses to Nicole a sentiment that might break your heart if you believed it for a second." but plausibility is not one of them.

At the heart of the movie energetically directed and  argued by Don Argott is the celebrated Barnes Foundation which houses a private collection  in suburban Philadelphia (here a city of brotherly love and loathing) groaning with European masterworks African sculptures Asian prints American Indian ceramics among other items. The foundation even owns a farmhouse furnished with decorative arts and its surrounding 12-acre arboretum is filled with rare flora from around the globe." though that has had curators academics journalists and politicians pointing fingers and crying foul in recent years: it�۪s the art especially the post-Impressionist and early Modernist paintings signed by the likes of C̩zanne Picasso Renoir Degas Manet Monet and Van Gogh. Amassed by a working-class striver turned collector named Dr. Albert C. Barnes (1872-1951) these paintings are the glittering prizes in the foundation that bears his name and that in total has been valued at more than $25 billion though the collection is sometimes breathlessly described as priceless. In his will Barnes stipulated that the collection was to remain in its original locale far from the reach of the Philadelphia elite he despised." wills challenged legacies dismantled. And in the years after Barnes�۪s death the collection became the focus of a fascinating fight among an array of interests. Much of the louder part of the battle involved its location: some wanted it to stay put thereby honoring Barnes�۪s wishes. Others wanted it moved to Philadelphia where it would be more accessible and of course could become a desirable lucrative tourist attraction. Mr. Argott wisely doesn�۪t pretend that any of this is a mystery: shortly after some introductory text he shows the former Philadelphia mayor John F. Street announcing the foundation�۪s planned relocation to the city joking how he had biked past the original site recently and waved ���See you soon.�۝" ���The Art of the Steal�۝ is nothing if not agenda-driven having been paid for by a former foundation student Lenny Feinberg who ��� to quote the movie�۪s notes ��� ���initiated funded and was intimately involved in the making of ���The Art of the Steal.�۪�ʉ۝ That partisanship helps explain the movie�۪s vibrancy and sense of urgency. Construction on a new central Philadelphia home for the foundation began last year and some galleries in the original building have already been closed for the expected move in 2012. Although a judge in 2008 refused to consider a request for a new hearing by opponents of the move the fight continues off the screen and now on." witty elegant tastemakers and cultural elites including Christopher Knight the art critic for The Los Angeles Times and Julian Bond the civil rights activist whose father once ran Lincoln University the historically black institution to which Barnes willed control of his foundation. Both Mr. Knight and Mr. Bond have interesting things to say about the collection its complex history and scandalous present. But because of how Mr. Argott has pieced together his movie or more precisely constructed his argument ��� pitting critics and curators against less persuasive figures like Pennsylvania�۪s bullish governor Edward G. Rendell ��� these distinctive voices soon blur." which could only strengthen the documentary saving it from caricature. At times the fight comes across as a smackdown between art snobs who want to preserve Barnes�۪s right to exhibit his masterworks however he wanted because well he paid for them (a curiously underexamined refrain) and vulgarians who want to turn his patrimony into tourist bait along with the Liberty Bell and an actor in a Ben Franklin getup. What remains unanswered finally is the larger question of whether deep  pockets ensure custodial rights forever." though Mr. Argott stacks the deck heavily and while his movie is like many documentaries these days overly indebted to Errol Morris (enough with the Philip Glass already) ���The Art of the Steal�۝ is often very fine. Serving as his own cinematographer and working with the editors Demian Fenton and Judah-Lev Dickstein Mr. Argott marshals a wealth of archival and new material expertly weaving interviews together with still photographs home movies television reports newspaper clippings and even charts. One weakness is the too-brief tantalizing peeks inside the Barnes. Yet like the movie as a whole this limitation comes with dividends: it made me want to hop on a plane to Philadelphia as soon as possible to see the original  before it�۪s emptied."

but it applies to the shallow boorish stock traders at Morgan & Morgan the fictional New York investment bank in Julio DePietro�۪s acidic romantic comedy ���The Good Guy.�۝ Shown last year at the Tribeca Film Festival just a few months after the economy�۪s near-collapse the movie may feel a little behind the curve. But it is fresh enough to provide the voyeuristic kick of glimpsing the frenzied lifestyle of aspiring masters of the universe at a time when unlimited greed was rewarded with unlimited opportunity. An alternate title might have been ���Wall Street Junior.�۝" high-rolling traders who revel in monetary and sexual deceit feels entirely authentic. Except for the reticent bookish Daniel (Bryan Greenberg) the ���good guy�۝ of the title the financial hotshots all male who work for an avaricious boss named Cash (Andrew McCarthy) speak the same barbarous language.

The last person to buzz receives a painful electric shock and the others nearly fall over laughing. The production notes state that the entire trading floor of Lehman Brothers came to a halt one afternoon when someone brought the game to work." or at least appear to be.

�۝ the latest from Roman Polanski suggests that all is grim and gray and perhaps even for naught. But this high-grade pulp entertainment is too delectably amusing and self-amused and far too aware of its own outrageous conceits to sustain such a dolorous verdict. The world has gone mad of course ��� this is a  Polanski  film ��� so all we can do is puzzle through the madness dodging the traps with our ironic detachment and tongue lightly in cheek." never named in the film is played by Ewan McGregor at his ing̩nue best. A writer for hire ��� his oeuvre is summed up by the vulgar wit of his latest effort about a magician ���I Came I Sawed I Conquered�۝ ��� the Ghost is tapped  for cleanup duties. The initial ghostwriter behind the unfinished memoirs of a former British prime minister Adam Lang (a superb Pierce Brosnan) has washed up dead on an American beach. The publisher wants a completed book and presumptive best seller and Lang an increasingly divisive figure at home and abroad needs the kind of tidying up that such a media event might provide. The Ghost an agreeable convenient blank slate (no family no history) seems the man for the job." who shares screenwriting credit with Mr. Polanski the film opens   under a menacing cloak of darkness that rarely rises. An abandoned car in the first shot leads to the first ghostwriter�۪s beached body being lashed by ocean waters  in Martha�۪s Vineyard a macabre setup that in turn leads to the Ghost receiving a thrashing in London as he�۪s insulted (by an editor who thinks he�۪s wrong for the job); bullied (by the publisher who wants a fast turnaround); and punched (by a mugger who snatches a manuscript mistaking it for Lang�۪s). By the time the Ghost meets Lang who�۪s holed up at Martha�۪s Vineyard he is as jumpy as the rest of us. (The film was largely shot in Germany.)" working with a striking wintry palette that at times veers into the near-monochromatic ��� the blacks are strong and inky the churning ocean the color of lead ��� he creates a wholly believable world rich in strange contradictions and ominous implications. Among the most initially confusing is Lang a professional charmer whose beaming smiles with their sinister undercurrent and fits of rage convey depths that the Ghost soon begins to plumb an endeavor that takes the shape of an investigation. This amateur sleuthing leads to unsurprising trouble including with Lang�۪s wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) a brainy beauty whose relationship with her husband holds  its own secrets and is transparently meant to invoke that between Cherie Booth and Tony Blair." especially as references to Iraq torture and the Central Intelligence Agency are folded into the mix and placard-waving protesters gather outside Lang�۪s hideaway. Fingers are pointed though sometimes it seems not only at Lang but also at Mr. Polanski who is under house arrest in Switzerland awaiting word on whether he will be sent back  to Los Angeles to face sentencing for having had sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. Certainly the shots of Lang�۪s detractors with their furiously distorted faces and accusatory placards (���guilty �۝ ���wanted�۝) gives the film an extra-cinematic tang though as with so much here it�۪s also evident that Mr. Polanski is having his fun." no matter how obvious the twists. Everything ��� including Alexandre Desplat�۪s score with its mocking light notes  and urgent rhythms suggestive of Bernard Herrmann ��� works to sustain a mood establish an atmosphere and confirm an authorial intelligence that distinguishes this film from the chaff. Unlike many modern Hollywood and Hollywood-style thrillers which seek to wrest tension from a frenzy of cutting and a confusion of camera angles Mr. Polanski creates suspense inside the frame through  dynamic angles and through the discrete choreographed movements of the camera and actors. He makes especially effective use of the enormous windows in Lang�۪s house through which the sky and ocean beckon and threaten." particularly when an artist ventures into the explicitly personal as he did in ���The Pianist �۝ his 2002 film about a musician who like him survived the Holocaust. But such interpretations can flatten poetry into prose and also serve as strategies to neuter artists whose works of imagination are ���revealed�۝ as nothing more than banal facts. This isn�۪t to deny the personal in art only an insistence on the elusiveness of creation. Mr. Polanski�۪s ventures into the horrific in films like ���Repulsion�۝ might have something to do with his history but they are also a matter of affinities inspirations attitudes competencies tastes pleasures." well that of Tony Blair which only means that there are amusing points of convergence. Tracing the lines between fact and fiction makes for a dandy parlor game one that Mr. Polanski obviously wants us to play at least for a while because such resonances have their rewards. They thicken the texture of the work even if they don�۪t define it. Such thickening might seem especially critical with material as thin as ���The Ghost Writer �۝ but these are the tools of a director working with every element at his disposal including a colorful miscellany of emoting popping memorable faces (notably those of Kim Cattrall Tom Wilkinson Eli Wallach and David Rintoul)." I imagine it will be easy for some to dismiss it. But the pleasures of a well-directed movie should never be underestimated. The image of Mr. Brosnan abruptly leaning toward the camera like a man possessed is worth a dozen Oscar-nominated performances. And the way when Lang chats with the Ghost ���  his   arms and legs open a drink in hand as if he were hitting on a woman ���  shows how an actor and his director can sum up an entire personality with a single pose. Mr. Polanski�۪s work with his performers is consistently subtle even when the performances seem anything but which is true of this very fine film from welcome start to finish." based on the novel by Mr. Harris; director of photography Pawel Edelman; edited by Herve de Luze; production designer Albrecht Konrad; music by Alexandre Desplat; produced by Mr. Polanski Robert Benmussa Alain Sarde and Timothy Burrill; released by Summit Entertainment.

that should be OFF THE COAST OF MASSACHUSETTS! IN 1954! since every detail and incident in the movie however minor is subjected to frantic almost demented (and not always unenjoyable) amplification. The wail of strangled cellos accompanies shots of the titular island a sinister rain-lashed outcropping that is home to a mental hospital for the CRIMINALLY INSANE! The color scheme is lurid and the camera movements telegraph anxiety. Nothing is as it seems. Something TERRIBLE is afoot." that something turns out to be the movie itself directed by Martin Scorsese and adapted by Laeta Kalogridis from a peculiar contraption of a thriller by Dennis Lehane. Like Shutter Island in the opening scenes the full dimensions of the catastrophe come into view only gradually. At first everything is fine or at least not quite right in a way that seems agreeably intriguing. Mr. Scorsese uses his considerable formal dexterity ��� his intimate comprehensive understanding of how sound and image work together to create meanings and moods ��� to conjure a tingly atmosphere of uncertainty and dread." who plays Teddy Daniels a United States marshal taking a ferry ride out to the island to investigate the disappearance of a patient. Mr. DiCaprio having grown perhaps overly fond of his accent from ���The Departed �۝ brings it along for the ride and it spreads through the movie like a contagious disease. Teddy�۪s partner (pahtnah) Chuck Aule played by Mark (Mahk) Ruffalo is supposed to be from the Pacific Northwest but he seems to have left all his R�۪s back in Seattle. Michelle Williams pops up in smudgy color-drenched memories and hallucinations as Teddy�۪s dead wife Dolores her intonations as thick and clammy as chowder." �۝ but are not the only voices heard on the grounds of the asylum where the patients perambulate like zombies and the orderlies lurk like vengeful specters. Ben Kingsley is Dr. Cawley the psychiatrist in charge with silky upper-crust menace in his voice and a diabolical little beard on his chin. Max von Sydow spouts Freudianisms in insinuating Germanic tones that remind Teddy ��� and of course not only Teddy ��� of Nazis an association that helps to induce gratuitous flashbacks of corpses stacked outside death-camp barracks." the status of which is one of the movie�۪s chief mysteries. There are many others besides. Intimations of conspiracy supernaturalism cold war shenanigans and a whole lot more float around in the atmosphere which is convulsed by operatically bad weather and the energetic furrowing of Mr. DiCaprio�۪s brow. As he interviews patients and staff members trying to figure out how a woman named Rachel Solando could have vanished barefoot from her cell Teddy is plagued by headaches bad dreams and paranoia. Everyone he talks to seems to be harboring a secret but what can it be?" which he claims are a humane advance over the cruelty and superstition of the past really a form of madness in their own right? And what about the strange coincidence that Shutter Island apparently houses the firebug who caused Dolores�۪s death?" the plot of which does not so much thicken as clog and coagulate. Mr. Scorsese ever resourceful draws on the influence of Alfred Hitchcock the master of carefully orchestrated psychological confusion and also nods in the direction of Mario Bava the Italian horror maestro whose gothic fantasias routinely assert the triumph of sensation over sense. Mr. Scorsese�۪s camera sense effectively fills every scene with creepiness but sustained gripping suspense seems beyond his grasp." as MacGuffins and red herrings spawn and swarm. But just when the puzzle should accelerate the picture slows down pushing poor Teddy into a series of encounters with excellent actors (Emily Mortimer Jackie Earle Haley Patricia Clarkson) who provide painstaking exposition of matters that the audience already suspects are completely irrelevant." with lugubrious deliberateness to pull out from under you. As the final revelations approach the stakes diminish precipitously and the sense that the whole movie has been a strained and pointless contrivance starts to take hold." of course those who will resist this conclusion in part out of loyalty to Mr. Scorsese a director to whom otherwise hard-headed critics are inclined to extend the benefit of the doubt. But in this case the equivocation the uncertainty seems to come from the filmmaker himself who seems to have been unable to locate what it is in this movie he cares about beyond any particular local formal concern. He has in the past used characters whose grasp of reality was shaky ��� or who stubbornly lived in realities of their own making ��� as vehicles for psychological exploration and even social criticism.

�۝ a comedy about the unhappy topic of family dysfunction the writer and director Mitchell Lichtenstein (���Teeth�۝) struggles to find the humor in a host of horrors including encroaching parental dementia. Unfortunately to judge from the many awkwardly handled passages Mr. Lichtenstein does not possess the requisite filmmaking skill or certainly the delicacy to balance the different often jarringly contrasting moods jokes and intimate revelations squeezed into this erratic belabored movie." outside of John Waters it is hard to think of a filmmaker who could finesse for yuks and yucks the image of Parker Posey as Jayne a twitchy art socialite dreamily wiping the excrement off the bared backside of her failing (oft-railing) father Joe (Rip Torn).

N.C. in 1970. The details of the case resemble those of many similar events that took place across the region at the height of the civil rights movement. A black man Henry Marrow was brutally killed and his accused murderers members of a family of white business owners were acquitted by an all-white jury as the town seethed and its leaders panicked. There were peaceful marches to the state capital and also acts of looting vandalism and arson." based on a book of the same title by Timothy B. Tyson a scholar of African-American history (and as a boy a character in the story) reminds us that such episodes did not end with the passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s. Early scenes emphasize that to many of its black residents Oxford a tobacco-growing hamlet not far from Durham seemed at the end of that decade to be frozen in a Jim Crow past. Whites might have agreed but found more cause for complacency than frustration." a son of a well-to-do local African-American family who has come home to teach school and later reopen his father�۪s restaurant is startled at how little appetite for change there seems to be. Meanwhile on the other side of town an idealistic minister takes up a post at the Methodist church and startles its all-white congregation with his rather moderate invocations of racial equality and his insistence on inviting a prominent black educator to speak at Sunday services." the preacher Vernon Tyson (who is the father of Timothy and who is played with amiable understatement by Ricky Schroder) would have been the hero of the story the white man whose awakened conscience drives history forward. But neither he nor  Mr. Chavis ��� who after the events depicted in the film would go on to become the executive director of the N.A.A.C.P. many years later ��� quite fills that role. They are both portrayed as thoughtful morally serious men but ���Blood Done Sign My Name�۝ is not really concerned with their inner struggles or psychological motivations." combined with the slow meandering pace of Mr. Stuart�۪s storytelling drains some of the intensity from the story. ���Blood Done Sign My Name�۝ has the mood and tone of a made-for-television drama dutifully explaining an important piece of history and at times the film�۪s ambitions stretch beyond its abilities. The cast is enormous and Mr. Stuart�۪s evident desire to respect the truth of the story in all its details leaves him without a clear emphatic dramatic structure." as an N.A.A.C.P. ���stoker�۝ sent to Oxford to help organize protests steals a hefty portion of the movie from the diffident Mr. Parker ��� means that the town of Oxford becomes both hero and villain. What the film lacks in psychological nuance it makes up for in unassuming intimate social observation." in particular Nick Searcy as Robert Teel the shopkeeper who with two of his sons killed Marrow shortly after he had returned home from Vietnam. But the place itself ��� its physical layout and especially the manners and speech patterns of its citizens ��� breathes with an unusually delicate sense of reality. Mr. Stuart himself a native of the Tarheel state takes his time over family meals informal parties and the everyday exchanges of news and courtesies that make up Southern life even in times of tumult. He also shows how racism rather than being the pathology of a few bad apples was woven into the fabric of daily existence." somewhat ungainly movie. But it is also rich and fascinating. At times you think you are watching a clumsy stage pageant superimposed on a documentary; it�۪s so stiff and yet at the same time so real. At one point the camera catches sight of an elderly gaunt black man with a sly smile and a twinkle in his eye who appears as an extra in one of the scenes and who may elicit a half-conscious ping of recognition. At the very end his image reappears and he is identified as John Hope Franklin the great historian to whom ���Blood Done Sound My Name�۝ is dedicated. Flawed though it may be as a work of cinema the film is as a piece of historical reconstruction a fitting tribute to his memory." based on the book by Timothy B.

or perhaps just sky and earth the pilgrims who walk and tremble and are sometimes pushed through ���Lourdes�۝ in wheelchairs are usually seen at a remove. One exception is Christine a young woman with  multiple sclerosis who is  played by the French actress Sylvie Testud. Tucked into a wheelchair her limbs immobile and hands tightly curled Christine looks around her ��� at the other visitors the helpful aides the strange locale ��� with a gaze that seems at once incurious and beatific." Lourdes is thought by Roman Catholics to have been where the impoverished 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous saw the Virgin Mary in 1858. She was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1933 and by Hollywood a decade later when her story was turned into the 1943 kitsch classic ���The Song of Bernadette �۝ with Jennifer Jones. Millions now visit Lourdes annually to attend services and drink from and bathe in the grotto waters thought to have healing powers. It�۪s been claimed that the water can cure though as the Lourdes Web site lourdes-france.org puts it: ���For a modern mentality it is difficult to say that something is ���inexplicable.�۪ They can only say that it is ���unexplained.�۪�ʉ۝" rigorously thoughtful somewhat sly film is that it takes place in the space between the inexplicable (no explanation is possible) and the unexplained (enlightenment might be around the corner). Its director Jessica Hausner an Austrian working here in French wants to explore  the mysteries of life not its certainties. One great mystery of course is faith itself how people come to believe what they do and how those beliefs affect not just their thinking and feelings but also their bodies. For Christine who speaks most profoundly through the eerie quiet of her nearly inert form ��� and then later through a possibly miraculous physical transformation ��� belief is inscribed on the body itself." which was shot on location in Lourdes ��� one scene features Cardinal Roger Mahony the archbishop of Los Angeles leading a prayer service ��� is largely organized around the rituals of pilgrimage. Christine who�۪s closely assisted by a young woman (L̩a Seydoux) who feeds and helps dress her is pushed here and there.  In one scene Christine visits the grotto her attendant lifting her curled hand to the stone wall. Another time she visits the baths where grotto water is poured on her head. In between she eats and sleeps and has encounters with others (including Bruno Todeschini and a very good Elina L̦wensohn).  Wherever she goes a shop selling religious souvenirs can usually be seen in the background." these repeated images of the souvenir shops don�۪t function as overt critiques and there�۪s nothing in the film as crude as an indictment of the commodification of faith. Ms. Hausner whose earlier titles include ���Lovely Rita �۝ is more interested in the forms that faith takes in its individual and collective ebbing and flowing. The mesmerizing opening image ��� a steadily framed and angled overhead shot of a cafeteria ��� immediately sets her parameters. As the camera holds on the image men and women some in wheelchairs begin to stream in as if carried along by some unseen force. They�۪re merely being seated for a meal but the elevated angle of the shot and the way everyone drifts in together as if each were part of a single organism creates a sense of a collective purpose a unified calling." among the other pilgrims including a few women who serve as something of a humble Greek chorus. Together they help make up a convincing world inhabited by believers and skeptics whose ideas are largely voiced in asides and through their actions. In a wonderfully choreographed bit a member of the Order of Malta a religious group tells a joke in which the Virgin Mary is the (mild) punch line. Meanwhile in the background Christine is secretly wheeled out the door  by her roommate an older woman with a lopsided mouth Mme.

�۝ an English squire turned actor turned howling moonstruck lycanthrope suffers from a vexing identity crisis and so does the movie. Lawrence Talbot the hairy hero broodingly played by Benicio Del Toro is torn between his human and his bestial impulses and this new version of the 1941 creature-feature classic struggles to stay true to its pulpy B-movie roots while fulfilling the commercial imperatives of a modern large-scale commercial entertainment." in close-up decked out in furry masks and Rick Baker�۪s makeup effects a hint of old-fashioned handmade horror style creeps into the film. The pickled Victorian production design (by Rick Heinrichs) and the smoky cinematography (by Shelly Johnson) cast an appropriately sinister pall enhanced by the growling and muttering of Anthony Hopkins who plays Lawrence�۪s shambling nutcase of a father." much of the Gothic fun leaks out of the picture which has already nearly drowned in viscera and gore. The implied violence of the original gives way to a literal-minded bloodbath with severed heads and limbs and lingering attention to the effects of lupine claws and teeth on human flesh. The climactic showdown resembles an extreme-fighting cage match conducted by a pair of rabid Wookies. Like much else in ���The Wolfman �۝ this scene is more likely to make you howl with laughter than whimper in fright. Which would be fine if you could convince yourself that laughter was the intended response." indulging a time-honored prerogative granted to slumming British actors allows himself an occasional twinkle of amusement as he delivers fatherly advice the gruesome import of which Lawrence will take much too long to figure out. But Mr. Del Toro broods and shivers in such earnest that you have no choice but to take him seriously. And Emily Blunt as Gwen the bereaved fianc̩e of Lawrence�۪s poor disemboweled brother Ben (Simon Merrells) widens her eyes and sets her lower lip to trembling with impeccable refinement just when a jolt of campy melodramatic excess is most needed." Joe Johnston (���Jumanji �۝ ���Jurassic Park III�۝) cannot seem to find the tone that would make ���The Wolfman�۝ work. The story is simple enough and should be foolproof. After Ben�۪s death Lawrence returns home from a long exile mostly in America to his windswept hometown Blackmoor in the North of England. There he exchanges cryptic unpleasantries with his dad and makes sad eyes at Gwen. Meanwhile a diabolical predator is on the prowl. The residents of Blackmoor are terrified and blame the local Gypsies. And then the Gypsy encampment is set upon by the vicious unseen (and therefore still scary) marauder." every time the moon is full he is transformed into a wolf in gentleman�۪s clothing. Thanks to an officious Scotland Yard inspector (Hugo Weaving) Lawrence is shipped off to a nasty asylum where in the film�۪s only truly memorable sequence he brutally debunks a doctor�۪s attempt to prove that werewolfism is a psychological delusion." she reasons then maybe ���magic is real and God is real.�۝" but ���The Wolfman�۝ spins in agnostic limbo neither fantastical enough to be thrilling nor realistic enough to be genuinely disturbing. The aural and visual trappings of horror are there ��� in Danny Elfman�۪s throbbing stabbing score and in a sound design replete with growls howls creaks and shrieks ��� but the dread never quite takes hold. Nor does the passion between Gwen and Lawrence that would have given this movie the frisson of romantic longing that seems to be a requirement for any respectable commercially ambitious monster movie in the age of ���Twilight.�۝" above all by those teenage vampires who generate such frenzy (and such profit) from their sexless passions. If Lawrence Talbot had only stayed in America he could have joined Team Jacob stripped off his shirt and found some solace for his divided soul. In the ���Twilight�۝ world his predicament ���animal hunger in perpetual conflict with human feeling ��� might have made a little more sense.

�۝ a queasy-funny and unapologetically biased look at the televisual world that the Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has created when it feels as if you were watching a transmission from another planet. A media mogul who has a monopoly hold on Italian television and was elected for a third term in 2008 Mr. Berlusconi helped put the boob (and lots of them) on the Italian tube and is often in the news himself for his political machinations outrageous observations ��� Mussolini sent people away on ���holiday�۝;  President Obama is ���suntanned�۝ ��� sexcapades and persistent charges of corruption." following a political rally a stranger fractured Mr. Berlusconi�۪s nose and broke some of his teeth with a statuette of a cathedral. The attacker apparently had a history of mental problems. Mr. Berlusconi now 73 has had a speedy recovery and the judge investigating the assault has demanded to see a report of the politician�۪s injuries.  On Wednesday The Financial Times reported that one of his closest advisers Guido Bertolaso who runs a government agency that deals with natural disasters and state events was being investigated on  corruption charges relating to building contracts for the 2009 G-8 conference in Italy. The investigation has led to the arrest of four people. And so it goes." �۝ which has been on the festival circuit since its premiere at the 2009 Venice Film Festival doesn�۪t cover these latest scandals and stories of course. (That would require a news feed.) Rather the director Erik Gandini who was born in Italy and studied film in Sweden (the movie was partly produced with Swedish television money) takes a longer more generalized view. Though Mr. Berlusconi himself ��� the man oligarch tabloid personality and plastic surgery victim ��� has undeniable entertainment value Mr. Gandini is more interested in what might be termed the Berlusconi effect. What he�۪s after is Mr. Berlusconi�۪s impact on Italian culture specifically those for whom celebrity is power. Which is why by accident or design ���Videocracy�۝ ends up holding a mirror to the larger world." Mr. Gandini ��� who also serves as the narrator ��� opens his story with a wacky blast from Italy�۪s cathode-ray past: a television call-in quiz show that featured masked women stripping whenever a contestant has a correct answer. According to Mr. Gandini the show was a succ̬s de scandale because factory workers were staying up late to watch it. (Though unmentioned the show emerged around the same time that Italy was being rocked by assaults by the Red Brigades a homegrown militant group that in 1978 kidnapped and assassinated a former prime minister Aldo Moro.) From this humble start Mr. Berlusconi found a television template for success: the fewer clothes women wore the more power he accrued." smiling and still stripping their ample cups running over. Some of these television ornaments are called veline (showgirls) and their existence says a lot about the uses of the female body in contemporary Italian culture and Mr. Berlusconi�۪s role in such exploitation. In ���Videocracy�۝ there�۪s a scene in which an assortment of women many wearing towering heels and strained smiles audition as veline on a small stage in what appears to be a mall surrounded by a clapping seemingly approving audience of shoppers. Last November Time reported that a poll of girls in Milan said that being a velina was their top choice of profession. And no wonder: Mara Carfagna Mr. Berlusconi�۪s minister for equal opportunities is a former velina." individually and collectively is a fascinating element in his rise to power and easily could have consumed all of ���Videocracy.�۝ You get a sense of that relationship during a stunning campaign commercial that Mr. Gandini includes ��� as a researcher he digs through the dirt like a truffle pig ��� in which different women sing the praises of the prime minister from the supermarket to the swimming pool. (���Thank God Silvio exists!�۝) It might have been useful if Mr. Gandini had talked to some women less enamored with the prime minister but because he isn�۪t pretending to be objective or a journalist he doesn�۪t really present both sides of the argument. He obviously doesn�۪t believe two exist." Ricky Canevali who dreams of finding television fame through a combination of martial arts and singing. However representative of the average star-struck Italian he is too modest a figure on which to hang the aspirations of a nation. Far more persuasive (and mesmerizing and repellent) is the extensive face time that Mr. Gandini scored with figures who loom large in the pop cultural scene: Lele Mora a talent agent and F.O.B. (Friend of Berlusconi) who is also a self-professed Mussolini admirer and Fabrizio Corona the so-called king of the paparazzi who was recently imprisoned for trying to extort money from some of his celebrated subjects." Power and Patrimony �۝ Paul Ginsborg a history professor at the University of Florence quotes a Berlusconi associate who explained: ���Television was profoundly congenial to Berlusconi�۪s character. It inspired him because of the speed with which he could put into practice the ideas that went through his head. I�۪d go further: television is Berlusconi.�۝ Mr. Ginsborg continues ���This symbiotic relationship with the medium of television is fundamental to our understanding of the man.�۝ Given the stakes it�۪s hard not to wish that Mr. Gandini had been more ambitious: at 85 minutes ���Videocracy�۝ can only scratch the surface. Even so after watching it you realize that even a cursory look at Mr. Berlusconi is crucial to understanding an age in which celebrity is now the coin of the realm."

�۝ which is neither romantic nor remotely comedic is that it makes you appreciate and long for the breeziness acting and basic competency ��� the decent lighting focused cameras and choreographed action ��� of ���Love Actually �۝ the ingratiating British movie it transparently and ineptly rips off. What else?

One man pops the question with his heart on his sleeve while another two-times his way through separate sets of sheets. The women meanwhile sigh and smile in and out of their clothes." while Jennifer Garner plays a schoolteacher who drives a car that costs about half of what her character probably earns in a year. Together with the rest of the cast they live in a Los Angeles rich in old-school stereotypes (fat people are good for jokes as are ethnic types with strong accents) leavened by some new-age attitudes. One story thread for instance follows a gay man who comes out with dignity if also with the usual cheap jokes: I�۪m right with you someone says just not behind you." but this one comes with a contemporary spin because every performer seems to have been tapped for a niche demographic perhaps to reflect today�۪s fractured entertainment world. There are two dreamy doctors from ���Grey�۪s Anatomy�۝ (Mr. Dane and Patrick Dempsey) for fans of that series. The ���Twilight�۝ set can thrill to Mr. Lautner. Country-music lovers might be happy to know that Taylor Swift makes her first and quite possibly last big-screen appearance here. Maxim readers have two Jessicas Alba (not bad) and Biel (not good) to pant after as well as Ms. Garner who flashes her tight end. Movie lovers meanwhile can sigh at Ms. MacLaine and remember the good old glamorous days." Julia  Roberts serves the same function. Although she barely has anything to do other than shove a lump down your throat during her shamelessly opportunistic segment she plays an interesting extra-cinematic role in ���Valentine�۪s Day�۝ just by being the only genuine movie star in it. (Ms. MacLaine has emeritus status while Mr. Foxx�۪s stardom flickers more than beams.)

Percy Jackson (the blandly appealing Logan Lerman) discovers that his high school classics teacher Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan) is also a centaur. The film�۪s man-horse hybrid is one of its most amusing creations." the man in charge of this unwieldy fusion directed the first two Harry Potter movies and so he knows the territory. But he clomps across it with a fairly heavy tread. Craig Titley�۪s screenplay doesn�۪t try to reconcile cleaned-up contemporary teenage argot with the deities�۪ verbal grandiosity; the gods�۪ pomposity though relatively restrained still has an oratorical ring. Almost all the conversation among the adolescents comes across as flat and mechanical no matter how many ���cools�۝ are inserted." in which virginal teenagers do battle with fire-belching monsters belongs to the same family-friendly genre as the ���National Treasure�۝ films. Although the standard allegorical bases for mythical-quest movies are dutifully covered the obvious similarity of ���Percy Jackson�۝ to the Harry Potter movies inevitably makes it feel somewhat secondhand." a dyslexic high school student (in the book he is only 12) discovers that he is the son of Poseidon. Wrongly suspected by Zeus (Sean Bean) of stealing the lightning bolt required to wield absolute power Percy embarks on a quest to retrieve it and clear his name in time to forestall a world-destroying war among the gods. At the very least the movie serves as a crisply outlined tutorial on Greek mythology." ���Percy Jackson�۝ is agreeably tame and unthreatening. The movie�۪s generic CGI monsters represent no technological advance. Such creatures are so prolific nowadays that even this movie�۪s hounds of hell elicit a ho-hum response. Maybe the advent of the 3-D era can help restore the scare factor." whose bedraggled earthly mother Sally (Catherine Keener) is kidnapped and imprisoned in Hades much of the journey is a cross-country treasure hunt to retrieve the blue pearls that will enable him and his fellow travelers to exit hell safely after they liberate her. His compatriots are Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) the saucer-eyed daughter of Athena and Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) a wisecracking satyr (a man-goat hybrid) who is Percy�۪s designated protector." a proud little smirk on his face his goat horns have finally sprouted. That�۪s as sexually suggestive as the movie gets. Throughout the film Percy is observed from on high by his father (Kevin McKidd) who at stressful moments offers advice and encouragement in a booming voice." a place festooned with statues of those whom she has turned to stone for daring to gaze into her eyes. Clad in black leather and wearing dark glasses Ms. Thurman�۪s Medusa is chilly but by no means terrifying. Next stop is the Parthenon in Nashville where the security guards metamorphose into a hydra with whom the teenagers do battle. In Las Vegas where a blue pearl is found lodged in a roulette wheel they linger for nearly a week in the Lotus Hotel and Casino where the hostesses dispense memory-erasing lotus-flower canap̩s and showgirls swarm over Grover. It�۪s the movie�۪s most fully realized sequence." which is not a mountain in Greece but an imposing edifice suspended above the Empire State Building.

�۝ the quiet and confident feature debut of the Israeli director Haim Tabakman explores the conflict between sexual desire and religious obligation. Set in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Jerusalem the film written by Merav Doster gives nearly equal weight to both sides in that struggle. It does not sensationalize lust or treat piety with condescension but rather treats these two basic often antithetical human impulses with respect and compassion. Faith can console as well as constrict and sex can bring confusion along with intimacy and pleasure." who runs a butcher shop he has inherited from his recently deceased father and who is proud to be recognized in his community as a tzaddik:  a righteous man. Aaron�۪s life is circumscribed by work prayer and family and he takes his duties in all three areas seriously." responsible and somewhat melancholy man who makes his way each day without complaint from his shop to the synagogue to the apartment he shares with his wife Rivka (Tinkerbel) and their four children." looking for refuge in a downpour. It turns out that he also needs a job and a place to stay and though he looks like someone who belongs in Aaron�۪s world there is something odd even threatening about him. Aaron�۪s charitable impulse is aroused ��� helping this lost soul will be a blessing ��� but so are other feelings. Perhaps he does not notice the spark of erotic interest that passes between him and this stranger or perhaps at least at first he regards it as a temptation to be conquered." at times almost ecstatic intimacy and the film takes note of the fine line in a rigorously gender-segregated society that separates the acceptable from the forbidden." and then more ardently ��� ���Eyes Wide Open�۝ also examines the ways an insular highly religious social order enforces its rules and norms of behavior. ���Modesty squads�۝ of young men take it upon themselves to threaten and sometimes enact violence and ostracism on anyone who strays and the specter of their vigilantism helps gentler authority figures like the local rabbi maintain control." a willing participant in this system knows the danger he is courting and finds himself caught in a terrible dilemma an identity crisis with no easy resolution.

dark pitiless world in misery. By the time the third movie finishes some half dozen young  girls will have been murdered along with more than a dozen women. Men will have died as well tormented by other men wearing smiles and sneers and wielding fists drills lighted cigarettes the usual guns and even a rat that ends splattered against a wall." titled ���Nineteen Seventy-Four �۝ is an explicit nod to George Orwell�۪s ���Nineteen Eighty-Four�۝ and its infamous rodent of terror. The title of Mr. Peace�۪s book and the quartet as a whole �� the other titles are ���Nineteen Seventy-Seven �۝ ���Nineteen Eighty�۝ and ���Nineteen Eighty-Three�۝ �� work as an obvious point of connection with that Orwell masterpiece though there are more similarities notably an enveloping sense of dread and a criminal gang that maintains its grip on the population through sadistic violence all faithfully reproduced in the movies. Throw Irish hunger strikers and Thatcherism into the mix and set the whole thing in Yorkshire the northern county birthplace of certain puddings and terriers and apparently endless horror. Stir." who has contributed to a few films by Terry Gilliam including ���Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas �۝ and so has an acquaintance with excess. And the three movies each directed by a different filmmaker for a combined 305 minutes are nothing if not extreme: along with all the female corpses and the dead and wounded men there are off-screen miscarriages multiple instances of child abuse intimations of incest a firebombed house and several cremations all shot from inside the chamber no less as if the camera were perched in the pyre. Shortly after the first film opens the main character attends a wake. The second movie ends in a cemetery. There�۪s a wedding but it looks like a downer." the ���Red Riding�۝ trilogy is the latest in an estimable line of crime entertainments from across the pond like the ���Prime Suspect�۝ cycle with Helen Mirren as a supremely human detective and the more recent mini-series  ���Five Days �۝ about a missing mother. The trilogy�۪s pulp-literary pedigree one further buffed by several high-profile festival showings �� last October it played in the New York Film Festival where it was presented rather hopefully as ���one of this year�۪s great cinematic events�۝ �� partly explains why it is being released in theaters in America. Starting on Friday the movies will play back to back with intermissions for a week at the IFC Center in New York. Thereafter they will be shown separately and also open elsewhere. (They�۪re already available on video on demand in some areas.)" the trilogy affords a fairly familiar immersion in contemporary British cinematic miserablism where men and terror run wild and beauty exists only in the cinematography and some of the performances. All else is horror. Certainly that�۪s true in the trilogy which starting with ���Red Riding: 1974 �۝  leaps into the void when a young Yorkshire journalist Eddie Dunford (Andrew Garfield not up to the leading-man task) realizes that the murder of a girl might be connected to a few earlier deaths an insight that finds him first chasing after clues and then being chased in turn. The director Julian Jarrold  shot the film in Super 16 millimeter which gives the images atmospheric grit and swirling grain that with the almost comically ubiquitous cigarette smoke nicely thickens the air." ���Red Riding: 1980 �۝ glossed up with 35-millimeter film and directed by James Marsh with an elegant self-conscious visual style at odds with the grunge milieu and desperate crimes �� dead bodies are as attractively framed as some clouds reflected in a window  �� pivots on Peter Hunter (a solid Paddy Considine).  An outsider brought into Yorkshire to conduct an internal review of the police investigation of the so-called (true life) Yorkshire Ripper murders Hunter soon enough becomes the hunted. At the same time a local detective Maurice Jobson (David Morrissey) who appears in the background of the first movie steps closer to the center while a clergyman Martin Laws (Peter Mullan) edges further into view. Both men become focal points in the final movie." the violence keeps the action hopping and you occasionally gagging either in revulsion at its severity or at the tender loving care with which it has been art directed. Meanwhile some of the actors notably Mark Addy who plays a lawyer unkindly named Piggott in the third movie and Rebecca Hall who plays a grieving mother in the first firmly hold your attention which is striking given that the story�۪s totalizing worldview doesn�۪t allow for much variation in human behavior. In a universe populated by victims and victimizers there is screaming and shouting but no joy little laughter barely any pleasure: when Piggott tells a joke it proves more of a jolt than any death because it�۪s comparatively rare." there is some enjoyment for the viewer who can admire how different characters melt in and out of the trilogy gaining and fading in importance as supporting players in one movie become the star attractions in the next and vice versa. A relatively minor player in the first film for instance a male hustler B J (Robert Sheehan) steps forward in the second chapter only to jump into the spotlight in the third becoming a force of change an intermittent narrator and (weak) voice of conscience. Several members of the police force remain constants including two professional sociopaths Bob (an excellent terrifying Sean Harris) and Tommy (Tony Mooney)." you will be treated to further brutal displays now in digital as Anand Tucker the director of the third movie ���Red Riding: 1983 �۝  attempts to tie up the ragged ends through the combined efforts of B J Maurice and Piggott who each hurtle down to their own private hells  via flurries of flashbacks. Although Mr. Tucker brings welcome warmth and unexpected humor to the series (thanks mainly to Mr. Addy) he stumbles badly when after a teasing buildup he reveals the marble-white body of a murdered girl who while grossly disfigured also looks as beautiful as a carved Della Robbia angel. The murderer has turned her ravaged body into an aesthetic exhibit an assault Mr. Tucker mimics." though it�۪s easier to watch at home where the remote offers fast relief from a grim fiction that with its murky palette and unyielding cruelty serves up a nihilistic vision that is unyielding hermetic unpersuasive and finally self-indulgent. What matters most in the books is Mr. Peace�۪s scatting prose and imaginative hijacking of real tragedies for his Grand Guignol fantasies which brings to mind James Ellroy (���L.A. Confidential�۝) but danker and without the obvious glee that Mr. Ellroy takes in his own work. What matters in the movies are some of the performances and the slickly packaged sadism. Nothing else on screen is at stake certainly not life or hope." a year after Britain declared war on Nazi Germany Orwell wrote that ours was a ���shrinking world�۝ in which the ����ʉ��democratic vistas�۪ have ended in barbed wire.�۝ In the ���Red Riding�۝ movies that world has shrunk to the size of a pebble: it�۪s hard unblemished by variation and very very small. And the democratic vistas aren�۪t behind barbed wire: they�۪re nonexistent which makes for entertaining nightmares but not dreams." �۝ Orwell continued ���less and less emphasis on the cradle endlessly rocking more and more emphasis on the teapot endlessly stewing. To accept civilization as it is   practically means accepting decay. It has ceased to be a strenuous attitude and become a passive attitude �� even ���decadent �۪ if that word means anything.�۝" adapted from the novels by David Peace; director of photography Rob Hardy; edited by Andrew Hulme; music by Adrian Johnston; production designer Cristina Casali; produced by Andrew Eaton Anita Overland and Wendy Brazington; released by IFC Films.

His universe is a place where comfort and pain are hard to tell apart because they both elicit tears. And tears are always the goal. In Mr. Sparks�۪s novels of which there are now 15 impossible star-crossed loves often shadowed by illness and death have an odd way of producing happy or at least blissfully cathartic endings. He is a master of the feel-good weepie a form of mass-market deep-tissue massage." �۝ the latest attempt to bring his warm earnest therapeutic sensibility to the screen falls in the upper middle range of Sparks film adaptations. If it lacks the epic sweep and extravagant emotionalism of ���The Notebook�۝ ��� Oh Ryan and Rachel! Oh James and Gena! ��� it also is free of the creepy piety and watered-down eros of ���A Walk to Remember.�۝ In the hands of director Lasse Hallstrom a blue-chip hack with a sure touch even when he�۪s slumming for a paycheck this story of interrupted passion takes on a ripe summery glow." which is the Carolina coast in seasons when the days are warm and sudden rainstorms invite al fresco kissing.

John is not exactly from the wrong side of the tracks but he has a vague history of trouble-making and a bit of a chip on his shoulder (and it�۪s quite a shoulder by the way). He was raised by his father (the always-excellent Richard Jenkins) an obsessive coin collector who Savannah believes has a form of autism." which is fairly mild even though it leads to a couple of guys getting punched out. One of them is Tim (Henry Thomas) a family friend of Savannah�۪s who is rearing an autistic son by himself. The punch is an accident and he is quick to forgive John whose mumbling diffident demeanor is as disarming as his physique is imposing." John is on leave from the Army Special Forces and when he goes overseas for what he thinks will be the last year of his enlistment they vow to keep in touch writing old-fashioned pen-and-ink letters and gazing at the moon.

�۝ one of the five Oscar nominees for best foreign-language film takes its name from a rough neighborhood in Jaffa a mostly Arab city just south of Tel Aviv. This particular urban conflict zone may be unfamiliar to most American viewers but it bears a definite kinship to mean streets we know very well at least from movies and television. Crime is endemic bonds of family and friendship can be both sustaining and fatal and the urge to escape is no match for the gravitational pull of the place itself." imperiled children; restless young guys in love with beautiful unattainable women; honorable thieves; dirty cops; and powerful men who dwell on both sides of the law. The possibility of violence hovers over even apparently benign encounters. Guns are drawn blood is shed and the drive to do the right thing usually ends in tragedy. We could almost be in the Los Angeles of ���Colors�۝ or ���Boyz N the Hood �۝ the Baltimore of ���The Wire�۝ or the Rio de Janeiro of ���City of God.�۝" and the universal race for money love and power is always run on a local course. The petty machinations of the police drug dealers and influence peddlers in ���Ajami�۝ unfold in a context of political conflict and communal mistrust. Written and directed by Scandar Copti an Israeli Arab (who also plays an important supporting role) and Yaron Shani who is Jewish the film is acutely insightful about the social divisions within Israel but it examines them without scolding or sentimentality." and no group hugging either. Instead there is a sharp sense of just how deep and wide the schisms are not just between Jews and Arabs but also between Christians and Muslims rich and poor farmers and city dwellers men and women young and old  and so on." �۝ a tough and in many ways unsparing movie is its deep immersion in the beats and melodies of everyday life in Jaffa and beyond. The large cast consists mainly of nonprofessional actors for whom the locations are home and their earnest diffident performances combine with a ground-level on-the-move shooting style to give the film an extraordinary  immediacy. Some of the scenes as they unwind slowly and take surprising turns have the rough surprising rhythm of a documentary." though the film has an ingenious and carefully worked-out structure. Dividing their story into chapters that are presented out of chronological order the filmmakers embrace the multi-stranded decentered narrative strategy that has become one of the prevalent conventions of contemporary world cinema. There are no coincidences only hidden connections among apparently random events some of which happen more than once so that the deeper patterns can be revealed." 13 and his older brother Omar (Shahir Kabaha) a big-boned sweet-natured young man are caught up in it. Trying to protect himself and his family Omar winds up in debt to Abu Elias (Youssef Sahwani) a local restaurant owner who is the de facto mayor of the neighborhood and the father of Hadir (Ranin Karim) whom Omar dreams of marrying. Elias is a man whose acts of generosity always come with a catch and you fear for anyone under his wing including a teenager named Malek (Ibrahim Frege) whose mother is gravely ill and who sneaks in from the West Bank to work in the restaurant." ���Ajami�۝ uses the genre as a way of exploring the conditions in which its characters live as well as their psychological complexities." a brute and a bully on the job is devoted to his children and is anguished about the fate of his younger brother a soldier who has apparently been kidnapped by Palestinian militants. He is to some extent a mirror image of Omar driven to do terrible things because of a volatile mixture of panic rage and family feeling." given how much messy vibrant and difficult life has been woven into two hours.

the appealing would-be couple at the center of ���When in Rome �۝ to find bliss together. And it goes without saying that they will. This is a romantic comedy after all and no genre is more reliable in its outcome. But if that foreordained result ��� in this case an Italian wedding at the end to echo the one where Nick and Beth met cute at the beginning ��� is going to be satisfying there need to be obstacles along the way. Nothing too serious or painful of course but an inkling of trouble sufficient to convince us that the happy ending has been properly earned." ���frantic and dispiriting�۝ is pretty high praise for a romantic comedy in these lovelorn times.) There are slapstick gags that fizzle and misfire as when Ms. Bell tries to smash a vase or when she squirts breath-freshener spray in Mr. Duhamel�۪s eyes or when he falls and bumps into things. There are dull stabs at verbal wit that leave you baffled bored or slightly grossed out." �۝ says Danny DeVito playing an encased-meat mogul who is one of Nick�۪s rivals for Beth�۪s affection.

Mr. DeVito is one of a gaggle of goofballs desperately smitten with Beth because she plucked some coins out of a fountain in Rome. This caused lightning to strike and those guys to fall in love with her. But Beth thinks that she also extracted one of Nick�۪s poker chips and must spend the movie fleeing from a set of unworthy suitors while fretting that the worthy one�۪s love is not real but rather magical." storybook charm of ���Enchanted �۝ this pixie-dusted idea might work a little better. Instead the Fountain of Love hocus-pocus messes up the tone of the movie as Beth must contend with some borderline-creepy stalkerish behavior from the various Mr. Wrongs. (The fountain itself at least gives Ms. Bell an opportunity to take off her shoes.) Jon Heder as a goofy street magician is the funniest of the bunch. The others are a moonstruck artist (Will Arnett) and a model (Dax Shepard) so obsessed with his own beauty that his attraction to Beth confuses him." where their beloved works as a curator at the Guggenheim Museum whose architecture is at least spared the abuse it suffered in ���The International.�۝ In the most lazy and perfunctory way imaginable the film pegs Beth as a high-strung workaholic a trait offered as explanation for her single state." but her worry about the authenticity of his love exposes an unacknowledged sadness that if faced head-on would have made ���When in Rome�۝ a much more affecting movie. Beth seems to believe that she doesn�۪t deserve to be loved without supernatural intervention. Her need for reassurance is disarming and also more than ���When in Rome�۝ can handle." it lurches along making Ms. Bell and Mr. Duhamel look duller than they need to. As for the rest of us our minds wander from what is supposed to be the movie�۪s burning question ��� will Beth and Nick find  bliss? ��� to other matters.

This involves showing up at various people�۪s houses and places of work accosting them with brusque questions and when all else fails punching them in the face." which is of course why people buy tickets to a movie like this one. And the director Martin Campbell manages until matters turn completely bloody and preposterous in the third act to inject a few subtle touches. The best thing about ���Edge of Darkness�۝ in the early going is its atmosphere of hushed pervasive menace. Or maybe that�۪s the second-best thing: the movie�۪s chief pleasure is an enigmatic narratively superfluous fellow named Darius Jedburgh played with world-weary wit by Ray Winstone." Mr. Winstone improves every movie he is in. Jedburgh who fancies  fine wine and good cigars is a shadowy fixer whose loyalties are uncertain and whose connections go all the way to the top. This means both the United States government and Emma�۪s employer Northmoor whose C.E.O. is immediately marked as a villain by dint of being played by Danny Huston." who incites a riot of Bay State braying from one end of the Mass Pike to the other.

The original ���Edge of Darkness �۝ which I have not seen was informed by the nuclear anxieties (and anti-nuclear activism) of its time and a shadow of this topical concern lingers around Emma Craven�۪s death. She is described as a corporate whistle blower who also had dealings with an underground group of environmentalist anti-corporate militants evocatively called Nightflower." trying some kind of Brahmin patois in contrast to Mr. Gibson�۪s blue-collar inflections) ���Edge of Darkness�۝ has no politics beyond the usual contest between the aggrieved little guy and the suit-wearing fat cats who think they can get away with anything but don�۪t know whom they�۪re dealing with." of course. Way back when ��� in the days of ���The Road Warrior�۝ and the first few ���Lethal Weapon�۝ pictures ��� Mr. Gibson brought a wild unpredictable streak to his action-hero persona.

�۝ a movie about a medical breakthrough is not especially eager to break new ground of its own. Directed with care and competence by Tom Vaughan (���What Happens in Vegas�۝) the film hews closely to familiar themes and patterns. One strand is a drama about a family in crisis with parents facing the illness and possible death of two of their children who suffer from a fatal genetic disorder. Another piece is a buddy picture in which a mismatched pair of guys ��� one earnest and emotive (Brendan Fraser) the other gruff and solitary (Harrison Ford) ��� set off on an unlikely adventure hoping to find a cure." and more unusually the film adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from a nonfiction book by the journalist Geeta Anand is an examination of how medical research is conducted and financed. This is the main reason that ���Extraordinary Measures �۝ the first feature released by CBS Films rises above some of its made-for-TV trappings. (The presence of established big-screen stars doesn�۪t hurt either.)" and the big scenes arrive punctually and are played with minimal nuance. But the dogged unflashy presentation of emotionally charged complicated material works to the film�۪s advantage. The lump-in-the-throat elements take care of themselves ��� the sight of sweet and lively children in hospital beds has a way of opening up audience tear ducts even without swelling musical cues ��� but the startling thing about ���Extraordinary Measures�۝ is not that it moves you. It�۪s that you feel at the end that you have learned something about the way the world works." his eternal boyishness comfortably expanding in a pudgy 40-something frame plays John Crowley a midlevel executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb whose two younger children a son and a daughter suffer from a rare inherited form of muscular dystrophy called Pompe�۪s disease. (The oldest son played by Sam M. Hall is unaffected)." Aileen (Keri Russell) do their best to give Megan (Meredith Droeger) and Patrick (Diego Velazquez) who use wheelchairs and breathing tubes a normal life with bowling alley birthday parties and trips to the beach. After the rest of the family has gone to bed John rifles through scholarly journals and trawls the Internet searching for some inkling of a cure and wondering how much time Megan and Patrick have left." a University of Nebraska professor played with sublime cantankerousness by Harrison Ford (and a composite character based on several scientists portrayed in Ms. Anand�۪s book). Motivated by sheer scientific curiosity and impelled by a stubborn go-it-alone work ethic Stonehill thinks he has isolated an enzyme that has the potential to arrest the progress of Pompe�۪s disease which usually kills its victims at the age of 8 or 9." resisted by Stonehill to sell out to a big biotechnology firm in Seattle)." along with the pursuit of the treatment that will save Megan and Patrick is what holds ���Extraordinary Measures�۝ together. This is not to say that the movie is a bloodless scientific procedural. Crowley�۪s visits home and Ms. Droeger�۪s adorable spunkiness prevent that. But the film resists the temptation to turn into a full-blown family melodrama. There are tensions and stresses between John and Aileen but they also deal with an awful situation in the matter-of-fact practical way that loving parents often do and the film is all the more moving because for the most part it understates their grief and anxiety." though of course there are the requisite scenes of seething and shouting and storming in and out of offices. The desperate father�۪s impatience is often at odds with the scientist�۪s detachment but ���Extraordinary Measures�۝ is ultimately about how feeling and objectivity can work together and also about how the protocols of medical research and development can both enable and obstruct progress." the filmmakers don�۪t suggest that he�۪s entirely wrong. Nor do they offer a simplistic account either scolding or celebratory of the relationship between big money and medical progress. The result while nothing extraordinary is nonetheless satisfying." based on the book ���The Cure�۝ by Geeta Anand; director of photography Andrew Dunn; edited by Anne V.

culled from the pages of history and full of present-day topical resonance. In the wake of personal tragedy and in the throes of illness and apprehension Charles Darwin (Paul Bettany) organizes decades of thought and research into ���On the Origin of Species.�۝" �۝  and Mr. Bettany�۪s Darwin as imagined by the director Jon Amiel and the screenwriter John Collee has more than an inkling of what the fallout will be. Religious authority will be challenged ��� some of Darwin�۪s allies notably Thomas Huxley froggily impersonated by Toby Jones fancy that it will disappear altogether ��� and age-old assumptions about nature human and otherwise will be shattered. A great civilizational drama looms but what we see on screen is a lumbering flat-footed fancy-dress melodrama." �۝ Darwin wrote somewhat defensively in reference to his theory of evolution by natural selection. There is certainly no shortage of grandiosity which is not quite the same thing in this film�۪s view of Darwin�۪s life." grinding labor and while that might be the case the filmmakers choose to convey the process of composition in the manner of a Gothic horror movie. Darwin writes with shaking hand and sweaty brow as storms rattle his windows and his specimen jars glow with sinister import." and is also visited by the ghost of his beloved daughter Annie (Martha West) whose death at the age of 10  is the domestic tragedy around which the movie is constructed. The hallucinations of a haggard more fully bald middle-aged Darwin give way to memories of his younger pinker hairier self as he enchants Annie with tales of zoological wonder and enlists her as his sounding board and intellectual ally." Emma played by Jennifer Connelly (who is married to Mr. Bettany in real life too) is tolerant of her husband�۪s scientific zeal but worried about the state of his soul. She grasps the social and theological implications of his theories perhaps more fully than he does and they exchange some lofty heated words about God. A local clergyman (Jeremy Northam) comes around to serve as a foil for his neighbor and to incarnate both the benevolence and the obtuseness of religious custom." �۝ while sympathetic to Darwin is hardly a partisan culture-war document. It notes the erosion of its hero�۪s faith but hardly consigns faith to the dust  bin of history. It aims for a liberal-minded balance at least on the thematic level. But at the same time the film traffics in the pseudo-psychological mumbo-jumbo that is the standard folk religion of the film biography and undermines its interest in reason by dabbling in emotive pop occultism. Recoiling from the possibility that ideas themselves might impart tension and interest to this tale Mr. Amiel and Mr. Collee induce a kind of literary brain fever and reduce Darwin�۪s work to a symptom of his mental and emotional anguish." so witty an embodiment of 19th-century scientific ambition in ���Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World�۝ (also written by Mr. Collee) is far less persuasive here. His performance is overwrought even in its rare moments of repose and in his spasms of grief or inspiration he behaves like someone�۪s idea of a Romantic poet at war with the world and in the grip of his muse." having played the imaginary friend of a great (and real) scientist in ���A Beautiful Mind �۝ is now portraying a scientist with an imaginary friend of his own. This is only partly a coincidence: the prevalence of such devices suggests that commercial filmmakers don�۪t believe their audiences can comprehend science without the help of magical thinking." �۝ which was based on a book by Randal Keynes who is Darwin�۪s great-great-grandson may well be a truthful portrait but it is not a convincing or illuminating one. Its view of life is that a paradigm-shifting breakthrough rather than being the product of either solitary genius or cultural ferment amounts instead to a pretext and a substitute for therapy." and the death of a child." based on a screen story by Mr. Amiel and Mr. Collee based on the book ���Annie�۪s Box�۝ by Randal Keynes; director of photography Jess Hall; edited by Melanie Oliver; music by Christopher Young; production designer Laurence Dorman; produced by Jeremy Thomas; released by Newmarket Films.

Visually it is an ode to St. Petersburg (its museums architecture and statuary are lovingly  photographed) and to the Neva River which runs by the city." ���A Room and a Half�۝ is sketchy. The film is more interested in the young Brodsky�۪s early interest in food and sex (stimulated by sculpture and the human form shown in art books) than in the specifics of his education and employment. There is an amusing scene of the adolescent Brodsky being rebuffed by a series of girls as he makes his first fumbling romantic overtures behind a curtain in his parents�۪ home." free thinking starts with Tarzan �۝ he says half-jokingly and we observe a Russian film audience riveted by a clip of Johnny Weissmuller." it seems hope and excitement pervaded the air at least for the student class."

deranged gonzo or just gone baby gone ��� no single adjective or even a pileup does justice to ���House �۝ a 1977 Japanese haunted-house freakout. Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi this energetic exemplar of pulp surrealism began surfacing in the United States last year playing at  events like the New York Asian Film Festival. Now in advance of the Criterion DVD which will be released later this year it is receiving its first must-see-now domestic theatrical run at the IFC Center in New York. A midnight movie in lysergic spirit and vibe this was a film made for late-night screening and screaming." though will be of surprise and delight not terror. ���House �۝ which turns on a misbegotten increasingly violent trip taken by seven teenage girls is not in the least scary despite its body count and gore. If the hairs on your neck snap to attention it will be only because of Mr. Obayashi�۪s flamboyant visual style his comic flights of fancy and genre manipulations. This might be about a haunted house but it�۪s the film that is more truly possessed: in one scene a piano bites off the fingers of a musician tickling its keys; in another a severed head tries to take a bite out of a girl�۪s rear snapping at the derri̬re as if it were an apple. Later a roomful of futons goes on the attack." but that�۪s getting um ahead of the story which opens with two uniformed teenage girls putting on a little photo shoot prettily posing and laughing. You quickly discover that one who�۪s known as Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami) a moniker used by both her friends and father (Saho Sasazawa) is  the center from which all the other chaotic parts flow and twist. Although she seems like a model daughter (her insistent smile could light up Tokyo or at least a toothpaste commercial) she churns with jealousy after her father introduces her to his new girlfriend Ryoko (Haruko Wanibuchi) another wide-smiling beauty whose lightly billowing hair and clothes suggest that she keeps company with an off-screen wind machine." Gorgeous decides to visit her dead mother�۪s sister (Yoko Minamida). The aunt agrees in a letter that arrives partly or so it seems with the help of a white cat that inexplicably materializes one day. Gorgeous enlists six of her friends as accompaniment a giggling retinue of nymphs fancifully named Sweet Melody Fantasy Prof Mac and Kung Fu. Traveling by train wheels and foot they arrive at an isolated house where the aunt who�۪s in a wheelchair  (if not for long!) lives with her white cat whose eyes beam out ominous green sparks and who has been immortalized in artwork throughout the house. Things soon start to go very badly for the teenagers." to gauge the significance of the gaudy colors the old-fashioned techniques (he periodically irises up and down) the superimpositions and flurries of jump cuts. The exterior backdrops tend to be overtly artificial the skies so streaked with orange that you half expect to see Scarlett O�۪Hara shaking her fist at the heavens. A scene with Gorgeous her father and his new squeeze meanwhile is shot through a multipaned window that separates the camera (and us) from the characters one of several such distancing strategies. There are close-ups but many are so glossy and stylized that they look like advertisements." the gauzy shot of a dreamy-looking girl playing the piano implies that she too sees herself in flattering soft focus. Then again these visual fillips also bring to mind a story that the actor Bill Duke once told about working with the director Samuel Fuller. Mr. Duke asked Fuller  why the camera was pointing up from beneath a glass table. Whose point of view is that? Mr. Duke wondered. It�۪s my point of view Fuller responded asserting his directorial prerogative." and at times it feels as if he threw everything ��� every movie he had ever seen every idea he had ever entertained ��� at the screen using the horror genre as a big box into which he could combine the bits and pieces he wanted to sample from avant-garde cinema Looney Tunes cartoons schlock Italian horror and martial arts movies. One of the most arresting sequences featuring pinwheeling female body parts brings to mind various Surrealist collages and that movement�۪s representations of dismembered female forms. (One of Mr. Obayashi�۪s many features is ���Sada �۝ a 1998 version of the same obsessive love story in Nagisa Oshima�۪s 1976 ���In the Realm of the Senses �۝ about a woman who severs her lover�۪s penis.)" though there�۪s a useful overview of his life and work by Paul Roquet at midnighteye.com.

While many victims in the movie will look familiar ��� whether waving from their New Orleans rooftops after the levees broke in 2005 or talking about their ruined lives and homes afterward ��� the majority of the victims here have usually been seen only in the background forlornly howling and wagging their tails." making a fine feature debut ���Mine�۝ tells the story of the pets mostly dogs and cats left behind during the storm when their humans were forced to flee. Like much of the rest of the world Ms. Pezanoski followed the news in horror as a natural disaster morphed into a larger catastrophe. What caught her eye however and clearly also her emotions were the impromptu animal-rescue teams that sprang into action and from across America descended on New Orleans. She flew to the inundated city and with a small team spent six weeks following rescuers as they broke into homes clambering through windows and crawl spaces to save masses of frightened starving animals." Ms. Pezanoski didn�۪t stop shooting once the waters retreated and the excitement and political controversy died down. Realizing that the rescued animals were now separated from companions who were scattered around the country and importantly were at first forbidden to return to New Orleans (and their pets) she kept her attention fixed and her digital video camera running. Those who tracked this story know what happened next which doesn�۪t lessen its impact. By the time some New Orleans pet owners returned to the city their animals had been shipped out of state where they were sometimes placed in foster homes and even adopted. New Orleans residents like Malvin Cavalier a dapper octogenarian who made a jaunty pair with his fluffy white dog Bandit were robbed of their homes and closest friends." at 81 minutes far too short for the scope of its ambitions ��� but it�۪s smart sincere and affecting. The emotional impact deepens as Ms. Pezanoski begins to narrow her focus interviewing residents like Mr. Cavalier along with Jessie Pullins and Gloria Richardson two other pet owners who were separated from their animals. Mr. Pullins named his cute mutt J. J. as in Jessie Jr. and hangs onto memories of his dog as if the animal were hope itself. Ms. Richardson is an elderly woman who was forcibly removed from her home even after she insisted on not being separated from her Labrador Murphy Brown. (All the separation stories are about dogs.)" race and class play significant roles in ���Mine �۝ which grows more disturbing as the weeks melt into years. The animal rescue world can be an eccentric battlefield a place where pets matter more than their people and Ms. Pezanoski registers its admirable and unsettling elements fairly. When a white lawyer chides a black woman for abandoning her dog ��� the woman says she had her hands full rescuing her children and wheelchair-bound mother ��� it�۪s hard not to flash back to those commentators who wondered why the poor inhabitants  of New Orleans didn�۪t just leave in their nonexistent cars. Ms. Pezanoski can only offer a gloss on this world of pain but she does so with compassion and admirable patience."

the title character played by Denzel Washington in ���The Book of Eli�۝ spends much of the story traveling by foot across an eerie landscape a long and quick knife at the ready. The brown dusty environs look familiar and not dotted with abandoned cars and the occasional corpse. When Eli pauses the camera settles near his feet and the sky opens above him like a sheltering hand. With his green jacket and unsmiling mouth he looks like a veteran of an unknown war a soldier of misfortune ���  though given the fog of religiosity that hangs over the movie he might   be an avenging angel." �۝ their torpid predictably hyperviolent 2001 take on Alan Moore  and Eddie Campbell�۪s graphic novel  about Jack the Ripper. Although this new one  has its comic-book qualities good and bad the Hugheses have stanched the blood in ���The Book of Eli �۝ making it easier to pay attention to what else is happening on screen. They stage an early fight for instance entirely in silhouette so that the arcs of spurting gore appear  black not red. Like all the fight sequences this one is highly stylized: set inside a tunnel with the camera low and the sky serving as an illuminated backdrop it looks  like a page out of a comic  come to animated life." but also because it�۪s a part of a meaningful piece  in a story  in which everything nature and civilization included has been stripped away. Much like the land and narrative  he travels through Eli has been similarly reduced. A loner he doesn�۪t speak much even to himself. During the first few minutes of the movie which opens in some barren woods with either falling snow or ash he remains silently fixed on his task: bagging a pitifully thin cat. His  first  companion is  a mouse (he offers it some roast cat) a creature that proves friendlier company than most of the isolated people he encounters the majority of whom as in ���The Road �۝  would like to cook him over a fire." with New Mexico standing in for America the Hugheses have created a plausible post-apocalyptic world one that draws from the western (Hollywood Sergio Leone) and the tradition of science-fiction dystopia. As George Miller proved in his brilliant ���Mad Max�۝ cycle ��� one of the Hughes brothers�۪ more overt cinematic touchstones here ��� and as Quentin Tarantino reaffirmed with his two ���Kill Bill�۝ films the western can be reconfigured to suit any number of contexts themes and warriors. (In one scene when Eli settles into a room a poster for the 1975 cult film ���A Boy and His Dog �۝ another post-apocalyptic fairy tale hangs on the wall behind him.)" a little human mayhem and a lot of atmospheric preambles Eli wanders into a deadwood town and the story kicks into gear for better if sometimes for disappointing worse. The happiest development is the introduction of Gary Oldman as Carnegie the leader of the outpost. Fortified by his thugs including some bulging muscle called Redridge (Ray Stevenson from the HBO show ���Rome�۝) Carnegie keeps the peace doling out the scarce supplies to the ragtag inhabitants. Among the few faces that stand out from the squinting scurrying horde are a Mr. Fixit  (an amusing Tom Waits); Carnegie�۪s lover Claudia (a sympathetic Jennifer Beals); and her daughter Solara (the miscast Mila Kunis) who despite the deprivations appears to have swung by a  Beverly Hills salon for an eyebrow wax." which at its most serious veers into lugubriousness a nice jolt and a flinty presence that Mr. Washington can spark against. But the story  that the two play out beat by beat clich̩ by clich̩ rarely rises to their talents. Written by Gary Whitta with some rewriting by  Anthony Peckham the story  takes a wrong turn once Solara enters the picture first as bait for Eli (he doesn�۪t bite) and then as his unwanted traveling companion. Ms. Kunis can work on the big screen as she proved in ���Forgetting Sarah Marshall.�۝ But dressed up in clothes that look as if they had been distressed for sale in a TriBeCa boutique her white white teeth shining and glossy hair swinging she is flatly absurd." with knowing wit in ���Who Framed Roger Rabbit�۝:  ���I�۪m not bad. I�۪m just drawn that way.�۝ Even so despite Solara and her manicured brows and the increasingly pro forma action ��� Eli has what Carnegie wants and so the bad man gives rabid chase ���  the movie keeps you watching and generally engaged. There�۪s a ticklish interlude at a house where Eli and Solara encounter a fine pair named Martha and George played with energy and inviting humor by  Frances de la Tour and the invaluable  Michael Gambon. Despite the air of unease and wary glances when George cranks up a phonograph and the disco song ���Ring My Bell�۝ pours out you�۪re happily goofily hooked."

occasionally impenetrable cinematic poem in Amos Gitai�۪s film ���Carmel �۝ whose title refers to the mountains near Haifa Mr. Gitai�۪s native city. The film begins with a prologue in which Mr. Gitai pictured in stills is shown strolling alone on a beach to the strains of a Mahler symphony. Then it abruptly plunges back in time to a crude re-enactment of the Roman siege  of Jerusalem in the first century A.D. when the future emperor Titus and his army destroyed the city and its temple." read in the background by an announcer create an echo-chamber effect that suggests the similarity between then and now. Nearly two millenniums later the weapons of war may be different but to Mr. Gitai�۪s immense sorrow and frustration the same kind of savagery persists." who at 59 is two years younger than the nation of Israel is inextricably entwined with the history of his war-torn country. But to those unfamiliar with his work and status as one of the leading Israeli filmmakers the movie is tough going. There is no background or explanation for many of the scenes while members of Mr. Gitai�۪s family appear  at times as themselves and at others are portrayed by actors.  The movie unfolds as an internal stream of consciousness that doesn�۪t bother to make smooth narrative connections." Mr. Gitai served in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  In the film he  visits the pasture in the Golan Heights where his helicopter was shot down by a Syrian missile and recounts his memories of the crash in detail. Mr. Gitai whose politics are left of center has had quarrels with the Israeli powers-that-be since partial censorship by the Israeli military of ���Field Diary �۝ his critical 1983 documentary about the Lebanon War drove him to settle in France for a decade." it is a passionate expression of Mr. Gitai�۪s anguish at living in a country in a continual state of war. A scene of him conversing with a man in a garage as the two talk past each other without listening suggests a political climate in which people with strongly held opposing convictions have become deaf to one other." �۝ which has the first of six screenings on Wednesday  at the Museum of Modern Art is also an impressionistic family chronicle with a tender heart.

���My Neighbor My Killer�۝ examines the emotional and judicial convulsions of post-genocide Rwanda through the oral testimonies of a handful of traumatized survivors." this restrained and ethically nuanced documentary investigates the effectiveness of the open-air tribunals known as gacacas.  Instituted nationally in 2005  by the Rwandan government these citizen courts try Hutu accused of the 1994 slaughter of  800 000  Tutsi and moderate Hutu.  In most cases the guilty are returned to the communities they helped decimate." it�۪s true: our killers have returned. What can we do?�۝ remarks one resigned widow whose recollections of macheted infants and bludgeoned family members are searingly similar to those of her peers. In no mood for the group hug of reconciliation these women disdain categorization as symbols of suffering: tough wise and sorrow-forged they address the camera with a forthrightness as admirable as the director�۪s willingness to absorb their occasional contempt. For Ms. Aghion the discomfort and impact of her intrusions are also part of the story." the tribunals   are volleys of accusation denial and unconvincing remorse.

�۝ Michael Cera plays a teenager with rampaging hormones and when the film opens at least no obvious romantic prospects. On the face of it this seems preposterous: Mr. Cera who turns 22 in June is a professional cutie-pie and very appealing to both the on screen characters (he usually gets the girl) and to gauge from his popularity the audience. After the movie I ran into a friend who was initially worried about this film because Mr.  Cera always does the same thing only to realize that what he does is exceptionally winning. Exactly." �۝ which was directed by Miguel Arteta and skillfully extracted   by Gustin Nash from the novel by C. D. Payne centers on a familiar type: the frustrated virgin. (Is there any other kind beyond the convent?)  The agonies of virginity have inspired myriad novels and films if not always with as much humor as in Mr. Payne�۪s telling. Another novelist Glen David Gold has called ���Youth in Revolt: The Journals of Nick Twisp�۝ the ���funniest book ever written �۝ suggesting a connection to  Richardson�۪s ���Clarissa.�۝ Mr. Payne might also have skimmed Lord Byron�۪s long poem about Don Juan: that famed lothario is mentioned twice in the novel and some of his adventures at times in drag are also echoed." a boy who lusts without letup and who when the film opens is despairing about his sex life. He�۪s 16 (in the novel he�۪s about to turn 14) an age that helps make Mr. Cera�۪s casting seem a touch less absurd and the character�۪s obsession with sex more comfortable. It�۪s a bit of a squirm when a near-child natters on about all things penile. But when the horndog in question is two years shy of the age of majority he is in the safer  zone of mid-adolescence where characters from the likes of ���Superbad�۝ (in which Mr. Cera played another anguished virgin) roam about making goo-goo eyes at the opposite sex and the occasional pie with tumescent desperation." embellished by Nick�۪s voice-over gets going  after he his mother Estelle (Jean Smart) and her fuzzy sex toy Jerry (Zach Galifianakis) head off for a short break.  Jerry has a friend with a cabin except that the retreat is actually a dilapidated motor home in the Restless Axles trailer park. There Nick meets Sheeni (Portia Doubleday) a sleepy-eyed Francophile who digs Jean-Paul Belmondo and is dating the largely unseen Trent (Jonathan Bradford Wright). Nick swoons for her after they engage in some cultural one-upmanship (throwing around names like Sinatra and Yasujiro Ozu) and proceeds to pursue her so relentlessly that if he weren�۪t played by Mr. Cera you might call him a stalker." he is  a stalker though Mr. Cera is so puppyish that he seems hardly  capable of doing anything  worrisome. That�۪s true even after he  develops an alter ego Fran̤ois (also played by Mr. Cera) a French-accented sophisticate with a wispy mustache who proceeds to boss Nick around giving him instructions on life and of course l�۪amour. With his white loafers cropped white pants and immaculate shirt Fran̤ois looks like he should be hustling dowagers on the C̫te d�۪Azur. It�۪s a weird conceit ��� for one thing it�۪s easy to believe that Nick might be going insane ��� but Fran̤ois is so silly having been conjured up by a teenager who is nowhere near as worldly as he thinks that it  mostly works." whose previous movies include ���Chuck & Buck�۝ and ���The Good Girl �۝ has the kind of quiet talent that can be easy to overlook. He�۪s particularly good with actors partly because he doesn�۪t crowd or push them. His scenes never feel forced or rushed even when they skew toward the madcap. (In a bid to win Sheeni Nick decides to become a delinquent which is why he conjures up Fran̤ois.) Mr. Arteta is equally good with the supporting cast which is packed with recognizable faces that might be distracting elsewhere but instead add different colors including Ms. Smart (warm sad foolish) and Ray Liotta (sleazy funny scary) as a cop who comforts Estelle one day and stays the night." but that matters little next to Ms. Smart�۪s comic timing Mr. Liotta�۪s salacious smile and the other grace notes delivered by Fred Willard Justin Long and Steve Buscemi all of whom enter briefly. What counts here is the telling and not the tale how the camera races after Nick when he runs down a street then moves in front of him as if to encourage his flight. What counts is how Mr. Cera�۪s face much like that of a silent-screen actor conveys sincerity and a sense of wonder in part because like those performers he doesn�۪t seem corrupted by the camera�۪s attention. For all we know he might like to swill Cristal with Paris Hilton but on screen he is an innocent." the combination of sex and teenagers involves certain activities and inspires certain word choices."

There is already so much doomsaying and apocalypse mongering going around. Why add to it?" yes but since it was at the time the only movie I�۪d seen in 2010 that isn�۪t really the point. And in truth there have been worse in recent months: ���Did You Hear About the Morgans? �۝ for example as potent an inducement to general cultural despair as anyone could ever want.

The cad! Also his name is Jeremy and the laws of Hollywood dictate that no romantic comedy heroine will ever wed a high-achieving Jeremy when let�۪s say a scruffy Declan is available." on the 29th of February a woman may propose marriage to a man ��� imagine! ��� Anna follows Jeremy to that country where he has conveniently gone for a medical conference. Blown off course by weather and transit problems she lands in the company of the aforesaid Declan hirsutely and monosyllabically played by the handsome Mr. Goode who seems eager to show off his gruff manliness but unsure of just how to go about it." that offered by the filmmakers ��� is to insult ignore and mock his co-star until a decent interval passes and he can fall in love with her.

We know that she is an obsessive planner who leaves nothing to chance but then again she seems to have crossed the ocean with a pair of expensive and impractical high-heeled shoes as her only footwear.

And though he is preoccupied with physical processes he is also aware of just how mysterious and complicated their implications and results can be." a German filmmaker who occasionally appears on screen with Dr. Kandel and his family gives only a sketch of his ideas and discoveries but the basic information about axons synapses and neurons is presented clearly and with enthusiasm. ���In Search of Memory�۝ is finally more concerned with the scientist than with his science and in his particular memories rather than his insights into memory as such. This is hardly a criticism since Dr. Kandel is an unusually engaging person with a pretty amazing biography." where he was born and to Brooklyn where he lived after fleeing the Nazis in the late 1930s. His accent and temperament are an almost perfect amalgam of the two places: a refined intellectual disposition forged in Sigmund Freud�۪s hometown and inflected by the scrapes and strivings of life in the borough of immigrants. He speaks German precisely if at times a bit haltingly and peppers his English with Yiddish words. He laughs easily and though  a prodigious talker ��� we see him lecturing  and also holding forth in the laboratory and at a family Seder ��� he seems like a good listener as well." ���In Search of Memory�۝ is more concerned with exploration than with comprehensiveness or conclusions.

�۝ the first essential movie of this young year is ���the last ride of the American cowboy.�۝ I suppose the word shepherd with its pastoral evocations of maidens in pantaloons and lads with flutes doesn�۪t have the necessary grit or mythic punch. But the quiet and cantankerous men in this movie mostly in cowboy hats ��� one of which is charmingly ornamented with a sheep pin on the crown ��� are keeping and sometimes losing sheep as surely as Little Bo Peep did." the movie largely involves the enormous effort along with the unintentional humor and grim realities involved in driving some 3 000 sensationally noisy sheep (how do they sleep?) up a mountain for summer pasture. Although the filmmakers shot for a number of years (taking eight in total to finish it) most of the material in the final movie was shot in 2001 when a Montanan rancher named Lawrence Allested became the last person to take his sheep into the Absaroka-Beartooth mountains on a federal grazing permit. Primarily  in south-central Montana just north of Yellowstone with a bit spilling into Wyoming this wilderness area encompasses nearly a million acres and to judge from the movie looks like paradise." depending on the roaring wind the grazing sheep the herding dogs and the two singing cursing hired hands ��� John Ahern and Pat Connolly ��� who watch over this often-less-than-peaceable kingdom for a long stretch. Shot in classic observational documentary style without any on-  or off-camera narration to guide you ���Sweetgrass�۝ opens as winter is giving way to spring and the sheep are still at the ranch being shorn for their wool and giving birth to the year�۪s  lambs.  It can be brutal if also caring work. In one scene a man roughly throws newborn lambs around trying to gauge which orphan a ewe will accept; in another a different man puts a fresh  lambskin on an orphan trying to fool the dead lamb�۪s mother into adopting the new animal." who from all the tail-level visuals seems to have spent a lot of time crouching or on his knees ���Sweetgrass�۝ is often astonishingly beautiful even if the image quality of the video sometimes disappoints. Mr. Castaing-Taylor has an extraordinary eye: he takes you right into the center of the herd so it almost feels as if you�۪re jostling alongside the animals as they rush for food or surge up a ravine. As can be the case with some observational movies the absence of narration proves very freeing: without a voice chattering in your ear you can immerse yourself in the movie on your own terms as you watch and really listen to the people the animals the whole blooming buzzing confusion." which turn out to be fascinating almost hypnotic subjects for the camera whether they�۪re comically bleating at one another like rush-hour subway riders or swarming across the range like a single organism. The filmmakers make brilliant use of extreme long shots throughout inserting breathtaking panoramas into the mix that convey the surrounding grandeur even as the images also suggest that however much man tries to dominate nature nature prevails. Perhaps though it helps when the Bureau of Land Management gets involved to protect some of the area�۪s inhabitants like the bears that the two herders shoot at (and miss) one evening. You can mourn the passing of this kind of shepherding I suppose or be thankful that the native bighorn sheep again have the mountains to themselves." ���Sweetgrass�۝ doesn�۪t have directing or (image) editing credits:  Mr. Castaing-Taylor is its recordist Ms. Barbash its producer. Both have day jobs at Harvard University where he is the director of the Sensory Ethnography Laboratory and also teaches and she is an associate curator of visual anthropology at the Peabody Museum; they also have several books including one on the ethnographic filmmaker Robert Gardner (who was at Harvard for decades). Elsewhere Mr. Gardner once listed ���Modern Times �۝ ���The Rules of the Game�۝ and ���Zero for Conduct�۝ as among his favorite ethnographic films because ���the sheer observational power that illuminates these films contributes more to an understanding of the human condition than the great majority of all other motion picture documents with the emphatic inclusion of nearly all those that are referred to as ���ethnographic.�۪�ʉ۝" by extension documentary among them questions of beauty pedagogy objectivity and of course truth. Unlike most fiction cinema nonfiction film is burdened by its relationship to the real to the widely accepted often underexamined idea that it is closer to the truth of existence human relations and the world than say a Hollywood movie. (I think I hear Michael Moore laughing.) Yet as the documentary filmmaker Emile de Antonio (���Point of Order�۝) said ���With any cut at all objectivity fades away.�۝ In ���Sweetgrass �۝ a graceful and often moving meditation on a disappearing way of life there is little here that is objective and much that is magnificent." 209 West Houston Street West Village.

�۝ the bottled-up anguish of the Richters a well-to-do family in Munich whose 19-year-old son and golden boy Alexander (Cyril Sjostrom) shot himself to death is conjured by a turbulent Peter Gabriel song ���Signal to Noise �۝ heard on the soundtrack." �۝ cries Mr. Gabriel as intensifying sound effects evoke the inchoate multiple forces that might have driven Alexander to suicide." the movie flashes back and forth between Alexander�۪s tightly wound mother Eliane (Corinna Harfouch) stumbling tearfully through the woods in which he shot himself and his 22-year-old sister Lilli (Karoline Herfurth) a dancer wildly thrashing about in an empty studio." Eliane recalls Beth Jarrett the controlling mother of ���Ordinary People �۝ played so fiercely on the screen by Mary Tyler Moore 30 years ago. Like ���Ordinary People �۝ ���A Year Ago in Winter �۝ adapted by Ms. Link from ���Aftermath �۝ a novel by the American author Scott Campbell is a study of the fallout from unconscious hubris within a family for which failure is not an option." ���A Year Ago in Winter �۝ which has six screenings at the Museum of Modern Art through Monday doesn�۪t succumb to the usual weepie-of-the-week clich̩s. There are no last-minute revelations that clear up every mystery; nor is there anything resembling a reconciliatory group hug." whose film ���Nowhere in Africa�۝ won a 2002  Oscar for best foreign-language film as a precisely calibrated and persuasively acted mood piece that doesn�۪t throw you a reassuring lollipop. The catalyst for the family�۪s healing is a painter Max Hollander (Josef Bierbichler) whom Eliane commissions to create a large portrait of Lilli and Alexander (the son�۪s image posthumously gleaned from photographs and videos) seated together at a piano." the film�۪s main character elicit  deepening insights into the Richters�۪ psychological modus operandi. As Lilli who is initially hostile to the project Ms. Herfurth not only physically resembles Lauren Ambrose but also has the same contradictory mixture of bravado and insecurity as Ms. Ambrose�۪s character Claire Fisher in ���Six Feet Under.�۝ And as you watch her unconsciously act out her dual sense of entitlement and self-loathing in a self-abasing relationship with a sadistic sculptor she embodies all the contradictions of a family that values achievement over intimacy." far from being the movie�۪s kindly surrogate therapist has his own demons. Divorced and reclusive with an 18-year-old son he is tormented by a sexual ambivalence he has barely begun to explore. The most original aspect of ���A Year Ago in Winter�۝ is the healing role played by art and the artist." a psychological picture of the Richters begins to coalesce. The marriage of the father Thomas (Hanns Zischler) a renowned genetic scientist and Eliane a successful decorator is on emotional autopilot. While Eliane doted on Alexander Thomas pushed him to succeed." resentful of her brother�۪s favored place in the family hierarchy coolly rejected Alexander�۪s affectionate overtures. All this is suggested in an early version of the dual portrait that turns out to be not at all what Eliane wanted. The final version of the painting tells the truth." based on the novel ���Aftermath�۝ by Scott Campbell; director of photography Bella Halben; edited by Patricia Rommel; music by Niki Reiser; production designer Susann Bieling; produced by Uschi Reich and Martin Moszkowicz; released by IFC Films.

�۝ a second documentary about a poor community of trash recyclers on the outskirts of Cairo. But in the hands of the director and photographer Mai Iskander this new film digs deeper into the politics of a life that few would choose but many depend on." Cairo�۪s 18 million residents have for decades relied on zabbaleen (Arabic for ���garbage people�۝) to collect their waste which the zabbaleen do with enviable thoroughness  �� and an 80 percent recycling rate. Filming over four years Ms. Iskander highlights three charismatic youths as they face competition from foreign companies with more mechanized if significantly less green methods." family tensions and political action (the zabbaleen don�۪t whine; they strive to modernize) ���Garbage Dreams�۝ records the tremblings of a culture at a crossroads. At no point is this more evident than when two of the young men sponsored by a Welsh recycling group travel to a sleek recycling plant in Wales. One moment they�۪re on a mound of rubbish in Cairo picking through plastic and shards of glass the next they�۪re surrounded by Welsh pastures and humming conveyor belts." 18 is unimpressed. ���Here there�۪s technology but no precision �۝ he snorts appalled at the plant�۪s recycling rate of around 20 percent.

at times horrifying series of events that have filled up the previous 2 hours 25 minutes but rather because it seems to unfold as if none of them have taken place. Taken alone the film�۪s final image might conjure a mood of gentle pastoral nostalgia. Here in glowing understated black and white we glimpse part of a world that used to be. The camera sits inside an austerely beautiful village church that is illuminated by winter morning sunlight its pews filling with congregants whose dark clothes and weathered faces bespeak hardy old virtues of work faith and family." �۝ a chronicle of small-town German life on the eve of World War I is that the social order it depicts has vanished from the earth. Good riddance to the good old days! But at the same time Mr. Haneke may intend that sense of distance of pastness to be illusory so that the strangeness of these people and their doings is shadowed by an uncomfortable sense of recognition. We fool ourselves if we think bygones are bygones. We�۪re on a guilt trip down memory lane. And though the road twists and turns and reveals some pretty scenery in the end we arrive in a familiar place to be lectured and scolded by a filmmaker whose rich craft disguises the poverty of his ideas." played on screen in his relative youth (by Christian Friedel) as an earnest chubby-faced bumbler and in voice-over narration (by Ernst Jacobi) as a ruminative old man. This teacher who like most of the adult characters in the film is not referred to by name is by far the most benign ��� if also the most ineffectual ��� authority figure in a place that turns out to be a veritable theme park of patriarchal abuses." with its tidy brick houses and wind-swept wheat fields where residents tip their hats and address one another with unfailing formality masks a carnival of cruelty. Children are beaten and molested. Women are silenced and humiliated. Workplace accidents claim the lives of innocent farmwives. Horses and house pets are maimed cabbages are wantonly decapitated and the only force more fearsome than the brutality of fathers is the innocence of children." born  in 1942 and perhaps the most lauded living European filmmaker with a surname other than Dardenne traffics in shock and terror but in a cerebral systematic way. His films rarely foreshadow their jolts or speed up their plots to generate suspense but rather proceed with almost meditative calm to weave a cocoon of dread around intimations of mystery and implications of violence." �۝ which won the Palme d�۪Or in Cannes and the top European Film Award this year is a rare foray out of the clamor and anomie of modern urban Europe that is Mr. Haneke�۪s favored setting. The film also marks his return to his native German after a decade of mainly French-language films. In it he uses the sharp elegance of Christian Berger�۪s monochrome cinematography (achieved by shooting in color then draining it away) the grammatical precision of old-fashioned speech and the pageantry of period drama to lull and also to inflame the audience�۪s expectations. The effect is something like a ghost story the horror of which is at once elusive and pervasive. What is happening here? Why is it happening?" apparently for just that sinister purpose. That apparently inexplicable crime is followed by others including the abduction and beating of one small child and the near blinding of another. There are whispers and denunciations and visits from the police but no solutions are forthcoming." as suspicions multiply we are led on a tour of several households which taken together offer a sociological composite portrait of guilt and repression. The schoolteacher whose courtship of a milky-fresh young woman named Eva (Leonie Benesch) provides hints of tender comedy traffics mainly in rumors and surmises while the camera assumes a position of omniscience. (Unless that is it is the vehicle for the narrator�۪s retroactive speculation or self-protecting deceit which is not unthinkable.)" the town�۪s principal employer and landowner; the doctor a widower with two children and an interesting relationship with the midwife (Susanne Lothar); the steward (Josef Bierbichler); a tenant farmer (Branko Samarovski); and perhaps most important the  pastor (Burghart Klaussner)." with the partial exception of the poor farmer represents a different face of power. And each one accordingly manifests his own special brand of awfulness mistreating those close to him with methods appropriate to his station. The Baron is cold and sarcastic with his wife (Ursina Lardi). The steward beats his children in a state of volcanic rage while the pastor  does the same in a mood of pious sorrow." their children may be worse. A gaggle of towheaded darlings walks through the film their mild smiles so sinister that they might have wandered in from the 1960 British science-fiction horror chestnut ���Village of the Damned.�۝ Anyone who has seen Mr. Haneke�۪s ���Cache�۝ or his twin versions of ���Funny Games�۝ will be aware that he does not believe in the blamelessness of youth. Quite the contrary: children in his world carry the sins of their parents in concentrated highly toxic form and are also capable of a pure motiveless experimental evil." who are either demons or victims driven to mischief by severe paternal discipline or so intrinsically bad that no punishment could suffice? Do the math: it�۪s 1914. In 20 or 30 years what do you suppose these children will be up to? Our narrator well into old age tells us that he is revisiting the strange events in the village to ���clarify things that happened in our country�۝ afterward." mystifying the historical phenomenon it purports to investigate. Forget about Weimar inflation and the Treaty of Versailles and whatever else you may have learned in school: Nazism was caused by child abuse. Or maybe by the intrinsic sinfulness of human beings. ���The White Ribbon�۝ is a whodunit that offers a philosophically and aesthetically unsatisfying answer: everyone. Which is also to say: no one." his chosen emblem of blindness and hypocrisy. After caning his children for a minor infraction the pastor makes his oldest son (Leonard Proxauf) and daughter (Maria-Victoria Dragus) wear white ribbons which serve both as emblems of shame and reminders of the purity of soul they are in danger of sacrificing. ���The White Ribbon�۝ is offered to its grateful masochistic audience in a similarly punitive and yet oddly forgiving spirit as a reminder of just how awful we are and how much worse we used to be." violence repression."

but most  are bred in digital laboratories and given voice and charisma by movie stars. The inscrutable dignity of actual beasts is less often captured and may even seem strange when encountered in a documentary like ���Old Partner �۝ the first feature directed by Lee Chung-ryoul." slow-moving nameless ox the hero of the film would be a slight distortion since the only actions he performs are the ones that have defined his daily existence for more than 30 years. He ruminates. He pulls a plow and occasionally a cart moving with exquisite slowness as the world goes rushing by. His body is bony and massive and his face is a perpetual enigma expressing steadfastness resignation or more likely a state of bovine consciousness beyond the ken of humans." thought to be the oldest in South Korea is a stranger to people. On the contrary he is the longtime companion of an elderly farming couple Choi Won-kyun and Lee Sam-soon. Older than most of their nine children the ox has shared their daily round of work and rest a utilitarian arrangement that turns out to be surprisingly complicated. In his quiet unassuming way the animal sits at the apex of a love triangle serving Mr. Choi as a helpmate  and confidant and representing to Ms. Lee a rival for her husband�۪s devotion." frail and partially deaf one of his legs withered by a long-ago accident is cantankerous and impatient with his wife and tenderly solicitous of his beast of burden. He prepares special fodder and keeps his fields pesticide-free. When late in the film he reluctantly agrees to sell the ox at an agricultural fair he is shocked at  the low  offers. It is  also possible that he has set his asking price high enough to make a sale unlikely." meanwhile who has no grudge against the ox (though she seems to prefer a younger heifer) peppers her husband with complaints that sound both sincere and habitual. She works hard she�۪s tired and she has wasted her life on the wrong man. Mr. Choi tunes her out but  he is quick to respond whenever the ox seems to need something." the condition these three  share can  be described only as happiness though it is not the kind of material comfort often associated with that word. Rather like the French farmers in Raymond Depardon�۪s documentaries on rural life or the shepherds in the recent Kazakh film ���Tulpan �۝ they represent an old and difficult way of life that seems to be fading  before our eyes. The  elderly couple�۪s relationship with the animal who has shared their lives may seem odd charming and a bit absurd but the deep and poignant insight of Mr. Lee�۪s film is that such complicated interspecies bonds are perfectly natural." directed and edited by LeeChung-ryoul; director of photography JiJae-woo; music by Heo Hoon and Min Soyun;produced by Goh Young-jae; releasedby Shcalo Media Group.

�۝ Bryce Dallas Howard ignites like a firecracker playing an impulsive emotionally unstable heiress recklessly defying the hidebound conventions of 1920s Memphis high society. This Southern period piece the first feature directed by Jodie Markell exhumes an obscure Tennessee Williams screenplay written in 1957 in which Williams returned to realism following the crushing reception of his symbol-weighted stage drama ���Orpheus Descending.�۝" Fisher Willow has the familiar hallmarks of a wounded Williams angel but lacks the tragic dimension of his greatest creation Blanche DuBois. Within the Williams canon the screenplay qualifies as middle-drawer. With its strained quasi-poetic language that fitfully tries to soar ���The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond�۝ is a significant though less than monumental feat of reclamation." Fisher is too rebellious a creature to nestle comfortably into any social niche. Having studied at the Sorbonne dabbled in painting and flitted through European bohemian salons she is a conspicuously cosmopolitan presence in a provincial Southern society that Williams views with a scathing contempt. Here the closest thing to art is a prim ���end of summer�۝ pageant performed by preadolescent girls and attended by Fisher�۪s stern maiden aunt Cornelia (a seriously miscast and wooden Ann-Margret)." the Willow family name has been tarnished by the drowning of several tenant farmers in a flood caused by Fisher�۪s father�۪s demolition of a levee. Fisher is squirming under the thumb of Cornelia who controls the purse strings and has warned her that if she doesn�۪t marry respectably and settle down the millions she stands to inherit will be left to the church." she hires as an escort  Jimmy Dobyne (Chris Evans) the impoverished son of the drunk (Will Patton) who runs the commissary on her father�۪s plantation. At their first fancy social outing for which she supplies Jimmy�۪s formal wear she blithely introduces him as the grandson of a former Tennessee governor." handsome but without a trace of vanity and unfailingly honest he cares for his drunken father and regularly visits his silent spectral mother in a mental hospital. It is no wonder that Fisher falls in love with this impossibly perfect abstraction and tries to change their relationship from a business arrangement into a romantic one. ���You could get used to me �۝ she pleads in vain." in the hostess�۪s driveway a $5 000 earring lent to her by Cornelia. The imperious and distracted Fisher is too self-involved to offer much support when Jimmy imagines she has accused him of theft. And when a treacherous former date of Jimmy�۪s pounces on him Fisher retreats into a sulk." Fisher visits a kindred free spirit Miss Addie (a wonderful Ellen Burstyn) now a miserably pain-wracked woman  immobilized by a stroke who entreats Fisher to give her ���deliverance�۝ through an overdose of pain medication. In her youth Addie had fled to China where she remained for years and became addicted to opium. In a phantasmagoric scene Fisher takes some of Addie�۪s opiates and experiences much of the rest of the party as an eerie waking dream." Fisher and Addie are the poignant manifestations of the restless dreamers and poets with whom he passionately identified: wayward moths fluttering unsteadily toward a light glimpsed through the windows of the prisons in which they find themselves alone and misunderstood."

But his desperate search for Young-min�۪s hideout is hindered by the unfortunate coincidence of a malodorous public attack on the mayor of Seoul: the ensuing P.R. debacle hobbles the police leaving Jung-ho and his dopey sidekick (Koo Bon-woong) on their own." the depiction of official malfeasance and indifference and the somber final twist mark ���The Chaser�۝ as unmistakably Korean. Like so many other serious movies made in South Korea it uses genre conventions to mask ��� barely ��� a story about a culture agonizingly divided over questions of violence state control and the possibility of individual freedom.

The audience follows his thought process through slow-motion pre-enactment observing how the laws of anatomy and physics will be used to snap bones gouge organs and turn flesh into pulp. Then having seen it diagramed once on screen we see it all again with more noise in real time. Elementary!" who arrived in Victorian pop culture in 1887 (with the publication of ���A Study in Scarlet�۝) has adapted since then to changes in taste and entertainment technology. He was a proto-superhero amenable to all kinds of elaboration and variation and even a measure of mockery as long as the basics of the brand were respected. For most of his existence he has lived at 221B Baker Street smoking a pipe playing the violin and sticking faithfully to bachelorhood and his belief in the functional elegance of the deerstalker hat." and the chief innovation of this new franchise-ready incarnation directed by Guy Ritchie and played by Robert Downey Jr. is that he is in addition to everything else a brawling head-butting fist-in-the-gut knee-in-the-groin action hero." for sure and as played by Mr. Downey with his characteristic twitchy wit and haggard insouciance he has more intelligence than the movie knows what to do with. (His Holmes has also lost the deerstalker favoring battered porkpie- or bowlerlike headwear perhaps in homage to Charlie Chaplin another character Mr. Downey has played.)" most successfully realized early in his directing career in ���Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels�۝ and ���Snatch �۝ has always been to be cool: to make cool movies about cool guys with cool stuff.

And so do the kinetic chases and scrapes that lead us through the city as Holmes and his pal Watson (Jude Law) scramble to unravel a conspiracy so diabolical that it fails to be  interesting. Best of all is the banter between Mr. Downey and Mr. Law who is looser and more mischievous than he�۪s allowed himself to be in quite some time. The mustache suits him." flouncy red dress to add a splash of color and dispel a few hints of homoerotic subtext. Holmes and Watson are longtime roommates with an Oscar-and-Felix routine of quarrelsome affection. Watson�۪s engagement to a page of half-written dialogue named Mary (Kelly Reilly) sends Holmes into a snit of jealousy which loses some of its interesting implications when Ms. McAdams shows up as a luscious thief named Irene Adler. I wonder: is she an ancestor of Jake and Jane Adler the main characters of ���It�۪s Complicated �۝ which also opens on Friday? Or does a movie opening on Christmas need to have a character named Adler in it for some reason?" in any case is a perfectly charming actress and performs gamely as the third wheel of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene though she figures in a few of Conan Doyle�۪s stories feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance. She offers a little something for the ladies ��� who according to airtight Hollywood corporate logic are more likely to see a movie like this one if there�۪s a feisty woman in it ��� and also something for the lads who much as they may dig fights and explosions and guns and chases also like girls." in spite of the barely sublimated physical passion they manifest for each other in nearly every scene. I�۪m sure Warner Brothers would like me to change the subject and tell you about the amazing diabolical conspiracy that tests Holmes�۪s ingenuity along with his faith in the supremacy of reason." executed for a series of murders returns from the dead to mobilize an ancient secret society that he may have time-traveled into a Dan Brown novel to learn about. Doesn�۪t that sound fascinating? I thought not.

complete with puffs of smoke glitter and grunge some hocus-pocus mumbo jumbo and even a dwarf. It�۪s the story of a holy man or maybe a fool who transports customers into fantastical worlds of their own imagining. In ���Critique of Pure Reason �۝ his exploration of understanding Kant used the phrase ���ens imaginarium�۝  to describe pure space and pure time preconditions of imagination.  Think of this movie as a gloss on the nature of imagination  (well kind of sort of) only with hurdy-gurdy music and alas Heath Ledger�۪s final screen performance." at 28 in January  2008 from an accidental overdose of prescription medicines. Mr. Gilliam in either a desperate or inventive move decided to complete the movie with three different marquee names ��� Johnny Depp Jude Law and a very good Colin Farrell ��� all of whom play aspects of the character originated by Mr. Ledger. It�۪s a weird not entirely successful experiment. Mr. Ledger�۪s death understandably haunts the movie shadowing its every gaudy and hyperventilated scene to alternatively distracting and depressing effect. It�۪s hard to think how it could have been otherwise even if the movie does have its attractions including some of its lead performances." Mr. Gilliam plunges you into the world of ���The Imaginarium�۝ so brusquely that it takes a little time  to get your bearings. The story opens in a dark corner of contemporary London in which a jerry-built theater stage lights brilliantly glowing has materialized amid the gritty urban landscape. The theater is the imaginarium of the film�۪s title a traveling show with a remarkable feature attraction Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer delightful) a boozy graybeard wearing robes and a smear of white makeup that makes him look like a carnival relic." in a manner of speaking though his roots prove to be more mystical than strictly performative: once upon a time he was sharing deep thoughts on a mountain  when the devil nicknamed Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) stopped by for a visit. One thing led to another and years (centuries? millenniums?) later Dr. Parnassus roams about peddling his fantasies or rather those of his customers in the company of his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole a heart-faced beauty) a 15-year-old on the verge of 16 who with her ripe shape and restless thoughts seems ready for harvest. Also along are Dr. Parnassus�۪s two helpers Percy (Verne Troyer) and Anton (Andrew Garfield) who pines after Valentina but faces competition when they rescue a man swinging from a rope Tony (Mr. Ledger)." if only because it serves as a blunt reminder of his death and even some of the early irrelevant chatter about a possible suicide. Mr. Gilliam could have omitted this interlude with some skillful cutting or at the very least trimmed it down to lessen its grimness and any taint of exploitation. He might have thought he was honoring the actor�۪s legacy by letting the scene play out complete with a vivid silhouetted image of the nearly expired character hanging by a rope but what he�۪s mainly done is punch a hole in his own fiction. Mr. Ledger�۪s performance ��� Tony is soon kicking and scheming ��� helps fill the hole though not entirely." Tony immediately joins ranks with the travelers eventually taking over ringmaster duties and bringing new energy customers and production values to the shabby show. By the time he�۪s hit his stride this natural smoothie is sweet-talking women into parting with their purses so they can take a ride into their own feverish imaginings. Much like musical numbers the fantasy sequences elbow into the narrative with bursts of candied color and the kind of whimsical touches that will be familiar to fans of Mr. Gilliam�۪s work his animations in particular. In one sequence a dowager floats gaga in a wonderland filled with high heels the size of houses a different Tony (Mr. Depp) at her side." a younger thinner version of herself stares back which helps explain why visitors to the imaginarium are so blissed out when they exit. Whether you will be similarly enthralled on leaving ���The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus�۝ largely depends on whether its will-o�۪-the-wisp story from a script by Mr. Gilliam and Charles McKeown means less to you than the movie�۪s  hallucinations its self-conscious play between the theatrical and the cinematic registers and its charming performances. It might also depend on whether you can see past the loss  of Mr. Ledger as Mr. Gilliam has tried and instead hold onto this last bittersweet performance. Despite the fatigue around his eyes he looks like he really enjoyed his trip into Doctor Gilliam�۪s imaginarium." Nicola Pecorini; edited by Mick Audsley; music by Mychael Danna and Jeff Danna; production designer Anastasia Masaro; produced by William Vince Amy Gilliam Samuel Hadida and Mr. Gilliam; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

daffy if at times daft ���It�۪s Complicated �۝ Meryl Streep plays Jane Adler a successful restaurateur who�۪s about to nest happily alone in an upscale Southern California coastal community or so it seems. Divorced with three adult children who enjoy her company (the middle one is just moving out) Jane lives in a large house on a lush sprawl surrounded by trees and no visible neighbors. It�۪s such a bucolic vision you half expect a few deer a couple of bunnies and the bluebird of happiness to swing by for a visit and a quick song. Instead you get Rita Wilson trilling support as one of Jane�۪s close friends." a Hollywood filmmaker who makes female-specific indulgences that at their irresistible best are testaments to the power of fairy tales. Like her finest film ���Something�۪s Gotta Give�۝ (2003) this new one revolves around a woman in late middle age who after years of going it alone in bed and out suddenly becomes sexually and romantically involved with two very different men. What kinks up ���It�۪s Complicated�۝ ever so slightly is that one of the two suitors here is Jane�۪s former husband Jake (Alec Baldwin) an unreconstructed womanizer now married to the much-younger Agness (Lake Bell) a hard-bellied beauty with abs and smiles of steel." which stands out next to the reassuringly ordinary Jane Jake and the fourth wheel Adam (Steve Martin) who also catches Jane�۪s eye. Agness enters belly first sashaying into the opening scene as the camera and Jane both fix on Agness�۪s stomach an image that underscores her fertility while also reducing her to a body part (and lopping off her head). ���Something�۪s Gotta Give�۝ opens on a similar thematic note with images of sylphlike young beauties striding across the screen their legs slicing the frame. We have met the enemy Ms. Meyers seems to be suggesting and she is firmer  ���  and younger." perhaps but never better at least in Meyersland. One of the most interesting things about Ms. Meyers�۪s romances is that they are pitched at a niche demographic by which I mean women over 40. Ms. Streep looks sensational but she and her crinkles also look close enough to her real age (60) to reassure you that she hasn�۪t resorted to the knife. That may sound grotesque and petty. But in an industry in which actresses whittle themselves down to nothing so they can have a little screen space only to fade away once they hit a certain age there�۪s nothing trivial about a movie that insists a middle-aged woman with actual breasts and hips and wrinkles can be beautiful and desirable while also fully desiring." Luke (Hunter Parrish). After a coincidental meeting at a bar the parents end up drinking and dancing the night away capping their giddy evening with an off-screen bout between the sheets. Afterward a grinning Jake enthuses over the encounter a recap that a stunned-looking Jane answers by vomiting. But if Jane has doubts which she shares through Ms. Meyers�۪s customary stream of babble the heart or maybe the head wants what it wants. Whatever the case Jane and Jake continue their affair back home sneaking around while their children as well as Agness and Adam remain oblivious." yet Ms. Meyers doesn�۪t have her own visual signature. What she does have is a kind of upmarket taste and the means to translate it onto the screen. Here as in the other films she has directed the camera is little more than a machine that takes nicely lighted pictures of the designer items the actors included which she has amassed and with the exacting attention of an interior decorator prettily arranged inside the frame." in that the films she has directed including ���What Women Want�۝ and ���The Holiday �۝ express a personal vision. Being an auteur isn�۪t simply a matter of what you do with the camera and why; among other things pacing also counts (and Ms. Meyers has very good comic timing when it comes to banter) as do the performances. The movie�۪s best moments may be to borrow a thought from Andrew Sarris appreciated as exquisite whimsy (he was talking about a 1935 romantic comedy) but even in such whimsy Mr. Sarris reminds us a  director�۪s touch can be ���immortalized as a figure of style.�۝" largely white worlds where the help is discreetly out of view. Both ���It�۪s Complicated�۝ and ���Something�۪s Gotta Give�۝ center on an independent woman whose life despite all its personal and professional markers immediately expands ��� even as it shrinks ��� once a man starts rocking her bed and head. Before her first adulterous night with Jake Jane is a melancholy solo act whether she�۪s weeping in her kitchen after her daughter moves out or trading somewhat desperately raunchy sex jokes with her girlfriends. Jake�۪s attentions give Jane snap vibrancy some color in her cheeks and most important a comic foil. Jake in other words turns her into a Nancy Meyers character." which suggests a belief in love enduring even after a marriage dies. That sounds wonderfully romantic or a prescription for pathology maybe both. Whatever the balance between madness and madcap classic screwball comedies involve a woman and a man meeting on the battlefield or in a newspaper office and sparring their way into coupledom. Ms. Meyers wants as her title implies to complicate that formula. But no matter how liberating some of her conceits notably the older heroine her embrace of sexist stereotypes including male characters as agents of narrative change keep her and her female characters down." �۝ Ms. Streep mugging wildly if winningly takes this character and makes you love her just as Mr. Baldwin does with Jake who with his shark smiles and thrusting gut beautifully conveys male vanity in its twilight. Jane may be too perfectly dressed coiffed and housed to be plausible. But Ms. Streep makes you believe in Jane or rather makes you want to believe in her from her casually chic wardrobe to the indulgent smiles she bestows on her children and lovers all of whom need nurturing. The truth is that everyone needs a little coddling which could be the key to Ms. Meyers�۪s peculiar talent: She pampers her audience shamelessly."

the new Romanian film ���Police Adjective�۝ is a story of law enforcement with a special interest in grammar. Its climactic scene is not a chase or a shootout but rather a tense suspenseful session of dictionary  reading." Corneliu Porumboiu whose previous feature was ���12:08 East of Bucharest �۝ has a talent for infusing mundane absurd moments with gravity and drama as well as humor. The dictionary in that scene is a versatile comic prop and also an instrument of instruction and humiliation. It is introduced by an officious police captain (Vlad Ivanov who played the predatory abortionist in Cristian Mungiu�۪s ���4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days�۝) who wants to teach his underling a lesson." after all with a bit of a twist in the tail ��� but would also blunt the bite of Mr. Porumboiu�۪s mordant satire. So let�۪s just note that the Romanian word for ���police�۝ is used as an adjective in two ways. The first usage applies to (I quote the English subtitles) ���a novel or film  involving criminal happenings that are in some degree mysterious resolved in the end through the ingenuity of a police officer or detective.�۝ In an unexpected and somewhat underhanded way that describes the action of ���Police Adjective.�۝ It is at least as relevant however that the other cited use of the adjective is to modify the word ���state.�۝" �۝ says the captain waving off not only his country�۪s specific history but also a possibly significant distinction between its old totalitarian regime and its new democratic order. Mr. Porumboiu whose hapless characters debate whether the revolution of 1989 really took place in their corner of the country is not making an argument that nothing has changed in Romania since the bad old days. Rather he is investigating the nature of bureaucratic authority and the perverse crushing effects it can have on an individual." a detective played with brusque weary likability by Dragos Bucur who in previous roles (notably in Radu Muntean�۪s ���Boogie�۝ and Cristi Puiu�۪s ���Stuff and Dough�۝) has embodied the malaise of early adulthood in post-Communist Romania. Cristi is working on a case that would by the standard of American television cop shows be less than trivial. He is gathering evidence against a high school student who smokes a little hashish and has been informed on by a friend and smoking buddy." who also hangs out with them. And as Cristi follows them stakes out their houses and files his reports he feels more and more uneasy. In other countries he explains to a prosecutor who is a little more sympathetic than the captain the casual possession and use of small quantities of hashish is not really a police matter at all." Adjective�۝ is the tension between Cristi�۪s professional duty and his conscience a conflict the dictionary is called on to adjudicate. And the substance of the movie is a series of slowly paced scenes that follow him through his routines. He deals with pushy or recalcitrant co-workers trudges through days of surveillance work without changing his sweater and returns home for desultory conversations with his wife Anca (Irina Saulescu) who matter-of-factly tells him that things are not working out between them and then continues as if nothing of consequence had been said." as Anca a teacher and something of a linguistic pedant listens to a romantic pop song over and over on her computer she and Cristi have a debate about images and symbols in literature. Why he wonders don�۪t people just stick with the literal meanings of words and forget about all the fancy stuff. His position is a hyperbolically blunt statement of an impulse that drives much recent Romanian cinema away from metaphor and toward a concrete illusion-free reckoning with things as they are." but that sturdy old word is not quite sufficient to describe ���Police Adjective �۝ which is at once utterly plain even affectless and marvelously rich. Mr. Porumboiu�۪s style might be called proceduralist. Like Cristi writing his reports Mr. Porumboiu scrupulously records details in a manner that only seems literal-minded because his technique is invisible and his intelligence resolutely unshowy." Adjective�۝ tells a small story well. At the level of plot it is consistently engaging and the psychology of the ambivalent detective a staple of film noir is given a new twist in the character of Cristi. But the more closely you look the more you see: a movie about a marriage about a career in crisis about a society riven by unstated class antagonisms and hobbled by ancient authoritarian habits. So much in this meticulous and moving film is between the lines and almost nothing is by the book."

the 18-year-old who ascended the British throne in 1837 and gave the Victorians their name she sits in her coronation robes staring straight ahead with a somewhat glazed expression. Her arms are white and fashionably plump her dress cream and splashed with gold. Her coronation robe a massive ermine-and-red-velvet cloak spills off her bared shoulders and onto the ground creating a luxurious puddle. She looks a bit bored ��� heavy hangs the crown or at least those opulent threads." the globular old lady shrouded in widow�۪s weeds and vehement melancholia and wearing a dour look that suggests that she was never amused not now not ever. That woman who became known as the Widow of Windsor after the death of her husband Prince Albert in 1861 is nowhere to be seen in ���The Young Victoria �۝ a frivolously entertaining film with Emily Blunt about the young monarch. Ms. Blunt who as Meryl Streep�۪s viperous assistant in ���The Devil Wears Prada�۝ slyly upstaged Anne Hathaway doesn�۪t have Victoria�۪s padding or bearing which is probably why she was cast in the role. No one wants to watch the lives and loves of the rich and dowdy." which is why what we usually get in movies about royal personages from dusty and distant worlds are sumptuous frocks soaring music a dash of intrigue and thunderous nonsense. ���Young Victoria�۝ ��� the latest in a long line of fictional entertainments about the dramatic if more often than not melodramatic ups and downs of female British monarchs ��� fits the bill nicely. There�۪s something about a queen that inspires filmmakers (audiences too) who enjoy pulling the curtain away from these most private lives and taking peeks under the royal robes. Because this queen spent so much of her life draped in black and gloom her younger self would seem particularly ripe material." at least here. Directed with some snap by Jean-Marc Vall̩e from a screenplay by Julian Fellowes ���The Young Victoria�۝ opens with some turgid on-screen text about her birth in 1819: ���A child is born.�۝ No not Jesus but little Victoria heir to the throne and the only daughter of the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and the unseen soon-to-be-dead Duke of Kent the fourth son of George III. But while she was born with a royal spoon in her mouth little Victoria like so many rich girls before and since proves deeply unhappy. ���What little girl does not dream of growing up as a princess �۝ Victoria asks early in dolorous voice-over before lowering the boom: ���Even a palace can be a prison.�۝" a coldness largely emanating from the duchess and her close adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) who keep Victoria under lock and key to control her and the power she will assume. Isolated from other children with only servants and a spaniel for company Victoria amuses herself as best she can. Ms. Blunt tries her hardest to interest us as well but there is limited entertainment in watching even an appealing actress wander forlornly talking to herself and the dog. Victoria it seems wasn�۪t all that interesting at this stage in her life (or so it appears here) which might explain why Mr. Vall̩e tweaks his material to the point of exaggeration sometimes to the point of parody as with Mr. Strong�۪s virtual mustache-twirling." the story of young Victoria is also the tale of her relationship with her young consort Albert (Rupert Friend pretty and pink-cheeked) her first cousin. Born on the Continent in part of what would become Germany Albert enters Victoria�۪s life obliquely first through the machinations of their uncle King Leopold of Belgium (Thomas Kretschmann) and then during tentative visits. There�۪s a political dimension to Leopold�۪s matchmaking but those details are immaterial to the romance that develops and deepens. Despite the filmmakers�۪ efforts to persuade us that ���The Young Victoria�۝ is a serious work and despite some tense moments and gunfire the movie�۪s pleasures are as light as its story. No matter.

�۝ written and directed by Scott Cooper is a small movie perfectly scaled to the big performance at its center. It offers some picturesque views of out-of-the-way parts of the American West but the dominant feature of its landscape is Bad Blake a wayward aging country singer played by Jeff Bridges." but very few American actors over the past 35 years have flickered and smoldered with such craft and resilience. Neither blandly likable nor operatically emotional this actor has a sly kind of charisma  and a casual intelligence. You suspect that he may be smarter than some of the characters he plays ��� the lounge musician in ���The Fabulous Baker Boys �۝ the deadbeat bowler in ���The Big Lebowski �۝ the egotistical author in ���The Door in the Floor �۝ to take just a few examples ���  but also that he knows every corner and shadow of each one�۪s mind." Bad who is  57 seems to be running on the last fumes of his talent. He drives from one gig to another in a battered truck playing bowling alleys and bars with local pickup bands and sleeping in less-than-deluxe accommodations. He smokes and drinks as if trying to settle a long-ago bet between his liver and his lungs about which he would destroy first. The chorus to his signature song (one of several written especially for Mr. Bridges) observes that ���falling feels like flying for a little while.�۝ That time has long since passed for Bad who is scraping the bottom and trying not to complain too much about it (except when he can get his agent on the phone)." cheating love gone wrong  ���  a lot of country music expresses the weary stoicism of self-inflicted defeat. Loss and abjection are two of the chords that define the genre. A third is redemption which has also been a theme of modest regionally inflected American independent cinema for quite some time. So even before Maggie Gyllenhaal shows up as Jean a New Mexico  journalist with a cute young son and some disappointments of her own you can be pretty sure that you�۪re in for yet another drama of second chances and late-breaking epiphanies." Bad  has both of those things and enough professionalism to keep complete self-destruction at bay. Performing in front of a small appreciative crowd in Colorado he strikes up  an old hit and then hands the song off to the band so he can run offstage and vomit in the parking lot returning just in time to sing the final chorus and make eye contact with the groupie he�۪ll wake up with the next morning." settling into Mr. Cooper�۪s understated script as if he�۪d written it himself makes the answer both obvious and a little enigmatic. There is a playboy�۪s charm and an old-fashioned Southern courtliness half-hidden behind the weariness the anger at squandered possibilities the flabby gut and the unkempt beard. This fellow may be bad but he�۪s also dignified." as do other selections on the soundtrack (overseen by T Bone Burnett) which help to establish this fictional musician�۪s place in the actual musical universe. His main connection to the current country scene is Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) a former prot̩g̩ who has hit the big time and whose support Bad both desperately wants and is sometimes too proud to accept. Tommy is part of a slick new breed that pays respect to the stalwarts of the past (as any good country singer must) but whose smoothness nonetheless gets under the skin of his sandpapery former mentor." Bad pays the expected homage to precursors like Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell but really he belongs in more recent somewhat rougher company. Bad�۪s home ��� when he�۪s there ��� is in Houston and the voices that accompany his comings and goings are mostly drawn from the outlaws and renegades associated with Texas in the era of his early manhood. You hear songs by Townes van Zandt and Waylon Jennings and you may also think of Willie Nelson and some others. As for Mr. Bridges: he can�۪t help it if he looks like Kris Kristofferson and sounds a little like David Allan Coe." you might also remember Mac Sledge the Bad Blake figure he played in Bruce Beresford�۪s 1983 film ���Tender Mercies.�۝ Mr. Cooper�۪s movie owes an obvious debt to that one but there can never be too many songs about drinking loving and feeling bad and there is always room for another version of that old song about the guy who messed it all up and kept on going. Especially when that guy can play the tune as truly and as well as Mr. Bridges." smoking sex and swearing.

at a number of points ��� while watching Werner Herzog�۪s ���My Son My Son What Have Ye Done�۝ you might be tempted to murmur ���My Werner My Werner What Have Ye Done.�۝ The question seems reasonable all things considered particularly given that some of these things include buggy eyes galloping ostriches a samurai sword a mariachi band a pair of live flamingos named MacDougal and MacNamara and a little man who pops up as if he were an attraction in a David Lynch production." which accounts for the introductory credit ���David Lynch Presents a Werner Herzog Film.�۝ Several of Mr. Lynch�۪s past and present collaborators are involved as well among them the producer Eric Bassett and the actors Willem Dafoe Grace Zabriskie and Brad Dourif who has also appeared in a few of Mr. Herzog�۪s films including ���The Wild Blue Yonder�۝ and the recent ���Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.�۝ In ���Bad Lieutenant�۝ a relatively restrained Mr. Dourif plays a bookmaker opposite a wildly uncontrolled Nicolas Cage. Mr. Cage is not in this movie. Michael Shannon eyes occasionally bugging does the wack-job honors here." a fictionalized take on Mark Yavorsky a San Diego grad student who in 1979 stabbed his mother to death with a saber. According to news reports Mr. Yavorsky did the deed because he believed he was protecting her from a nuclear holocaust that was going to hit California and had become deranged while rehearsing the title role in a school production of ���Orestes.�۝ The California holocaust angle goes unmentioned in Mr. Herzog and Herbert Golder�۪s screenplay (perhaps they consider it a given) but a Greek tragedy remains as a narrative element though with little resonance or impact despite the yowls of the chorus." in the way of all senseless bloodletting but it isn�۪t interesting or meaningful at least in this translation. The movie opens with a pair of dark-suited detectives Havenhurst (Mr. Dafoe) and Vargas (Michael Pe̱a) motoring through the bright morning while trading banalities over coffee a scene that invokes Mr. Lynch�۪s television series ���Twin Peaks.�۝ (Vargas may be a nod to the Mexican detective played by Charlton Heston in Orson Welles�۪s ���Touch of Evil.�۝) A radio call leads them to a quiet street where Brad�۪s mother (Ms. Zabriskie) is getting cold in a pool of blood at a neighbor�۪s house. Brad soon locks himself in his and his mother�۪s home with a gun and two hostages leading to a standoff." Ingrid (Chlo�� Sevigny) and the director of his play Lee (Udo Kier) who arrive at the scene. Unlike the face-off between Brad and the police which plays out in the confines of a banal street Ingrid and Lee�۪s fragmented memories give Mr. Herzog some creative space in which to imagine what happened and why. Some of what he comes up with is psychologically suggestive and visually arresting. Such is the case when Brad Ingrid and his mother during a testy dinner that ends with a quaking bowl of Jell-O (the horror the horror) suddenly freeze a single moment lifted from the slipstream and etched into memory." though as when Brad visits his uncle (Mr. Dourif) who rants about chickens and keeps ostriches Mr. Herzog seems to be groping for some kind of meaning a way into psychosis or perhaps just biding his time which is fine as far as it goes. Ostriches for instance make for enjoyable viewing especially when they�۪re gobbling a pair of glasses or stampeding en masse across the screen in a cloud of feathers and dust. What they have to do with a man who murdered his mother is a mystery which is perhaps the point."

The difference is he loves interstitial living finds comfort and more in all the spaces associated with airports and airplanes or in what Walter Kirn in his novel that inspired the film calls Airworld. ���To know me is to fly with me �۝ Bingham says in the film like an airborne Descartes. It�۪s as if as a child he had heard ��� and heeded ��� the call of the female attendants for National Airlines who in the gilded flying age used to purr ���Fly Me.�۝ Back when flying meant soaring." this is now and this is here meaning the crash-and-burn-baby-burn America in which one man�۪s economic crisis is another�۪s golden opportunity. This is our moment enthuses Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman pitch perfect) the unctuous pragmatist for whom Bingham works if rarely sees in person. Some men hunt heads others ��� like Bingham ��� lop them off. A ���career transition�۝ counselor he crisscrosses the country firing employees whose bosses won�۪t pull the plug themselves. Racking up scalps and miles might seem like a tough way to make a living. Yet it suits Bingham a solo act for whom no hotel room is too depressing or crowd too lonely which makes him ripe for the dramatic picking." putting the character ��� and of course Mr. Clooney ��� front center and under flattering light as if he were selling a luxury car or diamond watch which in some ways he is. In fighting trim Mr. Clooney looks suitably sleek even when dressed in the generic business clothes he�۪s soon packing into a suitcase a task that�۪s captured in a series of precisely framed rapid   shots. Expressive of both efficiency and a routinized existence this sequence is itself an economic narrative device (one Mr. Reitman repeats). But it also comes across as glib a shortcut to character making it hard to know if it�۪s Bingham who�۪s the slick one here or Mr. Reitman." though Mr. Reitman is working harder than it first appears and more than he did in either ���Juno�۝ or ���Thank You for Smoking �۝ his only other features. The son of a funnyman (his father the producer-director Ivan Reitman helped bankroll this movie) the younger Mr. Reitman seems to have been weaned on screwball comedies ��� he likes women and teasing patter ��� and classic Hollywood is in his blood. ���Up in the Air�۝ is an assertively and unapologetically tidy package from its use of romance to instill some drama into the narrative (the book introduces disease instead) and the mope-rock tunes that Mr. Reitman needlessly overuses. When you have Mr. Clooney and Vera Farmiga on camera you don�۪t need some professional emoticon mewling away on the soundtrack." legs and intelligence flashing just around the time you think that nothing much is going to happen with Bingham. (A crash? a terrorist strike?) As Alex a fast-moving businesswoman Ms. Farmiga bats around the double-entendres effortlessly and brings out real warmth and palpable vulnerability in her co-star. To watch them together ��� particularly during their later scenes when they visit Bingham�۪s hometown ��� is to realize just how much alone time Mr. Clooney clocks in his movies. It says something about the dearth of strong female stars in American cinema that he hasn�۪t been this well matched with a woman since Jennifer Lopez in the 1998 caper film ���Out of Sight.�۝  (In the years since Brad Pitt has been playing Rosalind Russell to Mr. Clooney�۪s Cary Grant in the ���Ocean�۪s�۝ movies.)" who plays Bingham�۪s colleague Natalie ��� share the frame with Mr. Clooney as equals not props. The ferocious Ms. Kendrick her ponytail swinging like an ax grabs every scene she�۪s in which works for her go-getter (go-get-him) character who is sent out on the road with Bingham as part of an efficiency campaign.  She�۪s a  monster for our times: a presumed human-resources expert who having come of age in front of a computer has no grasp of the human. By contrast Bingham who fires people face to face with a small smile and pat speech comes across as the good guy though only if you forget what he does for a living." simply because he�۪s played by Mr. Clooney) so much so that it takes some time for you to notice the approaching darkness. Mr. Reitman certainly hints at the trouble to come: however bright Mr. Clooney�۪s smile there is something terribly off about Bingham�۪s blithe attitude both toward his own existential reality and his profession. Instructively it is how  Mr. Reitman circles around the character showing how   Bingham�۪s actions affect not just him but also those around him ��� including the people he fires ��� that deepen the movie if not its peripatetic center." �۝ which can be viewed as a well-timed snapshot of an economically flailing America appreciated as a study in terminal narcissism or dismissed as a sentimental testament to traditional coupling. A wedding subplot for one involving Bingham�۪s sisters (Melanie Lynskey and Amy Morton) which brings him closer to Alex threatens to swamp the story in sentimentality. Yet to put too much stock in this detour (which also involves Danny McBride) is to flatten a film bristling with contradictions. Certainly you can fall for Bingham maybe even shed a tear for him though don�۪t get carried away (as he does) or mistake him for some kind of hero. The truer tragedy here as the repeated images of fired men and women suggest doesn�۪t belong to him." based on the novel by Walter Kirn; director of photography Eric Steelberg; edited by Dana E.

During training Mr. Strel swims five hours a day and spends some of his remaining time in a cave. ���He believes �۝ Borut explains ���that if he thinks like an animal while he�۪s swimming the Amazon he will not get eaten.�۝ Given that the older Mr. Strel made it out alive he might be on to something." especially for weeks at a time and in ���Big River Man�۝ Mr. Strel is flanked by his usual assistants including Borut his closest aide who serves as the movie�۪s brightly descriptive often very funny narrator. Joining them is Mr. Strel�۪s navigator Matthew Mohlke a total dude who  used to push supermarket carts back home in the States. (���I�۪m just a fisherman from Wisconsin �۝ he says though he seems more Californian.)  Also along for the ride of course is Mr. Maringouin a multitasker making  his third feature who shot the movie on HD and served as one of its producers and editors. (Among the other producers are the singer Olivia Newton-John Easterling and her husband John Easterling founder of the Amazon Herb Company.)" Mr. Maringouin doesn�۪t feign neutrality. The movie opens with some text a quotation from the French writer  Jacques Pr̩vert which is clearly meant to give you pause: ���When I see a swimmer I paint  a drowned man.�۝ (The line somewhat differently translated is from the Marcel Carn̩ film ���Port of Shadows.�۝) The quotation points you in a direction certainly. But Mr. Maringouin doesn�۪t force the issue letting questions about Mr. Strel�۪s mission and his fitness physical and otherwise emerge from the material. This seems less a matter of ethics or personal reserve: Mr. Strel�۪s behavior ��� he drinks booze for instance while he swims ��� seems answer enough." slimed in Vaseline and lanolin (a precaution against parasites) slicing through brown water for hours weeks months into mesmerizing cinema even with lurking crocodiles. As his  attention to  detail and beauty shots prove Mr. Maringouin has a terrific eye: he brings you close to Mr. Strel sometimes within panting distance without forgetting the larger lovelier world. Yet as is often the case with documentaries of this sort which can involve countless hours of material it is the editing that distinguishes and makes the movie." Molly Lynch Mr. Maringouin has shaped a richly textured narrative about human endeavor that ebbs and flows surprises and touches and sometimes even disgusts (just a little). Mr. Strel isn�۪t terribly articulate: his son does most of his talking (and hustling) at least here which limits how far you get inside his head. (In one late scene though Mr. Maringouin expressionistically evokes the delirium and loneliness of his long-distance swimmer through a flurry of jagged angles and cuts.) Yet while Mr. Strel seems incapable of explaining himself the documentary which churns drifts and surges around him like water is finally an argument for wonder: Why does this or any man swim? Because as Mr. Maringouin suggests we are a mystery."

which may be why ���The Last Station �۝ a new movie about the end of Tolstoy�۪s life confuses the two. You will certainly see better acting in a great many motion pictures (including from the cast of this one) but it is unlikely you will see more. To say that the actors ��� Helen Mirren James McAvoy Christopher Plummer and Paul Giamatti among others ��� overdo it would be an understatement. I can�۪t handicap their Oscar chances but isn�۪t there a scenery-eating contest every summer out on Coney Island?" it is a great lusty laugh. When he shouts it is a deep abdominal bellow. And when he capers around his bedroom clucking like a chicken you can be sure you are witnessing a world-historical feat of poultry impersonation. Ms. Mirren as Sofya Tolstoy the great man�۪s wife matches Mr. Plummer howl for howl. She smashes crockery enters rooms in a state of operatic dishevelment or regal calm and seems determined to restore literal meaning to the word henpecked. Not to be outdone Mr. Giamatti twirls his moustache to denote his character�۪s villainy and Mr. McAvoy does what he usually does which is mime wet-eyed stricken lovable innocence but this time in a more Russian way than he has before." a nervous young man hired to be Tolstoy�۪s secretary. In the twilight of his life the writer has ascended from man of letters to spiritual guru attracting disciples to a vaguely defined movement led by Vladimir Chertkov (Mr. Giamatti). This utopian project which includes a commune of sorts not far from Yasnaya Polyana Tolstoy�۪s estate has alienated Sofya. She complains not without reason that Chertkov and his flunkies are trying to marginalize her and manipulate her husband into changing the terms of his will." while Sofya quizzes him on the state of his love life. This centers on Masha (Kerry Condon) a fresh-faced Tolstoyan who brings tea to Valentin�۪s bedroom at the commune and returns later to bestow other favors in spite of the supposed Tolstoyan commitment to celibacy." but ���The Last Station �۝ written and directed by Michael Hoffman (���The Emperor�۪s Club�۝) and based on a novel by Jay Parini is the kind of movie that gives literature a bad name. Not because it undermines the dignity of a great writer and his work but because it is so self-consciously eager to flaunt its own gravity and good taste. The humor is mirthless the pathos is daubed on like jam on a blini and the shuffling of books and papers substitutes for real intellectual energy. Mr. Hoffman has in press materials invoked the spirit of Chekhov but instead of the stringent sympathetic intelligence that Chekhov would have brought to this material there is bombast and grandiosity." because a rich and peculiar story lies underneath the histrionics. Tolstoy�۪s fame was an early form of modern celebrity with proto-paparazzi ranged around the gates of Yasnaya Polyana and the rural train depot that gives the film its title. His marriage could have been a novel in its own right an epic of loyalty and betrayal. His temperament as grand and paradoxical as any in the annals of literature.

�۝ Jim Sheridan�۪s movie about the effects of war on the family of a Marine serving in Afghanistan. Whatever the other consequences of President Obama�۪s revised strategy in that country we can be sure that it will yield more stories like the one told in this film. And it is sobering eight years into the war to reflect that in 2004 the first time this movie was made ��� by the Danish director Susanne Bier ��� it was just as topical and urgent." �۝ like its predecessor is in some ways less a movie about war than a movie that uses war as a scaffolding for domestic melodrama. It also follows the template of American movies about Iraq and Afghanistan in being resolutely somber and systematically apolitical: you can witness any kind of combat heroism or atrocity and see unflinching portrayals of grief trauma and healing. But you almost never hear an argument about the war itself or glimpse the larger global and national context in which these intimate dramas take shape." a reckless ne�۪er-do-well and a solid citizen who swap temperaments in the middle of the film. At the beginning a twitchy sullen Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) has just been released from prison. The crime that put him there is alluded to but never specified and his return is overshadowed by the impending departure of Sam (Tobey Maguire) for another tour of duty. Sam is a stoic patient man devoted to the men he commands and also to his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and their two young daughters (Taylor Geare and Bailee Madison)." Hank (Sam Shepard). A gravel-voiced former Marine with a grouchy demeanor and an unacknowledged drinking problem Hank makes it no secret that he favors Sam and can barely stand the sight of Tommy. And when news reaches home of Sam�۪s death in combat he all but wishes aloud that his other son had died." and the film lurches between moments of fine subtle realism and more frequent instances of blunt blocky overstatement. The change that Tommy undergoes in Sam�۪s absence ��� he straightens up renovates Grace�۪s kitchen and dotes on her kids ��� seems to arise less from the character�۪s psychology than from the imperatives of David Benioff�۪s script. And the story as a whole especially after Sam returns has a schematic quality about it." Stephen Holden referred  to the ideas of the psychoanalyst R. D. Laing who studied shifting roles and identities within family systems. The difference between that film and the remake may be that while Ms. Bier�۪s movie evokes psychological theories Mr. Sheridan�۪s seems to be applying them." �۝ Mr. Sheridan has an especially good touch with children and the scenes with Ms. Geare and Ms. Madison ��� grieving playing fussing with each other ��� are the finest and truest in the movie. Mr. Gyllenhaal and Ms. Portman whose role is frustratingly if unsurprisingly underwritten draw nuances out of the charged air between them. But the characters in ���Brothers�۝ are more shadows and ideas than flesh and blood. They lack specific gravity a sense of rootedness in family and social reality that would give ballast to the film�۪s intense emotions." he walks through his house like a ghost and convinces himself that Tommy and Grace were sleeping together during his absence. Mr. Maguire�۪s performance is disciplined but also strained as he tries to convey the anguish of a man whose personality has been thrown off balance by circumstances." well-meaning project ��� never quite pulls itself together. It has a vague half-finished feeling as if it had not figured out what it was trying to do. Which may amount to a kind of realism ��� an accurate reflection of where we are in Afghanistan." based on the Danish motion picture ���Brodre�۝ by Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen; director of photography Frederick Elmes; edited by Jay Cassidy; music by Thomas Newman; production designer Tony Fanning; produced by Ryan Kavanaugh Sigurjon Sighvatsson and Michael De Luca; released by Lionsgate.

�۝ Jean-Luc Godard once memorably said ���all you need is a girl and a gun.�۝ (A little money helps.) In ���Film Ist. a Girl & a Gun �۝ the Austrian director Gustav Deutsch complicates this witty deceptively simple formula with a wealth of found footage (material shot by others for other purposes) borrowed from film archives from around the world. As the title suggests there are girls (voluptuous ecstatic threatened)   and there are guns  (hard phallic threatening)  along with something of a narrative." this is nonetheless a story well worth considering and watching. Using material gathered from   the likes of  the Imperial War Museum (in Britain) and the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex Gender and Reproduction (at Indiana University) he has fashioned something of an origin story about cinema itself. It�۪s a tale that begins with an unidentified image of a woman in buckskin shooting at  some targets and ends with a cowboy bandit pointing his gun at the camera an image appropriated from Edwin S. Porter�۪s 1903 short ���The Great Train Robbery �۝ one of the most famous in cinema history. Tucked between these loaded images as it were is a vision of cinematic paradise found and lost." mysterious shot of what looks like an archery target in flames and some text (���at the first Chaos came to be�۝)  from ���Theogony �۝ an epic Greek poem by Hesiod about the origin of the world. The archery target gives way to fiery orange images of billowing smoke and some electronic thrumming. (The intermittent score tends to underscore the obvious.) The thrumming turns to droning the smoke turns to lava followed by more Hesiod (���wide-bosomed earth�۝) a woman with bountiful breasts ���Paradeisos�۝ (Greek for paradise) and naked beachfront frolickers." as you might guess all downhill from there at least on one level. Cinematically however there are more delights to come. In addition to being an estimable ���archaeologist of the cinema �۝ to borrow a nice description from the Austrian critic Stefan Grissemann Mr. Deutsch is a crackerjack editor. In the next section ���Eros �۝ for instance he intercuts images of a muscleman curling and uncurling his arms with time-lapse images of blooming flowers underlining the sensuous similarities between the different motions. But because he is constructing a story he then slips an image of a woman into the mix which adds a suggestion of drama (what�۪s she doing here?) to what had been an elegant visual comparison between man and flower." many beautifully and floridly tinted are sleeping dreaming and fornicating clothed and unclothed women. In one early section a woman drowsing in a steam room  seems to dream of  both an undulating jellyfish and a swimming man. In another section a woman watches a  man spin four strange dials hidden behind a  cabinet as if he were initiating her into a secret world. (On the soundtrack you hear ���she dies.�۝) A world a subsequent  shot suggests  ��� of a woman reading a newspaper with the  headline ���Cine Monde�۝  ��� that has been made   from images." �۝ which was created largely from scientific images and continued with ���Film Ist.

It is the only film in this series to focus on women�۪s roles as storytellers and repositories of folk wisdom; its perspective might be described as Inuit feminist." nurturing ethos is accentuated by the contribution of the French-Canadian singer-songwriters Kate and Anna McGarrigle whose searching folk ballad ���Why Must We Die?�۝ bookends the film. The lyrics which begin ���We are meat we are spirit/We have blood and we have grace �۝ evoke an ideal balance of flesh and spirit within a culture in harmony with nature in which the living seek counsel from the dead.

After fleeing home at 16 Pippa spent aimless druggy years hanging out on the bohemian fringe of New York. The younger frizzy-haired Pippa is played by Blake Lively (of ���Gossip Girl�۝) and the physical resemblance between Ms. Lively and Ms. Penn is striking." you increasingly realize that she is going through the motions of domestic bliss. When her husband�۪s best friend Sam (Mike Binder) describes her as an enigma he means it as a compliment. To Pippa it is proof that she has lost her sense of identity." it steers away from the weepy clich̩s and quasitherapeutic mumbo-jumbo that have given the genre a bad name. The movie gazes steadily and without sentimentality at upper-middle-class angst as old age and death loom and there is suddenly too much time to fill. Its refusal to push the usual emotional buttons and its insistence that we not pass moral judgment on its characters�۪ erratic behavior make it an exceptionally cleareyed assessment of a stratum of American life that Ms. Miller daughter of the playwright Arthur Miller should know firsthand." it is not strictly realistic. Pippa�۪s childhood memories are almost cartoonlike and the movie�۪s occasionally chirpy dispassionate attitude can be off-putting.

The movie after introducing various characters and relating the history of the institution a former monastery and later a tuberculosis sanitarium settles down to tell the story of Ragin�۪s downfall." �۝ the Russian submission for this year�۪s foreign-language Academy Award has a disorienting sense of time. Although set in 2007-8 the movie which has a scene in contemporary Moscow with traffic jams and naked dancing girls features Chekhov�۪s dialogue from the story published in 1892 conjuring a slower-paced late-19th-century life with endless room for philosophic rumination. The juxtaposition seems to imply that below the frantic pace of modern Russian life the same longing for ���the old days�۝ expressed by many of Chekhov�۪s characters still applies. When Ragin visits Moscow he disdains it as a city of crooks and stays in his hotel room." �۝ directed by Karen Shakhnazarov with Alexander Gornovsky from a screenplay by Alexander Borodyansky and Mr. Shakhnazarov also include home movies of Ragin filmed by his best friend Mikhail (Alexander Pankratov-Chyorny). There is no attempt to reconcile the two tones of the film shown as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center�۪s series Celebrating Chekhov: The Drama of Everyday Life." alcoholic doctor and avid bookworm to inmate kept under lock and key (and in one scene tethered to his bed) is hastened by his friendship with Gromov (Alexey Vertkov) a gaunt brilliant young patient suffering from persecution mania whom Ragin believes to be a prophet. The two engage in intense lively debates about everything from belief in an afterlife to Ragin�۪s certainty of the ultimate meaninglessness of life and death. In their most devastating conversation Gromov who has had a much harder life than Ragin accuses the doctor of being spineless and lazy for indulging himself in ���the sphere of nonsense.�۝" �۝ Gromov sneers ���and you think yourself a sage.�۝" an intellectual snob who laments that Gromov is the only person in this shabby dirty little town with whom he can have a literate conversation agrees with that contemptuous assessment.

�۝ an art-house domestic comedy with a tragic undercurrent about a family and its idiosyncratic cohabitation home is fun house and fortress both a bright spot a dark corner a place of play a place apart. Mostly though it�۪s a state of mind." though you can just make out the inhabitants who are playing a game out front shrieking with laughter as they crash and fumble in the shadows. The new day sheds little light even if through scenes that feel caught on the fly and snatches of conversation you soon distinguish the players including the mother Marthe (Isabelle Huppert) and her mate Michel (a slimmed-down Olivier Gourmet) a man with an abrupt unsettling laugh. Together the two live with their cat and three children ��� a young adult Judith (Ad̩la��de Leroux); a teenager Marion (Madeleine Budd); and younger son Julien (Kacey Mottet Klein) ��� perched at the very edge of a desolate four-lane highway." a word that might describe the family itself. The only car in sight is the battered station wagon that Michel drives to work and back each day as dutifully as any proper bourgeois. But little about this family appears correct particularly its living arrangements. A television dish has been fixed to a highway railing and a haphazard assortment of toys and household items ��� a barbecue a wheelbarrow chairs roller skates a small inflatable wading pool ��� lie scattered across the small front lawn and the road erasing the line between the two spaces. A fence behind the house meanwhile separates the building from a field that like the rest of the surrounding countryside seems to stretch on forever." though  signs of other life occasionally pass by including a cluster of Julien�۪s friends who roam around the area on bicycles as if on patrol. Julien and Marion attend school but like their father they journey to the larger world it doesn�۪t swing by for visits. No one in the family seems to mind least of all Marthe who bustles about doing housework with a vague smile or Judith who passes the time in a bikini indolently baking under the sun. This family which plays together and somewhat disconcertingly even bathes together (only Marion shuns the communal ablutions) has made its own universe its own reality too." in the form of a road crew does come knocking it isn�۪t unexpected for the family or us. You know something is coming just not what.  (The setup seems too strange to last and every tribe faces its extinction.) After the workmen in bright orange appear the big trucks start rumbling down the highway shaking the foundation of the house. The French-Swiss director Ursula Meier making her feature debut has wittily characterized the film as the opposite of a road movie ���it is its negation in some way �۝ which becomes more evident when traffic starts flowing. But ���Home�۝ is as with so many family stories also something of a disaster movie: the walls shudder and crack and eventually so do the people inside them." with no signs of strain that what happens in ���Home�۝ remains surprising and pleasurable even when the story goes dark then darker. Both the natural-sounding dialogue and Agn̬s Godard�۪s camerawork seem to generate from the characters organically which keeps them fully human. (The family isn�۪t the only group effort: Ms. Meier wrote the screenplay with Antoine Jaccoud Rapha��lle Valbrune Gilles Taurand and Olivier Lorelle perhaps to catch the rhythms of five voices.) For all their idiosyncrasies Marthe Michel and the rest of the clan never descend into caricature. That�۪s partly because of the very fine actors ��� with Ms. Huppert and Mr. Gourmet being finer than the rest ��� but also because the talented Ms. Meier has a particularly generous appreciation for the human comedy."

the heroine of ���The Princess and the Frog�۝ discovers. But to judge from how this polished hand-drawn movie addresses or rather strenuously avoids race it is a lot more difficult to be black particularly in a Disney animated feature. If you haven�۪t heard: Disney the company that immortalized pale pretties like Snow White and the zip-a-dee-doo-dah of plantation living in ���Song of the South �۝ has made a fairy tale about a black heroine a character whose shoulders and story prove far too slight for all the hopes already weighing her down. It�۪s no wonder she�۪s soon jumping into the bayou green legs and all." Tiana is just another child of New Orleans. When we first meet her sometime  before World War I Tiana (initially voiced by Elizabeth Dampier) is keeping company with her mother a seamstress Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) who sews princess dresses for Charlotte (initially Breanna Brooks) the pint-size daughter of the richest white man in the Crescent City Big Daddy LaBouff (John Goodman). Life is more humble back at Tiana�۪s home where her own father James (Terrence Howard silky as always) an aspiring restaurateur makes a gumbo that draws neighbors from their homes and later he helps tuck her into bed. Wearing work boots and suspenders his sleeves rolled up James cautions Tiana that it�۪s fine to wish upon a star but that hard work gets the job done." �۝ which the directors John Musker and Ron Clements who wrote the script with Rob Edwards further underscore when the adult Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) swans into the Jazz Age. Though the theme certainly serves the story ��� like her father Tiana yearns to open a restaurant ��� it also displaces race which the film given the commercial stakes cannot engage. Hard work separates her from Charlotte (voiced as an adult by Jennifer Cody) not race (or segregation). It drives Tiana feeding her savings and dreams. ���I don�۪t have time for dancing �۝ she sings. ���This old town can slow me down/people taking the easy way./But I know exactly where I�۪m going /I�۪m getting closer and closer every day.�۝" though also makes the adult Tiana something of a drudge and a bore. Like a lot of classic Disney heroines Tiana is good and sweet and pretty as a meticulously animated picture from the top of her sleek chignon down to her high-stepping shoes. Although she can be a whirlwind of activity as when she balances multiple plates at the cafe where she works double shifts Tiana doesn�۪t have the verve of the spunky little girl who bounces through the first few minutes of the movie. What she does have like most Disney heroines is a prince charming Naveen (Bruno Campos) a well-chiseled slab  from the fictional kingdom of Maldonia who rolls into town with a jazzy flourish and a devious manservant Lawrence (Peter Bartlett)." disappointingly if not surprisingly becomes not only Tiana�۪s salvation but also that of the movie largely by bringing some slapstick comedy and a touch of suspense into the proceedings along with the expected romance. Though he catches Tiana�۪s eye (and she his) Naveen is soon set upon by both Charlotte who�۪s angling for a match and Dr. Facilier (a terrific Keith David) a villain who as is true of many movies easily steals the show. As thin as an exclamation mark and just as excited Dr. Facilier wears spats and a top hat emblazoned with a skull and bones. Long inky shadows follow his every step sprouting around him like dark thoughts as in the bravura musical number ���Friends on the Other Side.�۝" graphic and surreal shapes ��� this number erupts early in the story setting false expectations for the rest of the movie and its songs and animation. Despite some ensuing comic relief largely in the hefty form of a musical alligator Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley) and a snaggletoothed Cajun firefly Ray (Jim Cummings) the film sags without Dr. Facilier and his menace. That�۪s even the case after Tiana in a sparkling fairy tale moment kisses a frog and becomes one herself a transformation that carries her on an extended journey through the bayou and yes into her own heart." notably in the strange swampy residence of an ancient conjurer Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) who gumming her lines and charming her pet snake urges Tiana to ���Dig a Little Deeper�۝ (written like most of the forgettable songs by Randy Newman). Big girls and little know what happens next but my the movie takes an awfully long time getting there. That finale like the story itself represents progress of a kind I suppose even if this princess spends an uncommonly long time splashing around as a frog.

The word flashback hardly does justice to the episode from Harry�۪s old life ��� when he was a dashing sighted cin̩aste named Mateo Blanco ��� that lifts ���Broken Embraces�۝ into the company of Mr. Almod�_var�۪s other recent masterworks." 14 years before the bright blinded present Mateo whose surname connotes both innocence and blankness embarked on an ambitious film project ��� a comedy called ���Girls and Suitcases�۝ ��� and also on a headlong perilous affair with an actress.

It�۪s a snapshot of family bliss (the three are as prettily arranged as the bourgeois bohemian furnishings) one that the Swedish director Lukas Moodysson will before long and with great deliberation begin ripping to shreds. First though he sets the stage pulling you in with seemingly casual details and actions ��� a business trip a vigorous run a visit to a planetarium ��� which don�۪t seem meaningful in and of themselves." and uses details and actions to advance his story nothing in this overdetermined tale  is casual: Leo as it happens is jetting off to Thailand on a private plane and Ellen takes her run on a treadmill perched on the family�۪s apparently private roof the city spilling around her. Meanwhile down in the streets far from her highflying parents Jackie takes her nanny�۪s hand. A woman who ��� because Mr. Moodysson doesn�۪t want anyone to miss the point however obvious ��� is named Gloria (Marife Necesito) as in ���Gloria in Excelsis Deo�۝ or ���Glory to God in the Highest �۝ said to have been sung by  angels as they announced the birth of Jesus." Salvador (Jan Nicdao) and Manuel (Martin Delos Santos) live with her brother (Perry Dizon) and mother (Maria Del Carmen) in a nice if cramped home in the Philippines. The children miss their mother who works abroad to pay for their schooling and a home of their own that at this stage in Gloria�۪s struggle is nothing but cinderblock walls and a still-elusive dream. Gloria regularly talks to her children whose photos decorate her small room in the big loft cooing endearments into her cellphone. The boys understandably miss her ��� please please come home they plead ��� but Gloria must make money which is why she feeds dresses and tenderly cuddles someone else�۪s child instead of her own." or rather human civilization. Most filmmakers working in fiction tend to ignore this kind of struggle unless they can use it for melodrama or tragedy as Mr. Moodysson does to increasingly blunt effect by fingering his villains and hanging halos on his martyrs. It emerges that Leo and Ellen have blood or at least blame on their hands. Their privilege marks them as exploiters however casual and na��ve never more overtly ��� or comically ��� than when Ellen apologizes to Gloria for a jealous outburst (over Jackie) a self-serving act of conscience that Ellen delivers while Gloria scrubs the family�۪s toilet." �۝ when a rich child eats her lunch in New York a poor boy in the Philippines cries. And so it goes as privilege begets exploitation with grimly deterministic logic and pages and pages of bad dialogue (this is Mr. Moodysson�۪s first film in English) much of it spoken by     Ms. Williams fine if floundering in an impossible role.  Mr. Garc�_a Bernal whose character receives a ludicrously expensive pen made with woolly mammoth ivory (hence the title) has a somewhat easier time partly because when he engages with another embodiment of first world exploitation  (Run Srinikornchot) she isn�۪t holding a toilet brush.

The battle scenes which involve vast fleets of mostly computer-generated ships sky-darkening volleys of arrows and the heroic self-sacrificial storming of ramparts are no better or worse than what any number of competent Hollywood (or Chinese) directors can turn out.

Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) home from Iraq with a medal and a reputation for heroism is given a new job in what the Army calls ���bereavement notification.�۝ Accompanied by an older officer a captain named Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) he shows up at the doors of spouses and parents ��� whoever is designated the official next of kin ��� to deliver the grimmest imaginable news. Stone and Montgomery are not trained to provide counseling or permitted to offer comfort but instead to relate the facts and circumstances of a soldier�۪s death." as when a father played by Steve Buscemi spits at them and calls them cowards. At other times as they stand on the porches of spacious suburban houses or cramped bungalows in New Jersey towns (they are stationed at Fort Dix) they encounter denial resignation or pure howling anguish. Most haunting are expressions of simple gratitude or compassion for the difficult work they are doing." and Stone makes a point of citing the rule book whenever Montgomery wavers or lets his feelings get the better of him. Stone a veteran of the first Persian Gulf war is less disciplined in other aspects of his life. An inexhaustible skirt chaser and an exhausting talker he is also a recovering alcoholic leaning dangerously over the side of the wagon." partly as a result of his temperamental gentleness and partly because he carries the weight of having seen things he can�۪t talk about. Neither a square-jawed stoic nor a seething kettle of post-traumatic rage he is rather both a vulnerable young man and a serious professional. The friendship that develops between him and Stone ��� a camaraderie shadowed at times by envy and suspicion ��� is remarkably nuanced and completely convincing." using his natural affability as a mask for his character�۪s pain and insecurity has never been better. And with this performance Mr. Foster having shown intriguing promise in ���Alpha Dog�۝ and ���3:10 to Yuma �۝ places himself in the first rank of young American screen actors. Their work is well supported by Jena Malone as Will�۪s former girlfriend and especially by Samantha Morton playing a soldier�۪s widow with whom he becomes shyly and half-guiltily infatuated." �۝ which Mr. Moverman wrote with Alessandro Camon has been purged of melodrama and also of the glum indie-film conventions that weigh down so many forays into local realism. Though there are a few scenes that seem more written than lived the film as a whole is remarkably textured with room for humor as well as anguish." a combat veteran of the Israeli Army making his directing debut (his earlier writing credits include ���I�۪m Not There �۝ ���Married Life�۝ and ���Jesus�۪ Son�۝) approaches this material with an impressive mixture of empathy and objectivity. He seems able to render the psychological complexities of war and its consequences simultaneously from the inside and the outside. No movie can convey the truth of war to those of us who have not lived through it but ���The Messenger �۝ precisely by acknowledging just how hard it is to live with that truth manages to bring it at least partway home." nudity and strong language."

Once you adjust to its stop-and-start rhythms and its scruffy looks you can appreciate its wit its beauty and the sly gravity of its emotional undercurrents. The work done by the animation director Mark Gustafson by the director of photography Tristan Oliver and by the production designer Nelson Lowry shows amazing ingenuity and skill and the music (by Alexandre Desplat with the usual shuffle of well-chosen pop tunes famous and obscure) is both eccentric and just right." the point  of everything Mr. Anderson has ever done is that truth and beauty reside in the odd the mismatched the idiosyncratic. He makes that point  in ways that are sometimes touching sometimes annoying but usually worth arguing about. Not everyone will like ���Fantastic Mr. Fox�۝; and if everyone did it would not be nearly as interesting as it is. There are some children ��� some people ��� who will embrace it with a special strange intensity as if it had been made for them alone." suspicious of authority and repelled by conformity full of unruly energy and wanton invention have a similar appeal though Dahl�۪s imagination was more aggressive than Mr. Anderson�۪s. The director has made the material his own by winding some of his characteristic preoccupations around the spare spiky architecture of the book turning Dahl�۪s tale of woodland derring-do into another melancholy comical study of the dynamics of a loving difficult family." old Foxy himself is a charmer and a scapegrace perhaps not as floridly untrustworthy as Royal Tenenbaum but not exactly a paragon of responsibility either. After a few near misses ��� and with a newly pregnant missus (Ms. Streep) ��� Mr. Fox retired  from the hazardous business of poultry killing and went into newspaper journalism. In enchanted talking-animal fairyland that is apparently a thriving profession and those of us in journalism who soon may be stealing chickens out of desperation may envy Mr. Fox the luxury of doing it  for love." Bunce and Bean the three farmers immortalized in schoolyard rhymes as ���horrible crooks so different in looks�۝ who are ���nonetheless equally mean.�۝ The voice of Bean their nasty cider-drinking ringleader is supplied by Michael Gambon and their escalating response to Mr. Fox�۪s raid supplies the movie with its basic narrative engine. Will they succeed in catching Mr. Fox and his friends? Or will he brilliantly escape their diabolical designs?" and perhaps for that reason Mr. Anderson and Mr. Baumbach often seem to lose interest in them. Instead they delve into the social and familial relationships that define Mr. Fox�۪s world with particular attention to the  rivalry between the Foxes�۪ only son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and a visiting cousin named Kristofferson (Eric Anderson)." handsome and athletic with the special sadness that in Mr. Anderson�۪s universe is the burden of the gifted.

Now in ���2012 �۝ his latest apocalyptic folly he cracks the planet like a nut splitting its crust toppling its mountains and cities and laying its every creeping thing to inevitable tedious waste." ���10 000 B.C. �۝ was widely panned.) To judge from the similarity with which he stages the multiple disaster sequences in ���2012�۝ ��� a limo a camper a plane a bigger plane and some really big boats by turns race ahead of the impending doom ��� he seems exhausted. It�۪s no wonder. Finding newish ways to cram large-scale carnage into a PG-13 package is tricky. You need enough verisimilitude to hook the audience but not enough to freak it out: the collapsing high-rises have to look real enough to be plausible as do the itty-bitty computer-generated figures falling from them. Swirling dust and flying debris serve that commercial purpose not rivers of blood and body pulp." �۝ and debris and bodies fly though at a careful distance. It all looks fairly convincing and also familiar: if you don�۪t repeatedly flash on Sept. 11 Mr. Emmerich will surely be disappointed. That gives the movie a cheap frisson though the larger shivers are supplied by the onslaught of pricey special effects which have grown predictably snazzier since his last cataclysm. Alas the clich̩s of the disaster narrative remain in place. To that ruinous end the larger catastrophe in ���2012�۝ functions as both the trigger and backdrop for a soap opera about a fractured family standing in for the rest of humanity which heals as the world falls apart. That�۪s the idea anyway." the central family here is as disposable as the billions of computer-generated humans that soon pile up after disaster hits. Written by Mr. Emmerich and Harald Kloser (they last collaborated on ���10 000 B.C.�۝) ���2012�۝ takes its plot points and shifting plates from both science and fiction and its title from doomsday prophesies including a myth about the end of days derived from a reading of the Mayan calendar. Though not much is made of the Mayan angle the most amusing character a doomsday prophet and radio broadcaster played by Woody Harrelson seems in hair beard and interests to have been drawn along the predictive lines of the real author Daniel Pinchbeck (���2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl�۝)." the movie sags done in by multiple story lines that undercut one another and by the heaviness of its conceit. Humanity is dying after all as the television talking heads keep repeating and while most of the dead are specks on the screen Mr. Emmerich occasionally brings you close to the calamity. In one scene a musician (George Segal) calls his estranged son but the phone is answered by the granddaughter he�۪s never seen. She�۪s cute but then her house shakes and she�۪s gone vaporized so that a sob can catch in Mr. Segal�۪s throat and ours." of course though there�۪s plenty of space available for synergistic product placement as evidenced by the Sony Vaio equipment that fills the government offices where the American president (Danny Glover) stoically stands by. Closer to the ground another patriarch (John Cusack) plays his part as a divorced dad who will be enlisted for the usual heroics while Amanda Peet rolls her eyes as his embittered ex. Depending on your tolerance for Mr. Cusack�۪s mugging she has traded up or down by landing a plastic surgeon (Tom McCarthy). Completing this family portrait are two irritating children a preadolescent boy (Liam James) and a younger girl (Morgan Lily)." as some sort of wizard scientist gets the chance to say ���My.

�۝ Richard Curtis�۪s fanciful fiction about rebel broadcasters who in the mid-1960s blasted British airwaves and eardrums with the Stones the Kinks and the Who among other youth-quaking greats of the era. Stuffed with playful character actors and carpeted with wall-to-wall tunes the film makes for easy viewing and easier listening even if Mr. Curtis who wrote and directed has nothing really to say about these rebels for whom rock �۪n�۪ roll was both life�۪s rhyme and its reason." the story opens in 1966 before the British invasion had breached Britain�۪s official radio channels run  by the British Broadcasting Corporation. In his book ���Selling the Sixties: The Pirates and Pop Music Radio �۝ Robert Chapman writes that the government�۪s cultural guardians responded to rock �۪n�۪ roll with degrees of indifference and hostility: ���BBC policy makers continued to go about their cultural missionary work much as they always had done selectively retrieving a folk tradition here acting as a kindly public service benefactor there bestowing sponsorship upon those deemed worthy of official approval.�۝ Although the BBC played a few weekly hours of rock it largely aided by the  government kept the noise down." pirate radio stations dropped anchor off the British coast and began beaming rock �۪n�۪ roll to a grateful nation (some 20 million listeners). In ���Pirate Radio �۝ the tuneful epicenter qua bad-boys club is a tanker on which some dozen men D.J.�۪s and various supporting players including a token woman (and lesbian) taunt the government scolds with Jimi Hendrix and Dusty Springfield. Rising to the rebels�۪ bait with increasing apoplectic rage is Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh wearing a mustache and cartoon sneer) a government minister who tries to shut the pirates down so he can keep the nation safe with regulated doses of high culture and educational programming." including an abstract blob that looks like a Henry Moore sculpture. Sir Alistair�۪s snobbery and paternalism make him the enemy and his position makes him a potentially interesting one. But Mr. Curtis isn�۪t concerned with exploring why gatekeepers might want to maintain the divide between high and popular culture. He wants to party. So he piles on the comic high jinks lobs the jokes and cranks the splendid tunes which is fine even if he tends to cue many of these for the hard of thinking: playing Leonard Cohen�۪s ���So Long Marianne �۝ for instance to accompany a heartbreaker named Marianne (Talulah Riley)." Carl (Tom Sturridge) who�۪s under the wing of the renegades�۪ leader Quentin (Bill Nighy reliably amusing). A tasty treat played by January Jones on hiatus from driving Don Draper up a wall in ���Mad Men �۝ plays an even meaner trick on another of the ship�۪s D.J.�۪s. Both female characters are irrelevant which sums up the film�۪s interest in women at least when vertical. The truer romance involves rival D.J.�۪s played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Rhys Ifans both fine who take turns stealing scenes as Mr. Curtis gamely invokes the spirit of Richard Lester (���A Hard Day�۪s Night�۝) and every so often throws in another meaningless aerial shot of the ship." drugs and well you know."

�۝ written by David Brind directed by Adam Salky and based on their short film of the same title stakes out familiar territory and true to its name strikes out in some risky new directions. This high school semi-romance which blends comic and tearful moods is at once more provocative and more contemplative than most of its big-screen counterparts. On television and in young-adult novels candor ���  or prurience ���  about teenage behavior is the norm but Hollywood movies tend to keep one foot firmly planted in a more innocent world." at least at first seems to embody an established teen-comedy archetype. She is a modest dresser a diligent student and generally a cautious sensible college-track soul. She�۪s also the star of her drama class but her interest in acting may have more to do with academic ambition than with creative passion. That at least is what she hears from an alumnus of her school now a successful stage actor (slyly played by Alan Cumming) when he returns to his alma mater to give a master class." he is transfixed by Johnny (Zach Gilford) her scene partner a lazy and distracted student with no apparent interest in acting at all. Johnny does however have brooding good looks and a languorous sexuality that might be called Brandoesque. (The scene he and Alexa have prepared is from ���A Streetcar Named Desire.�۝)" at a party she hadn�۪t planned on attending Alexa throws herself at Johnny relieving herself of her virginity in an act of calculated recklessness. Her best friend a timid sexually confused nerd named Ben (Ashley Springer) follows suit and a wobbly bisexual triangle takes shape." ���Dare�۝ lays out some interesting psychological puzzles though the filmmakers lack the technique to explore them as thoroughly as you might wish. The film�۪s tone falters at times but nonetheless remains focused on intriguing questions about the nature of social and erotic power. Most interesting is the way the perspective shifts so that Alexa and Ben who start out as misfits in thrall to Johnny�۪s charisma end up using him for their own purposes even as his vulnerability becomes increasingly apparent." Mr. Gilford and Mr. Springer handle this material a bit more deftly than the director does and keep the movie engaging even when it slips and wanders. ���Dare�۝ feels a bit unfinished at once overreaching and underrealized.

These men and women some of whom have regrouped into new couples after the death of their partners vacation together not to mull over the past but because their suffering is a base line they hold in common and  see little reason to announce ��� at least until a filmmaker comes to call.

The lyrically complicating hand of Mr. Maysles who shot the film with several collaborators is everywhere apparent in the way the camera picks  a path around coherence refusing narrative in favor of the thick detail of life unfolding: a small sea of umbrellas drips on a patio; several old women hobble from the clubhouse with plastic bags protecting their heads from an unexpected rain shower." or the recollection by another resident of the exact time of day the Germans entered Lodz and hanged a Jew in public as a warning to the rest." he nimbly avoids an inspirational ending a pipe dream for those who have seen the worst that man can do.

Several believe they survived through God�۪s help or because they were poor and knew better than the rich how to endure; others are convinced that dumb luck saved them.

the Harlem teenager at the center of ���Precious: Based on the Novel ���Push�۪ by Sapphire �۝ lives in a world of specific and overwhelming horror. She goes by her middle name Precious which seems like a cruel taunt since nearly everyone around her thinks she�۪s worthless and lets her know it." Mary played with operatic fervor by the comedian Mo�۪Nique dispenses a daily ration of humiliation and abuse. The constant verbal and physical violence she directs at her daughter would be shocking even without the monstrous crime that hangs over their dim dirty apartment like a cloud. Precious overweight and illiterate ��� and played by an extraordinarily poised first-time actress named Gabourey Sidibe  ��� has a young daughter and is pregnant for a second time. The father in both cases who is nowhere to be seen is Precious�۪s father too." a first-person narrative composed in rough stylized dialect. In Lee Daniels�۪s risky remarkable film adaptation written by Geoffrey Fletcher the facts of Precious�۪s life are also laid out with unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail). But just as ���Push�۝ achieves an eloquence that makes it far more than a fictional diary of extreme dysfunction so too does ���Precious�۝ avoid the traps of well-meaning preachy lower-depths realism. It howls and stammers but it also sings." directing his second feature (after the vivid and eccentric ���Shadowboxer�۝) is not afraid to mix styles and genres. In his determination to do justice to Claireece�۪s inner life as well as to her circumstances he allows splashes of fantasy daubs of humor and floods of unabashed melodrama into the drab landscape of her struggle. Ugliness is all around her but beauty is there too." which extends from the casting ��� pop stars and television personalities alongside trained and untrained actors ��� to the visual textures and the soundtrack music. ���Precious�۝ is a hybrid a mash-up that might have been ungainly but that manages to be graceful instead. It�۪s partly a bootstrap drama of resilience and redemption complete with a hardworking teacher (Paula Patton) wrangling a classroom full of disadvantaged girls. It�۪s also the nearly Gothic story of a child tormented by the cruelty of adults as lurid as a Victorian potboiler or a modern-day tell-all memoir." brimming with rage thwarted love and plain meanness is a character bound to provoke discomfort. Even otherwise misogynistic hip-hop artists will pay tribute to the heroism of African-American mothers and to see that piety so thoroughly dispensed with is downright shocking." and in the fantasy sequences that provide escape from her pain Precious hobnobs with handsome boys but otherwise the only male character of significance is a hospital worker played by Lenny Kravitz. Otherwise Precious�۪s cosmos for better and for worse is a universe of women: the social worker (Mariah Carey scrubbed of any vestige of divahood); the teacher Ms. Rain; her co-worker in the remedial education program played by the comedian and talk show host Sherri Shepherd; and Precious�۪s fellow students." aunts and sisters who together provide Precious with a more functional family (to say the least) than what she has at home. But their love is also enabled by institutions and government policies. An unstated but self-evident moral of ���Precious �۝ set during Ronald Reagan�۪s presidency and based on a book published in the year of Bill Clinton�۪s welfare reform is that government can provide not only a safety net but also in small and consequential ways a lifeline." in any case less the examination of a social problem than the illumination of an individual�۪s painful and partial self-realization. Inarticulate and emotionally shut down her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place Precious is also perceptive and shrewd possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look. At its plainest and most persuasive her story is that of a writer discovering a voice. ���These people talked like TV stations I didn�۪t even watch �۝ she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell) displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance." perhaps the least-known member of this movie�۪s unusual cast is also the glue that holds it together.

that depends. Factor in variables like personal ideology current-affairs savvy and where you land on the temperamental continuum between optimism and pessimism and you will leave the theater either fortified with told-you-so smugness or slightly wobbly on your pins. A chilling monologue of imminent catastrophe ���Collapse�۝ is not just sobering; it�۪s a full-on assault. Filmed over two days last March in the basement of an abandoned meatpacking plant in downtown Los Angeles it showcases the singular obsession of the author Michael C. Ruppert a former Los Angeles police officer and investigative journalist who has seen industrial society�۪s tipping point ��� in the rearview mirror." Mr. Ruppert has devoted his life two books and a self-published newsletter to connecting the dots between population economics and energy and concluding that the center will not hold. Lucidly and with weary conviction he cites evidence for a declining global oil supply (like costly offshore drilling in Saudi Arabia) and demolishes hopes pinned on substitutes like ethanol (���a complete joke�۝) and clean coal (���no such thing�۝)." and since the majority of his premises are verifiable any weakness in his argument lies in inferences so terrifying that reasonable listeners may find themselves taking his advice and stocking up on organic seeds. (Those with no access to land can postapocalypse use them as currency.)" ���Collapse�۝  ���  based on Mr. Ruppert�۪s book ���A Presidential Energy Policy�۝ ��� is for the most part just a man a chair and a smoking cigarette. The austerity of the surroundings evokes both a monk�۪s quarters and a prison cell. Along with the predatory camera and agitated Philip Glass-style score (by Didier Leplae and Joe Wong) the setting  seems designed to kindle associations with the  work  of Errol Morris particularly his filming of Robert S. McNamara in  ���The Fog of War.�۝" Chris Smith heighten the resemblance though where Mr. Morris  adopted   an insistent bullying tone Mr. Smith sounds more detached. At times the film dances dangerously close to parody revealing a faintly mocking undercurrent that surfaces when for instance Mr. Ruppert expresses his belief that those running the world have lost control and the director cuts to stock footage of  what appears to be the captain of the Titanic." but it�۪s clear that he shares with Mr. Morris an attraction to people gripped by vainglorious passions. His style however can verge on cruel: his ghoulish attention to the ailing uncle of Mark Borchardt the Milwaukee misfit at the center of the 1999 documentary ���American Movie �۝ suggests a filmmaker troublingly lacking in empathy. Here his clinical interrogation-style setup of Mr. Ruppert may be inspired by his subject�۪s past confrontation with the C.I.A. but it also plucks uncomfortably at the fine line between shining a light on society�۪s outsiders and exploiting them." if there is one misfires. Maintaining his dignity in an environment that seems custom designed to diminish him Mr. Ruppert who looks like your favorite high-school math teacher and lives in California with his beloved dog Rags resists becoming merely an oddball specimen. Presiding over collapses both financial (he is currently behind on his rent and facing eviction) and spiritual he exhibits the deflated resignation of someone who�۪s tired of banging a drum that few care to hear." �۝ he blurts out emotionally as the film is winding down and the outburst is unexpectedly moving. Delusional thinker or tragic prophet (he predicted the current financial crisis almost five years ago) Mr. Ruppert emerges finally as an authentic human being sympathetic even when the film that embraces him is not."

Abner isn�۪t especially likable. He has always loathed the Choat clan which he denounces to Lonzo�۪s face as ���white trash �۝ once he arrives to find his farm occupied. During Abner�۪s confrontations with his son who urges him to return to the nursing home we learn that Abner was a stern withholding father and a difficult husband to his wife Ellen (Mr. Holbrook�۪s real-life wife Dixie Carter shown in flashback sharing loving glances with him). When addressing younger people he has the habit of beginning a sentence with ���The trouble with your generation. ...�۝" he takes up residence in a sharecropper shack on the property hoping that Lonzo who subsists on disability payments from an accident involving falling lumber won�۪t make enough money from the farm to exercise the purchase option in the lease agreement. Scenes of Lonzo and his wife Ludie (Carrie Preston) arguing about money reveal the desperation of Lonzo�۪s circumstances." Pamela (Mia Wasikowska) whom Lonzo keeps tightly under his thumb.

two adjectives which also describe his performance in this likable lightweight absurdist comedy." double takes eyeball bulges and explosive gestures he leaps in the air and splats in the sand with cartoon abandon buoyed by the jokes and the big bounce of his own stardom." Lyn looks as if he could have been drawn by Milton Caniff the creator of the comic-strip tough guy Steve Canyon. Instead Lyn has been drawn in crude if generally effective strokes by Mr. Clooney and his producing partner Grant Heslov who together also wrote ���Good Night and Good Luck.�۝ Mr. Clooney directed that film but for this one Mr. Heslov has moved behind the camera to make a somewhat ragged directing debut. Though he never settles into a groove moving between would-be parody and could-be sincerity Mr. Heslov does keep the parts more or less in play aided by the outlandishness of his story and by the performances of Mr. Clooney Jeff Bridges and Stephen Lang." also titled ���The Men Who Stare at Goats �۝ the film tells parallel stories that finally join. One involves a journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) who after his marriage tanks heads to Iraq to give his life meaning. What he discovers is Lyn a recruit in the mysterious New Earth Army an experimental Army program centered on parapsychology that was developed by a Vietnam vet Bill Django (Mr. Bridges) and pushed into creation by the gonzo General Hopgood (Mr. Lang). Realizing that he has the makings of a juicy story Bob tags after Lyn a decision that leads him both into Iraq and Lyn�۪s past in the New Earth Army." born in the fields of Vietnam and baptized in the hot tubs of the New Age movement brings together Buddhism pantheism militarism and old-fashioned hooey-ism the idea being that war can be waged with love eagle feathers and assorted paranormal techniques ��� with a few martial arts moves thrown in. General Hopgood and Lyn take to the program with a seriousness bordering on devotional partly because Bill or rather the irresistible Mr. Bridges could inspire lemmings of any genus.   His batty smile and loosey-goosey gestural performance which brings to mind a modern dance teacher stoned on good vibes perfectly complements Mr. Lang�۪s spring-loaded turn. (Mr. Lang is having a very nice year with roles  also in Michael Mann�۪s ���Public Enemies�۝ and James Cameron�۪s ���Avatar.�۝)" especially during the flashbacks when he�۪s forced into a sloppy pageboy he seems to be enjoying the joke too much. What makes Mr. Lang�۪s performance work so well is its unwavering seriousness: he never lets self-amusement cloud his eyes or his acting. Not so Mr. McGregor a predictably attractive if superfluous  presence. What makes this a story worth telling it emerges quickly isn�۪t the journalist but the men who thought they could travel the world or stop a goat�۪s heart with their minds. The journalist hook is an easy way into the material but both Bob and the flashbacks which probably account for some of Mr. Heslov�۪s unsteadiness get in the way." including another New Earth Army member played by an agreeably malevolent Kevin Spacey and many goats. (They stare right back by the way.) They�۪re all fine company but like Bob and Lyn�۪s drifting adventures in Iraq which finds them tooling down dusty roads on a mystery mission they don�۪t leave much of a trace. There�۪s a curious evanescence to the movie which while apparently based in truth ��� it recalls a multimillion-dollar project called Star Gate dedicated to parapsychology research that came to light in the mid-1990s ��� doesn�۪t add up to anything. It�۪s wacky amusing.  But that�۪s about it. If there are truths to be drawn from the military�۪s use of men to locate hostages psychically they�۪re not evident here."

the writer and director of the much-loved ���Donnie Darko�۝ and much-loathed  ���Southland Tales �۝ has a thing for the apocalypse.  Like those films his latest ���The Box �۝ is  sincere and sinister and inevitably ambitious a serious work that insists on its own seriousness even when it edges toward the preposterous. As in his earlier films he is again using genre (and pretty actors) as a vehicle to ask questions about the human condition (and conditioning) amid a thicket of high low and trash cultural allusions and against a backdrop of impending doom. But the end isn�۪t nigh in Mr. Kelly�۪s world. It�۪s here." puzzling through the great questions or fast-working himself into a creative impasse maybe all three. Based on ���Button Button �۝ a short story by the fantasy writer Richard Matheson ���The Box�۝ is the first of the  movies Mr. Kelly has directed that he didn�۪t write from the ground up. This doesn�۪t much matter because the original story which was first published in Playboy in 1970 and runs about 10 pages is merely a humble scaffolding for Mr. Kelly�۪s mazelike narrative with its sharp and snaking turns its periodic dead ends and various pathway choices." Arthur (James Marsden) an attractive seemingly happy middle-class couple who in 1976 are living  in a pleasant Virginia suburb with their only son Walter (Sam Oz Stone). Norma a teacher at a private high school and Arthur an engineer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who�۪s hoping to make astronaut live somewhat beyond their means or so she says.  There�۪s a sports car  in the driveway and Walter attends the school where Norma teaches Sartre�۪s ���No Exit�۝ to rich whelps more interested in her limp.  Perhaps it�۪s no surprise then that after they receive an offer to earn a million dollars they grab it." the payout comes with a shocking condition: they have to murder someone first by pressing a red button on a curious little box or so says  the man making the offer Arlington Steward (Frank Langella). Norma doesn�۪t seem terribly shaken by this stipulation or by the fact that she can see some of Mr. Steward�۪s teeth through the hole in his cheek. (Don�۪t worry about it he says and she doesn�۪t though I did.) Mr. Kelly doesn�۪t seem too concerned about the moral angle either which he takes his time getting to creating a needless complication in a movie overstuffed  with complications including severed toes watery portals to another dimension the Mars Viking mission murdered wives tall ships and even alas the twin towers." some does not. Sometimes this matters sometimes not. The actors are fine and to watch Norma trying to persuade Arthur that they  need to push the button is to realize that Ms. Diaz should go dark more often. Mr. Marsden seems a little lost (you can�۪t blame him) but he handles the story�۪s hairpins. He�۪s also better served by the digital cinematography than Ms. Diaz;  shot by Steven Poster the movie has been washed in 1970s browns that serve the vibe if not her skin tone. But Mr. Kelly leans too heavily on traveling shots here and his habit of slowly moving the camera toward something or someone a creeping meant to intensify suspense soon feels like mannerism." perhaps best known for his novel ���I Am Legend�۝ (the basis for the Will Smith thriller) has described the idea behind his short story as ���a sacrifice of human dignity in exchange for a specific goal.�۝  That more or less describes the themes which he bundles together with unadorned prose a heavy serving of dread and a gratifying blunt O. Henry-like kicker. It�۪s the kind of ending that can make you laugh out loud because the final twist of the knife is at once so expected and yet nonetheless pleasurable. (Part of the delight of course is having that expectation met.) Like many fine genre works the story satisfies your appetite for tales of this type and leaves you a little something extra to savor." Mr. Kelly has an uneasy relationship to genre or maybe he just needs a writing partner someone to help him edit all his bright and dim ideas. ���The Box�۝ is alternately fluid and inspired and rarely dull (though it is a little on occasion). But too often it also feels strained which might be expected from any movie that name-drops ���No Exit�۝ in one scene and the grim 1970s sitcom ���What�۪s Happening!!�۝ in the other. There are as with his previous films various visual gifts like the spooky image of an airplane hangar glowing in the night and the odd image of Norma�۪s little toe waving like a finger. But Mr. Kelly is so busy sampling genres and confusing the issue that he rarely gives you time or space to enjoy them.

�۝ written and directed by Robert Zemeckis a branded piece of shiny seasonal entertainment uses the digital technique of performance capture and the enhancements of 3-D projection to deliver a big noisy and sometimes terrifying version of the Charles Dickens tale on which it is based. That much is to be expected and the casting of Jim Carrey as Ebenezer Scrooge (and some of the ghosts who haunt him) might also lead you to expect rubber-limbed clowning and a motor-mouth barrage of semi-crude humor." in the midst of obeying the rules of modern-day spectacle it sticks close to some of the sturdy virtues of the source material. Mr. Zemeckis�۪s script retains much of the flavor of Dickens�۪s prose  ��� not just the catchphrases like ���Bah humbug�۝ and ���God bless us everyone �۝ but also the formal diction and the moral concern. The specters that pop out at poor Scrooge on his nightlong ordeal are certainly frightening (parents of young children consider yourselves warned) but the dread derives much of its force from the cruelty and selfishness that define Scrooge�۪s world." as in Dickens his stinginess is an extreme but hardly anomalous instance of a prevailing social attitude. The London that Mr. Zemeckis renders has a storybook quality for sure but a pall of poverty and injustice hangs over its brick houses and cobbled streets. It�۪s not only the ingenuity of 3-D that sends some of that shadow drifting into the theaters. And the ghosts are not playful spooks but rather symbols of the deep terror at the heart of this not-entirely-cheerful story governed from start to finish by the agonizing fear of death." his facial features exaggerated by the animating process and his voice a dry creaky growl takes his place in a long and diverse line of screen Scrooges including Mr. Magoo George C. Scott Bill Murray and Alastair Sim the British actor whose 1951 version remains definitive. But Mr. Carrey using the advantages of the motion-capture technique and overcoming some of its obstacles does an excellent job of showing how the character recovers his humanity." in particular the bombastic bacchanalian Ghost of Christmas Present. The three main episodes of haunting provide Mr. Zemeckis with an opportunity to push ahead with the experiment he has sustained through ���The Polar Express�۝ and ���Beowulf �۝ and they show mixed results. There is real sweetness and sublimity in the way Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past swoop over the roofs of London on their way to Ebenezer�۪s childhood home a blend of fancy and realism that feels both quaint and eye-poppingly new." show-stopping effects goes too far in particular a chase sequence in which Scrooge on the run from the skeletal ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shrinks to a squeaky-voiced pixie and darts through gutters and drainpipes. This attempt to juice up the third act with action-movie thrills is alien both to the spirit and logic of the story and it�۪s the one major lapse in a movie that otherwise strikes an impressive balance between sensationalism and understatement." grotesques and a few other major characters (Colin Firth as Scrooge�۪s nephew Gary Oldman as Bob Cratchit) Mr. Zemeckis and his effects crew create uncannily lifelike performances. But minor characters and extras have the cold rubbery look of video-game avatars (who are created in similar ways) and you can be impressed by the technical accomplishment that sets them in motion without being moved by what they do." without a corporate possessive attached to it ��� remains among the most moving works of holiday literature and Mr. Zemeckis has remained true to its finest sentiments.

�۝  his 36th  documentary in more than 40 years Frederick Wiseman takes his camera into the stately and elegant Palais Garnier in Paris observing rehearsals staff meetings and finally performances of seven dances including classics like ���The Nutcracker�۝ and spiky new work by younger choreographers. To say that the film sumptuous in its length and graceful in its rhythm is a feast for ballet lovers is to state the obvious and also to sell Mr. Wiseman�۪s achievement a bit short. Yes this is one of the finest dance films ever made but there�۪s more to it than that." the enthralling three-and-a-half-hour ���State Legislature �۝ is a must-see for devotees of Idaho politics. It certainly is but its greater virtue and the substance of Mr. Wiseman�۪s particular genius is the way it transfixes you with the inner workings of an institution you may not otherwise care about. The observation of groups of people functioning in a clearly defined professional or social context has been Mr. Wiseman�۪s primary interest ever since his first film ���Titicut Follies �۝ which exposed the workings of the Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane in  Massachusetts." and he forgoes explanation in favor of a visual version of what anthropologists call thick description." a process that is at once tedious and entirely engrossing. Though all the rehearsing culminates in full-dress performance ���La Danse�۝ really has no beginning middle or end. It is rather about two kinds of time that exist outside traditional narrative frameworks: the long slow repetitive cycle in which institutions exist and the fleeting moments of bodily motion and musical expression that make ballet such a singular and elusive art form." even abstract but it is really the opposite. There are characters events and miniature dramas that unfold in the course of the ballet company�۪s work. There is also a lot of talk much of it provided by Brigitte Lef̬vre the troupe�۪s artistic director and a rhetorician in the grand French style. It is sometimes hard to follow what she is talking about but her energy and cadences are mesmerizing." �۝ among its other observations emphasizes the distance between verbal analysis and physical movement. Dance is a vehicle of meaning and emotion but it is also a technical undertaking consisting of minutely controlled muscular movements. What goes on in rehearsal is the negotiation between art and technique and language is a paltry but necessary tool. One choreographer prattles on about ���context�۝ to a dancer who nods her head gamely but studies his body language more than his words. Another choreographer an Anglophone working with French performers forgoes words altogether communicating his ���notes�۝ through a serious of hums and clucks like a scat singer or a human beat box." on a carefully lighted stage and accompanied by a full orchestra you have attained an intriguing liminal status somewhere between spectator and performer." one that Mr. Wiseman in his patient meticulous magical way both restates and answers."

�۝ Hans-Christian Schmid�۪s dry concise thriller examines the politics surrounding the prosecution of a former Bosnian Serb Army commander for war crimes. Its United States release seems inspired by the current trial in The Hague of the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. In the movie his apparent fictional stand-in Goran Duric (Drazen K�_hn) is charged with supervising the ���ethnic cleansing�۝ of Bosnian Muslim civilians." Alen Hajdarevic (Kresimir Mikic) a gaunt wild-eyed Muslim who hangs himself after it is discovered that he lied to the court about witnessing events at which he wasn�۪t present. His death is a bitter blow to Hannah Maynard (Kerry Fox) an intrepid prosecutor who has just been handed the case by her cynical hard-nosed boss Keith Haywood (Stephen Dillane)." Hannah is given one week to travel to Bosnia to find new evidence against Duric. At Hajdarevic�۪s funeral in Sarajevo she meets his sister Mira Arendt (Anamaria Marinca the Romanian actress from ���4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days�۝) who has returned briefly from Berlin where she lives with a husband and young son." although because of time restrictions she can offer no assurances that Mira�۪s testimony will be admitted." in 2005 that shows Duric�۪s arrest  while on vacation with his wife and two daughters. The movie is unambiguous about his presumed guilt. In the courtroom he is a bulky glowering presence who casts a cold imperious eye on the proceedings." ���Storm�۝ is remarkably restrained. There are no flashbacks to the wars in the Balkans or to the atrocities in the hotel which Hannah visits seeking information. While there she is surreptitiously photographed and menaced by Serbian nationalists one of whom throws a rock through her car window." just before leaving for the Netherlands is thrown violently against a wall by a Serbian thug and warned not to cooperate with ���those pigs in The Hague.�۝ Ms. Marinca plays her as a worried but brave woman buffeted by outside forces as she prepares to unleash a flood of traumatic memories. Once she arrives in The Hague word is leaked to a newspaper of her presence and there are several tense moments that could explode into car chases and kidnappings but don�۪t. The movie�۪s central moral quandary is Hannah�۪s internal conflict between her desire for justice and her need to keep her job and play by the rules." ���Storm�۝ has so much history to impart in its relatively brief running time (105 minutes) that much of its dialogue (by Mr. Schmid and Bernd Lange) is expository. But it is very well acted especially by Ms. Marinca and Ms. Fox." she blurts out a question about the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that lies at the heart of the movie: ���What kind of court is this?

a South African woman whose race was classified and reclassified by the government then in the mad grip of apartheid. Born in 1955 to officially white parents Ms. Laing ��� played by an uncharacteristically unsteady Sophie Okonedo ��� was judged white. But when the child entered the larger world her darker skin and especially her tightly curled black hair marked her as different. At 10 she was dragged out of school by the police because the principal had decided she wasn�۪t white. The government agreed and relabeled her ���colored.�۝" when the young Sandra (played by Ella Ramangwane) is still living in her rural home with her parents and older brother Leon (Hannes Brummer). Her father Abraham (Sam Neill wound too tight) and mother Sannie (an effective Alice Krige) run a grocery store for blacks. A passionate supporter of the government and its policies Abraham insists that his black customers put their money on the counter presumably to avoid physical contact. Sannie seems more tolerant though she�۪s under the patriarchal heel. They�۪re loving parents demonstrably fond of their children whose physical differences (Leon has a lighter complexion) they don�۪t appear to acknowledge or even see until after they drop Sandra off at an all-white boarding school." each seemingly more improbable than the next though often drawn from Ms. Laing�۪s life. Sandra who had grown up believing she was white becomes a pariah forced out  of school then out  of her presumed race and finally her home. Shunned by whites she melts into the segregated shantytowns having taken up with a vegetable seller Petrus (Tony Kgoroge delivering the best performance in the film) whose smile grows dim. Heartache follows heartache as Sandra who had been reclassified as white after a court trial later tries to have herself racially recategorized so she can keep her family with Petrus intact." before and after the abolition of apartheid in various newspaper reports a documentary  and the recent  biography ���When She Was White: The True Story of a Family Divided by Race.�۝  It�۪s no wonder: it�۪s an emblematic tale of a woman whose body became a kind of tablet on which racist laws were inscribed. Her skin her nose her lips were all scrutinized. At one point in ���Skin �۝ a man sticks a pencil into the young Sandra�۪s short hair a re-creation of the ���pencil test�۝ used by some government boards to judge race. If the pencil stayed in the person was deemed black." Jessie Keyt and Helena Kriel and directed by Anthony Fabian (who also has a credit for the screen story) ���Skin�۝ is sincere and well meaning and tries very very hard to wring your tears. What a mistake! Crying at the movies can be one of the pleasures in life like sobbing over a book that has delivered a dagger right to the heart. But Ms. Laing�۪s story is a tragedy not a melodrama and it doesn�۪t need  to be goosed ��� nor do we. We don�۪t need  overwrought performances to understand the calamity of her life or to weep when her parents turn their backs on her. If anything the story demands restraint because invariably at the movies it�۪s the gentle touch that hits harder." Mr. Fabian directing his first feature-length fiction film uses a club whenever a feather would do. He also mishandles the actors in particular Mr. Neill and Ms. Okonedo both of whom have been incomparably better elsewhere. As the heavy Mr. Neill tends to turn the volume up far too loud so you can really hear the script�۪s weaknesses. The usually charismatic Ms. Okonedo in turn shoulders hunched and eyes often downcast gives a performance so recessive she almost slips off the screen. She might make you tear up. But if you want an honest cry stay for the final credits to watch some footage of the real Ms. Laing as a child happily and innocently tucked in the embrace of the family that betrayed her." more for emotional than for  physical violence."

There�۪s a formula to it one character explains a very simple formula. Yet while they know the rules for surviving a horror movie (no sex for starters) this awareness can�۪t save them. They�۪re well-schooled dead meat." �۝ at least when it comes to horror but the young director Ti West is. For his nifty creepy new film Mr. West a genre savant versed in classic fright and its self-conscious permutations has dusted off several durable motifs ��� Satanists the spooky house and solitary baby sitter ��� but ditched the now often tedious sardonic attitude. Instead of another homage (like ���Cabin Fever�۝) or glossy remake (���The Texas Chainsaw Massacre�۝) he has come up with a period pastiche that mimics the low-res vibe and look of early-1980s horror along with the same bad hair and clothes. And he�۪s done so with more shiver than splat." the story opens with a sophomore Sam (Jocelin Donahue somewhat goofy and sympathetic) renting a room in a house next to a church. This provides some nice misdirection: this isn�۪t the house of the title. Meanwhile our first look at Sam ��� who�۪s facing away from the camera stealthily moving toward her ��� creates an immediate and palpable sense of disquiet even peril. The tension eases when she leaves her new landlady (Dee Wallace) and the funky opening credit sequence complete with freeze frames kicks in. Yet even here the stop-and-go rhythm of the credits which appear over daytime images of Sam walking ��� and abruptly immobilized ��� creates an unsettling undercurrent." lengthy narrative preliminaries as Mr. West takes his sweet time putting the pieces in place including the slovenly roommate who forces Sam off campus. Among the other puzzle pieces are Sam�۪s friend Megan (Greta Gerwig) and Mr. Ulman (Tom Noonan) the  weirdo who hires Sam for one of the most dangerous gigs in horror a baby-sitting job. Mr. Noonan turned out in funereal black and making the eerie most of his sepulchral voice enters without his head: Mr. West initially frames the very tall actor below the chin for a visual decapitation that like the unappetizing pizza Sam and Megan try to eat earlier sends ripples across the otherwise banal proceedings." if not exactly doom then something icky and potentially hazardous to somebody�۪s health. And indeed pizza re-emerges accompanied by a more tangible threat when Sam who needs cash to pay for her new digs ends up working as a baby sitter in Mr. Ulman�۪s isolated spooky house. There after hellos and some further misdirection she meets Mrs. Ulman (the cult actress Mary Woronov) and a mess of trouble. As Sam settles in for her night of terror Mr. West doesn�۪t just rise to the horrific occasion he  also revels in its simplicity squeezing chills by turning on the lights squeaking the floorboards and in a heart-thumping scene sending his heroine up the unavoidable stairs." who also wrote the screenplay and served as his own editor is better at setting the scene than making good on his promise. The something wicked that finally does come in ���The House of the Devil�۝ is a disappointment which might be in keeping with his cheesier inspirations but doesn�۪t do justice to his movie. Still with four features to his name he shows a real gift for the genre particularly in his ability to generate dread with pinpricks rather than bludgeoning shocks something even veterans twice his age have difficulty achieving.

This lack of self-awareness is the point of almost all the laughs in a movie filled with unpleasant unattractive characters whose every facial tic and item of clothing seems contrived for yuks.

and in a curious tentative way so too does ���Michael Jackson�۪s This Is It �۝ a rushed and ragged monument to the man his work and the commercial interests of those he left behind. At once a greatest-hits compendium and a suggestive glance at what might have been the movie ��� which had its premiere Tuesday and opened Wednesday on a staggering 18 000 screens  worldwide ��� has been so nakedly designed to serve so many different agendas that it seemed unlikely anything would be left for Mr. Jackson�۪s fans beyond the sheer spectacle of such colossal posthumous exploitation." though it�۪s hard to know whether it�۪s the ghost or our love perhaps both. Whatever the case the on-screen results are weird and watchable by turns frustrating and entertaining and predictably a little morbid. Directed by Kenny Ortega the movie has been stitched together from more than 100 hours of taped rehearsals for the 50-concert comeback tour that he and Mr. Jackson were creating together when the singer died in June after a drug overdose. Mr. Ortega working with four editors (Don Brochu Brandon Key Tim Patterson and Kevin Stitt) has punched the material into classic behind-the-scenes documentary shape complete with teary testimonials from the show�۪s demonstrably wowed dancers the occasional impromptu moment and plenty of canned sentiment." after a bit of scrolling text on a worshipful note with a number of the concert dancers weeping and excitedly talking into the camera about the gig and their love for (the still living) Mr. Jackson. It�۪s an easy way into the material but it�۪s also smart partly because these tears help prime the audience�۪s pump. The testimonials add to the overall deification that comes with any larger-than-life star production. But more important they instantly invest some authentic feeling into a project (product) that has seemed devoid of soul from the minute it was announced. With their wet cheeks and halting words these visibly moved young men and women are the sobbing yearning embodiment of fan love." though you have to wade through a somewhat baffling montage featuring  Lady Diana Mother Teresa and President Obama among others a preposterous lineup that serves as something of a warm-up act for Mr. Jackson himself who initially appears among an excited throng to announce the concert that never was. Happily the moviemakers come down to earth (or as much as might be expected with Mr. Jackson onboard) for the subsequent rehearsals which are regularly interspersed or more rightly padded with interview snippets featuring  musicians singers choreographers and costume designers. Mr. Jackson�۪s family members are conspicuous by their absence his brothers father and mother invoked in name only." notably from the 1982 album ���Thriller �۝ beginning with ���Wanna Be Startin�۪ Somethin�۪�ʉ۝ and moving through ���Human Nature �۝ ���Thriller �۝ ���Beat It�۝ and ���Billie Jean.�۝ Some of these are accompanied by elaborate minimovies some shot with special effects including 3-D. The wittiest ��� a black-and-white Hollywood homage set to ���Smooth Criminal�۝ and probably inspired by the ���Girl Hunt�۝ ballet in the 1953 Vincente Minnelli musical ���The Band Wagon�۝  ��� features Mr. Jackson wearing a white pinstripe suit and interacting with Rita Hayworth (she tosses him her black glove from ���Gilda�۝) and Humphrey Bogart (who looking up from a kiss throws him a scowl). As amusing as this number is it pales alongside those moments when Mr. Jackson drops the pyrotechnics and just appears onstage alone." the visuals are generally soft almost smudged without the sharp edges you expect with HD. The softening effect most obviously benefits Mr. Jackson who�۪s rarely seen in close-up and instead usually appears head to toe energetically dancing strutting marching moonwalking and sometimes understandably panting across the stage. This distanced vantage robs the curious of a chance to scrutinize that famous face to unkindly survey the damage but it also gives you the space to admire his liquid moves as he slips and slides and glides. That�۪s especially important because Mr. Jackson who after all is in the midst of complex rehearsals he�۪s helping coordinate doesn�۪t often let loose vocally because he�۪s conserving his voice (as he sometimes mentions) or can no longer roam around the higher registers." raw unguarded right up until the day he died.�۝ Well as honest as a carefully packaged multiplatform pseudo-event like this one can be anyway. Truthfully it is hard to imagine  a supernova like Mr. Jackson in particular one who grew up so publicly and at times pathetically sharing anything honest much less raw on camera either because he won�۪t or he can�۪t. In the end all you can expect from such manufactured lives ��� and perhaps all that we�۪re really due ��� are glimmers of the figure left amid the fractured and distorting funhouse mirrors. Every so often with a shy smile a few soft words a direction to the musicians a thank-you Mr. Jackson offers you such a glimmer." with Mr. Jackson repeatedly professing his love for everyone and you know grabbing his crotch a few times."

Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) the series�۪s first artisanal torturer was killed in ���III�۝ and autopsied in ���IV �۝ but he�۪s still hanging around in ���VI �۝ smiling that crinkly smile in the never-ending flashbacks." �۝ which again stars Costas Mandylor as the detective-villain. The film goes all trendy in its selection of victims: instead of being punished because they take their lives for granted which had a certain classicism to it they�۪re now punished for being mortgage lenders or health-insurance adjusters." the quality of the torture machines and the importance of the rules that the subjects of the torture ���games�۝ must follow continue to decline. The ���Saw�۝ films have always been more about the gruesome toys and the puzzles than about the scares. In ���VI�۝ one test involves dodging hot steam. That�۪s quite a comedown from the good old days of being drowned in liquefied hog carcasses or having to remove your own foot with a hacksaw." most of it human."

�۝ a seductively fluid and tactile drama from the writer and director Karin Albou explores love and identity through the prism of the female body and the rights of its owner." ���La Petite J̩rusalem �۝ Ms. Albou focuses on the intense friendship of two 16-year-old girls living in Nazi-occupied Tunis in 1942. Nour (Olympe Borval) a Muslim eagerly anticipates her wedding to a handsome cousin; Myriam (Lizzie Brocher̩) a French Jew is furiously resisting her betrothal to a much older doctor whose money is needed to pay fines imposed by the Nazis." the girls�۪ bond becomes a compelling love story that will be tested not only by personal grudges but also by anti-Jewish propaganda and inflamed animosity for the French colonists. Against a background of marching jackboots and falling bombs the film�۪s women look to one another for emotional sustenance and Ms. Albou creates a marvelously fleshy female world in the casual nakedness of the bathhouse and the ribald humor of Nour�۪s engagement party." the film�۪s images (lovingly captured by Laurent Brunet) remind us that here female flesh is always the property of men."

It invites us to view the fictitious avant-garde musicians visual artists gallery owners collectors and critics trooping across the screen as fraudulent self-deluded buffoons. But at the same time it takes these visionary oddballs ��� and the art they make buy and sell ��� seriously enough to force you to examine your own reflexive skepticism." a brooding bearded composer whose cacophonous ensemble pieces for his trio New Sound Ensemble involve dropping chains into a bucket and kicking it shredding paper popping bubble wrap and smashing wine glasses. These silly pieces as well as some of the film�۪s more musically substantial ones were written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Lang who clearly has a healthy sense of humor." who supports himself playing Chopin in a wine bar where the piano competes with ringing cellphones believes he is an unsung genius. Grandiose and humorless he warns his brother Josh (Eion Bailey) that if he hasn�۪t achieved recognition in three years he will commit suicide." who in films like ���2 Days in Paris�۝ radiates the neurotic intensity of a Woody Allen character without a punch line. With his perpetually furrowed brow and hostile scowl he embodies the artist as a tormented egoist. Adrian is so self-absorbed and ungenerous that when confronted with experimental work in other fields he is as rudely dismissive as any provincial philistine." a painter whose blandly pretty canvases decorate corporate offices and hospitals around the country. You can imagine how Adrian feels when his father calls Josh a genius then growls to Adrian ���I only hope you know what you�۪re doing.�۝" �۝ whose screenplay was written by Mr. Parker and Catherine di Napoli is more interested in poking fun at the aesthetics and business of art than in exploring the relationships among its high-strung characters it shies away from probing the deeper ramifications of what looks to be a potentially lethal sibling rivalry. While it poses aesthetic questions psychologically it stays on the surface. There is little story to speak of." whose kitschy paintings keep the Chelsea gallery of his dealer Madeleine Gray (Marley Shelton) afloat. Josh despite his success craves the reputation of a serious artist that only an exhibition in the gallery�۪s front room might confer. But Madeleine who doesn�۪t respect his work refuses; he doesn�۪t need it she insists disingenuously." she is the only person in the nearly empty hall who responds positively to the music. Afterward she suggests that her gallery might be a more appropriate place for the trio and invites the musicians to perform there as ���sound artists.�۝" and they begin a secret affair. One sign that they are simpatico is that Madeleine wears chic noise-making clothes whose crackle is similar to sounds made by Adrian�۪s group. Ms. Shelton her eyes popping behind fake prescription glasses gives a bright screwball performance that recalls the frisky young Diane Keaton." ���(Untitled)�۝ spoofs an avant-garde tradition that goes back at least as far as Marcel Duchamp�۪s urinal. One of Madeleine�۪s stars Ray Barko (Vinnie Jones) makes taxidermy pieces that were executed for the movie by the Los Angeles artist Kyle Ng. They include a chandelier with stuffed animals a monkey inhaling a vacuum-cleaner tube and a cow draped with jewelry." a self-loathing conceptual artist whose works have self-explanatory titles like ���Pushpin Stuck Into Wall�۝ and ���A Rubber Door Stop Partially Obscuring a Door.�۝ The movie also lampoons critical jargon (���thematic content was pedestrian and the performance was anemic�۝) and collectors�۪ doubletalk." it is ultimately on the side of experimental music and art and their champions no matter how eccentric.

Having fled to Paris and washed up in a malodorous lodging house owned by the solicitous Mr. Jang (Kee Joo-bong) Sung-nam (who seems to have left his paintbrushes behind) is uncomfortably rudderless.

A chance encounter with a tart-tongued ex-girlfriend (Kim You-jin) now drearily married to a Frenchman gooses his libido; but even as she upbraids him for the six abortions endured during their relationship (contempt for consequences sexual and otherwise is a recurring motif) Sung-nam is eyeing the lively legs of Yu-jeong (Park Eun-hye) a perky young art student who knows something about evading responsibility." restless walkathon ���Night and Day�۝ delivers a convincing portrait of baffled masculinity and lost-boy lust unfolding with an immediacy that�۪s unexpectedly charming. Sung-nam�۪s randy peregrinations separated by on-screen date cards are photographed calmly and without the visual fanfare normally afforded Parisian locations. Skimming the length and breadth of the frame as casually as the human eye Mr. Hong�۪s camera is as open to distraction as his infantile subject whose frustrated desire for the ambivalent Yu-jeong is profoundly destabilizing." anger and contrition Sung-nam pinballs from one woman to another and from sexual aggression to prayerful remorse. He�۪s a moral metronome and Mr. Kim plays him with muscular purpose his stocky rather primitive appearance in perfect accord with the character�۪s bullish self-absorption.

In the meantime there are party supplies and a cake to pick up and a smattering of urban-parent rituals to attend to. The car must be moved for alternate-side parking.

Survivors of that journey recall their terror when the train was diverted to the Bergen-Belsen death camp  in Germany as negotiations with the Nazis stalled." although several young Israelis interviewed by Ms. Ross on the streets of Tel Aviv say they have never heard of Kastner. Initially celebrated as a hero for having saved more Jewish lives during the Holocaust than anyone else he settled in Palestine in 1947 and worked for the Ben-Gurion government in the new state of Israel." a rabble-rousing pamphleteer accused Kastner of having collaborated with the Nazis by failing to warn 400 000 Hungarian Jews that they were being sent to Auschwitz. A libel case brought by the Israeli government against Gruenwald ended with the judge�۪s ruling that Kastner had ���sold his soul to the Devil.�۝ Turning the court against him were documents showing that Kastner had written letters to war-crimes prosecutors seeking leniency for Nazi officers whom he had bribed to save Jewish lives." the damage to his reputation had been done and the reversal was not even front-page news.

This frenetic bumpy movie enters a crowded marketplace of book-based youth-oriented fantasy entertainment and perhaps inevitably calls to mind some of its competitors from the unstoppable (and soon to be concluded) Harry Potter series to most obviously the ���Twilight�۝ franchise." Mr. Weitz�۪s brother and frequent collaborator Chris has taken over that juggernaut of swooning adolescent vampire love the second installment of which ���New Moon �۝ opens next month. Both ���Twilight�۝ and ���Cirque du Freak�۝ plunge a normal American high school student into a maelstrom of supernatural warfare but ���The Vampire�۪s Assistant�۝ favors campy semi-comic grotesquerie over hothouse romanticism. Its wandering narrative and quizzical blend of the outr̩ and the everyday sometimes feel like David Lynch for young adults." garish costumes and stagy special effects in keeping with both the circus setting and with Mr. Weitz�۪s not quite successful attempt to meld disparate moods and tones. (Speaking of tones I should disclose here that the composer of the film�۪s score Stephen Trask is a friend of mine.) The movie starts out as a voice-over-driven satire of youth in the suburbs with shades of John Hughes and ���Heathers �۝ and then jumps from horror to melodrama to a kind of carnival backstage comedy." whose connection to the whole Vampire-versus-Vampaneze imbroglio is never entirely clear Darren finds a squad of human oddities including a bearded lady (Salma Hayek) a fellow with two stomachs (Frankie Faison) an indie-rock snake boy (Patrick Fugit) and a potential sweetheart with the tail of a monkey (Jessica Carlson). The show is presided over by an enigmatic fellow named Larten Crepsley played by John C. Reilly with an exotic accent and a florid manner that express above all his joy at being liberated from regular-guy typecasting." Gavner Purl is played by Willem Dafoe whose hollow cheeks and funereal voice (to say nothing of his portrayal of the old-school freak Max Schreck in E.

up in the sky! It�۪s a bird! It�۪s a plane! It�۪s Amelia Earhart! No it�۪s the strange somewhat surreal Astro Boy! Faster than a speeding bullet train more powerful than an adolescent girl or any other gaga creature that comes at him the Japanese cartoon robot has made the leap to the big American screen complete with a golly-gee voice (Freddie Highmore) a handful of obligatory action scenes and the usual celebrity add-ons (Bill Nighy Nathan Lane).  Newly revived he is again forced to wage battle against evil and more troubling endure some awfully cruel parenting. And so he zips and zags keeping aloft in a movie that can�۪t always do the same." Astro Boy ��� originally named Tetsuwan Atomu or Mighty Atom ��� made his debut in a 1951 manga taking further flight first in a live-action television show and then in a cartoon. (The Mighty Atom  was rechristened Astro Boy when the cartoon hit American TV in  the 1960s.) The character was the invention of  Osamu Tezuka a medical student turned manga and anime  visionary  who is widely considered the most important and influential figure in post-World War II Japanese animation. (American children who grew up watching television in the �۪60s will fondly remember another of his creations Kimba the White Lion.)" making his solo debut (he was one of two directors on ���Flushed Away �۝ from Aardman Animations) the movie serves as an introduction to Astro Boy and his origin story and no doubt a wished-for rebooted franchise. The story set in an indeterminate future opens with scenes from the life of a whiz kid Toby (Mr. Highmore) the son of a goateed  scientist Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage). Before you know it Toby has gone poof in an experiment gone wrong ��� involving blue energy red energy a giant robot and the insinuating voice of Donald Sutherland ��� leaving behind only a baseball cap and a strand of hair. Dr. Tenma subsequently pulls a Dr. Frankenstein and voil��: Astro Boy." heartache follows along with  adventure and various high and low cultural references some obvious (���Pinocchio�۝) others obscure (���Kiss Me Deadly �۝ another atomic-age artifact). It�۪s not inapt for a movie that raises the question of human consciousness to drop Descartes  into the mix ��� Dr. Tenma believes in the classics as do  Mr. Bowers and his fellow screenwriter Timothy Hyde Harris ��� but it�۪s a little kooky in such a kiddie-centric  movie. It�۪s also a throwaway as are the nods to Lenin and Trotsky that pop up when Astro Boy after falling to Earth as all heroes must encounters the Robot Revolutionary Front. Moments like these seem mostly designed to flatter the grown-ups. (Didn�۪t work.)" ���Astro Boy�۝ has been designed to function on different levels and serve different audiences but in this case these multiple meanings and points of address have created a confusion of tone. The story�۪s undertow of darkness pulls you in one direction while Astro Boy�۪s insistent cheerfulness which seems more commercially motivated than personality-driven pulls you somewhere else. This jaggedness extends to the visual design which at times intriguingly recalls the flat graphic style of the 1950s yet also often looks thinly conceived sketchy even cheap. Somewhat more rounded than the original character Astro Boy meanwhile now brings to mind the chubby mascot for  the restaurant chain Big Boy.

then you may wish to see ��� or perhaps I should say endure ��� Lars von Trier�۪s ���Antichrist �۝ a film that has already set off carefully orchestrated frissons of disturbance at film festivals around the world. It starts with a slow-motion black-and-white sequence scored to a Handel aria of graphic sex (with a snippet of hard core thrown in just for fun) and climaxes with two vivid scenes of genital mutilation." assaultive sensationalism that has made him both a darling and a scapegoat of film critics. But the formal rigor and intellectual brio that made his best films ��� ���Breaking the Waves�۝ and ���Dogville�۝   ���  as hard to dismiss as they were easy to loathe seems to have abandoned him. The scandal of ���Antichrist�۝ is not that it is grisly or upsetting but that it is so ponderous so conceptually thin and so dull." and arises from a precipitating calamity laid out on the very first page of ���Melodrama for Dummies�۝: the death of a child. During the sexual ecstasy of the opening scene as a nameless couple played by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg grapple on nearly every piece of furniture and appliance in their apartment their son a toddler climbs from his crib and makes his way to an open window. He tumbles out along with his teddy bear at what seems to be precisely the moment of his mother�۪s orgasm." �۝ divided into chapters and shot in weird pulsating muted digital color by Anthony Dod Mantle (���Slumdog Millionaire�۝) explores the aftermath of this fatal incident and expands on its implicit linking of female sexuality and death. The mother is mad with grief and guilt and Ms. Gainsbourg�۪s anguished naked (literally and otherwise) performance is at least in the film�۪s first half its only genuinely harrowing aspect. Following in the footsteps of Emily Watson in ���Breaking the Waves �۝ Bjork in ���Dancer in the Dark�۝ and Nicole Kidman in ���Dogville �۝ she allows herself to be pushed and provoked toward brave and extraordinary feats of acting in a dubious cause." playing her husband is less demonstrative. A psychologist of some kind he decides to take over his wife�۪s treatment weaning her off medication and subjecting her to his own methodology which includes drawing a triangle on a piece of paper.

the American aviator who disappeared somewhere over the Pacific in 1937 while trying to become the first woman to fly around the globe didn�۪t wear bodices as far as I can tell from the new biographical movie starring Hilary Swank. If Earhart had it�۪s a good bet that Richard Gere who plays her sensitive supportive quietly suffering husband George Palmer Putnam (G. P.) would have ripped or rather politely removed an unmentionable or two amid the civilized yearning and the surging swelling music." �۝ or at least in the score which works hard to inject some emotional coloring into the proceedings. The music screams (sobs) 1940s big-screen melodramatic excess and beautiful suffering." excesses of any pleasurable kind are absent from this exasperatingly dull production. The director Mira Nair whose only qualification appears to be that she�۪s a woman who has made others films about and with women (���Mississippi Masala �۝ ���Vanity Fair�۝) keeps a tidy screen ��� it�۪s all very neat and carefully scrubbed. I don�۪t recall a single dented automobile or a fissure of real feeling etched into a face. Bathed in golden light Amelia and G. P. are as pretty as a framed picture and as inert." setting records and grabbing headlines. In 1928 she became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic. She wasn�۪t allowed to pilot the plane forced instead to watch the world pass by from the rear. (���I was just baggage.�۝) Four years later she took the controls to become the first woman to fly solo across the pond. She then tried to circle the globe: ���Like previous flights I am undertaking this one solely because I want to and because I feel that women now and then have to do things to show what women can do.�۝ And then there was this: ���I am going for the fun. Can you think of a better reason?�۝" no I can�۪t though fun ��� along with nonpharmaceutical kicks and just the pleasures that come with being alive ��� doesn�۪t often factor into recent film biographies especially of stars perhaps because filmmakers think we need tears to wash down the achievements." �۝ Todd Haynes�۪s fractured portrait of Bob Dylan though even here the highest highs are in the filmmaking itself. Gus Van Sant�۪s ���Milk �۝ about the gay-rights advocate Harvey Milk conveys its subject�۪s joy but that exuberance is the beatific prelude to martyrdom." seemingly content in her marriage or at peace with its compromises and publicly adored. An argument can be made that her death was a catastrophe ��� a husband lost a wife and the world a feminist inspiration ��� but ���Amelia�۝ won�۪t or can�۪t rise to the tragic occasion. The filmmakers spend so much time turning her into a dopey romantic figure that they never give her the animating vital will or even much of a personality that might explain how a Kansas tomboy turned Boston social worker took to the skies and then through her deeds and words encouraged other women to chart their own courses." at 33. Ms. Nair recreates the simple ceremony ��� like many biopic directors she dutifully spins all the greatest hits ��� and shares Earhart�۪s remarkable prenuptial letter to G. P. ���I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly �۝ Earhart wrote. ���Please let us not interfere with the other�۪s work or play.�۝ The movie like some biographies reveals that some of that play involved an aviation entrepreneur Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor smiley and perhaps self-consciously artificial) whose young son a future writer named Gore (William Cuddy) asked her to marry his father. This affair though scarcely registers before she�۪s safely back in the marital fold." the filmmakers cram Earhart�۪s life ��� or at least its presumptive highlights ��� into a biographical template. In this mold familiar from many Hollywood and Hollywood-inspired movies the thickness of life is thinned until it�۪s as manageable and as easy to shoot and to sell as a bulleted checklist. Amelia flies. Amelia meets G. P. Amelia flies again. Amelia marries G. P. Amelia flies once more. And so forth and so on with the requisite period details (cue the jazz music and scratchy black-and-white newsreels) adding visual interest." Ms. Swank fills Earhart�۪s coveralls and leather jackets nicely. But there�۪s little to the performance other than the actress�۪s natural earnestness and smiles so enormous persistent and consuming that the rest of Earhart soon fades much like the Cheshire Cat. As usual Mr. Gere holds your attention with beauty and a screen presence so recessive that it creates its own gravitational pull." despite all their long stares and infernal smiling. (The movie is a more effective testament to the triumphs of American dentistry than to Earhart or aviation.) It�۪s hard to imagine anyone other than satirists doing anything with the puerile sometimes risible dialogue. The screenwriters Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan give Earhart a voice-over even as they forget her voice." she flies and most likely dies." based on the books ���East to the Dawn�۝ by Susan Butler and ���The Sound of Wings�۝ by Mary S.

growling beasts that roam and often stomp through ���Where the Wild Things Are �۝ Spike Jonze�۪s alternately perfect and imperfect if always beautiful adaptation of the Maurice Sendak children�۪s book come covered in fur. Some have horns; most have twitchy tails and vicious-looking teeth. The beasts snarl and howl and sometimes sniffle. One has a runny nose. Yet another has pale smooth skin and the kind of large wondering eyes that usually grow smaller and less curious with age. This beast is Max the boy in the wolf costume who one night slips into the kind of dream the movies were made for." played by the newcomer Max Records is the pivotal character in this intensely original and haunting movie though by far the most important figure here proves to be Mr. Jonze. After years in the news the project and its improbability ��� a live-action movie  based on a slender illustrated children�۪s book that runs fewer than 40 pages some without any words at all ��� are no longer a surprise. Even so it startles and charms and delights largely because Mr. Jonze�۪s filmmaking exceeds anything he�۪s done in either of his inventive previous features ���Being John Malkovich�۝ (1999) and ���Adaptation�۝ (2002). With ���Where the Wild Things Are�۝ he has made a work of art that stands up to its source and in some instances surpasses it." the book follows the adventures of Max who looks to be about 6 (he�۪s closer to 9  in the movie) and enters making mischief ���of one kind and another�۝ while dressed in a wolf suit with a long bushy tail and a hood with ears and whiskers. After his unseen mother calls him ���wild thing!�۝ and he threatens to eat her up he is sent to his room without dinner. But his room magically transforms into a forest and finding a boat he sails to a place populated by giant hairy scary beasts that make him their king. Eventually the tug of home pulls him back to his room where supper (���still hot�۝) sits waiting." through a Freudian or colonialist prism and probably as many ways to ruin this delicate story of a solitary child liberated by his imagination. Happily Mr. Jonze who wrote the screenplay with Dave Eggers has not attempted to enlarge or improve the story by interpreting it. Rather he has expanded it very gently. The movie is still a story about a boy his mother his room his loneliness and various wild things of his creation. But now there are new details and shadings to complement the book�۪s material like Max�۪s older sister Claire (Pepita Emmerichs) whose lank hair and adolescent gloom are touchingly mirrored by a wild thing named K W (voiced by Lauren Ambrose)." the movie�۪s Max is a storm without warning throwing himself into the story while noisily chasing the family dog down some stairs. Shot with a handheld camera that can barely contain the boy�۪s image inside the frame these clattering jangling introductory moments are disruptive disorienting ��� it�۪s hard to see exactly where Max and the dog are as you all tumble down ��� and purely exhilarating. Yet after jolting the story to excited life Mr. Jonze quiets the movie down for a series of flawlessly calibrated scenes of Max alone and with his sister and mother (Catherine Keener) an interlude that tells you everything you need to know about the boy and that announces all that will happen next." lasting 20 minutes or so are achingly intimate and tender. Mr. Jonze working with his regular cinematographer Lance Acord brings you close into Max�۪s world as he builds an igloo in the street starts a snowball fight with Claire�۪s friends and is left to weep alone after the igloo is destroyed. (When Max slides into the igloo the camera is right there which means that you�۪re there too when disaster strikes.) The world is cruel children too lessons that Max absorbs through a smear of tears and hurt. The wound doesn�۪t heal. Max clomps and then stomps and then erupts: he roars at his mother. She roars back. And then like his storybook counterpart ��� like everyone else ��� he sails into the world adrift and alone." which might come as a surprise to anyone who misremembers the original with its dark crosshatched lines; spiky emotions; Max�۪s many frowns; and the ���terrible teeth�۝ and ���terrible claws�۝ of the creatures. Though their conceptual bite remains sharply intact Mr. Jonze�۪s wild things are softer cuddlier-looking than the drawn ones because they have partly been brought to waddling life by performers  in outsize costumes. (The fluid tremors of emotion enlivening the fuzzy faces were primarily created through computer-generated animation.) The vexed whining caressing voices ��� James Gandolfini as Carol Catherine O�۪Hara as Judith Forest Whitaker as Ira Paul Dano as Alexander and Chris Cooper as Douglas ��� do the expressive rest." destroying their homes in fury and for kicks. Introductions are made wary sniffs exchanged. But these are his kind of beasts after all and so amid the rough splendor of a primeval forest where the air swirls with pink petals and snowflakes he becomes their king. ���Let the wild rumpus start!�۝ he yells as all the creatures Max now included rampage. It�۪s all very new (and scary) but also vaguely familiar because we�۪ve seen it before. The tantrums tears and angry words from the film�۪s first 20 minutes all start to resurface during this idyll much as our waking hours invade our dreams: the snowball fight is recast as a dirt-clod battle. Max plays the angry child and then the reproving parent." including Max�۪s melancholia which hangs over him his family and his wild things like a gathering storm. But childhood has its secrets mysteries small and large terrors. When a hilariously bungling teacher explains rather too casually that the sun is going to die the flash of  horror on Max�۪s face indicates that he understands that the sun won�۪t be the only one to go. There are other reasons perhaps an absent father a distracted mother. (And when a frightened Max listens to an argument between Carol and K W you hear the echoes of parental discord.) But such analysis is for therapy not art and one of the film�۪s pleasures is its refusal of banal explanation." Mr. Jonze lingers too long on his lovely pictures particularly on the island where the film�۪s energy starts to wane despite the glorious whoops in Carter Burwell and Karen O�۪s score. Mr. Jonze loves Max�۪s wild things but  you don�۪t need to hang around  long to adore them as well. Yet  these are minor complaints about a film that often dazzles during its quietest moments as when Max sets sail and you intuit his pluck and will from the close-ups of him staring into the unknown. He looms large here as we do inside our heads. But when the view abruptly shifts to an overhead shot you see that the boat is simply a speck amid an overwhelming vastness.

I Love You�۝ is the second installment in a franchise of urban anthology films that began in Paris and is scheduled to touch down soon in Rio Shanghai Mumbai and Jerusalem. My own sentimental heart is holding out for Dayton Ohio. Eventually like a cinematic version of Google Earth these movies the brainchild of the producer Emmanuel Benbihy will cover every inch of the globe with big-name actors and tiny romantic epiphanies. It may not be a project that will make the world smaller or friendlier ��� only perhaps a bit more precious." I Love You�۝ are all that bad. It�۪s a nice-looking city after all even if the interstitial skyline and traffic montages assembled by Randy Balsmeyer are about as fresh as the postcards on sale in Times Square. Each vignette was shot in two days and the roster of directing talent includes Mira Nair (���The Namesake�۝ and the forthcoming ���Amelia�۝) Fatih Akin (���Head-On�۝ and ���The Edge  of Heaven�۝) and Natalie Portman making her debut behind the camera. (She also plays a Hasidic diamond broker in Ms. Nair�۪s contribution.)" the stories have a  self-conscious sameness as if they were classroom assignments in an undergraduate fiction-writing class. Which in a way they are. Each filmmaker seems to have staked out a different part of town though only one Joshua Marston (���Maria Full of Grace�۝) has ventured beyond the tourist-friendly precincts of Manhattan. Apparently nobody loves Queens the Bronx or Staten Island. Or Harlem for that matter. And while the ideas of love explored on the East and West Sides are sometimes platonic parental or intergenerational they are also predominantly white and heterosexual." a pointedly non-hometown team ��� other notable names include Yvan Attal from France and Jiang Wen from China ��� to plumb the depths or mine the grit of the real New York. They have instead composed a flurry of valentines to a fantasy version of the city one culled from other movies and also from literature. You might get a hint of Martin Scorsese or Woody Allen here and there but just as pronounced are the inflections of J. D. Salinger Paul Auster O. Henry and many decades�۪ worth of contributors to the Talk of the Town section of The New Yorker." but somehow once they are stitched together the pieces of ���New York I Love You�۝ make up a parallel city that no one would want to live in much less visit. And this is in part because most of the New Yorkers on display here are confections hothouse flowers planted in a soil of arch dialogue and watered with studied sprinklings of surprise." at first to be. Thus the young man (Anton Yelchin) in Brett Ratner�۪s prom-night anecdote (in which by the way no cars burst into flames) allows himself to be fixed up with the daughter of an avuncular pharmacist (James Caan). The girl is played by the charming Olivia Thirlby and a morsel of drama is produced by her date�۪s discovery that she uses a wheelchair." but Mr. Ratner and Jeff Nathanson who wrote this section seem to be working in their literal-minded way from the same template as other more overtly poetic contributors. Chance meetings have a way of yielding  reversals that seem as diagrammed as chess moves. Men in particular ��� a young thief (Hayden Christensen) an obnoxious pick-up artist (Ethan Hawke) a middle-aged businessman (Chris Cooper) ��� receive comeuppances that only they fail to anticipate. The women who supply them (including Robin Wright Penn and Maggie Q) tend to be savvier and more enigmatic but no less limited." how shaped the chapters in ���New York I Love You�۝ seem given the current vogue for open-ended observational cinema about city life. I�۪m thinking of younger American directors like Andrew Bujalski and Barry Jenkins (whose ���Medicine for Melancholy�۝ could just as well have been called ���San Francisco I Love You�۝) and also of the filmmakers who have brought cities like Taipei Tehran Bucharest and Buenos Aires to rough and vivid life over the past decade." like Paris and Los Angeles is both overexposed and underexplored in movies and of the love letters assembled here only two linger in the mind after this 110-minute speed-dating session is over: Ms. Nair�۪s diamond-district encounter (with Irrfan Khan as well as Ms. Portman) and Allen Hughes�۪s impressionistic study of the anxious aftermath of a one-night stand starring Bradley Cooper and Drea de Matteo.

though perhaps more truly on behalf of the artists and intellectuals who have embraced them as symbols (or symptoms) of class and sexual revolt. This type of domestic violence has fueled the films ���Sister  My Sister�۝ and ���Murderous Maids �۝ each based on the true-crime story of the Papins French sisters and probable lovers who in 1933 abruptly slaughtered their mistress and her daughter gouging out the victims�۪ eyes. (Genet�۪s ���Maids�۝ is often thought to have been inspired by the Papins though this is disputed.)" the Chilean movie ���The Maid�۝ appears to be following the familiar arc of the seditious-servant subgenre. The opening portends the worst: a handsome family of six hushing and shushing one another light a cake and gather some carelessly wrapped presents while in the kitchen the birthday girl their grim-faced maid Raquel (Catalina Saavedra) pokes at the revolting brown mess on her plate. Is she eating leftovers or reading entrails that portend an approaching catastrophe? The director Sebasti��n Silva who wrote the sly screenplay with Pedro Peirano refuses to tip his hand. The presents are offered (and reluctantly accepted) and then Raquel returns to the kitchen that is her roost refuge and prison." and more appealing than its smeary visuals with their distracting washed-out colors and putty skin tones. (It was shot in high definition that looks closer to old consumer-grade video but is being shown on film in theaters.) There might be a rationale for the visuals (economics probably counts more) and you could argue this is an ugly world. But this grubbiness works against the movie particularly because there�۪s more here than meets the eye." realistic scenes of Raquel making her way through the large two-story house upstairs and downstairs often with a vacuum cleaner in tow. Her world is dictated by the home with its multiple rooms and dirty sheets and carelessly discarded clothes. Even her bodily rhythms are dictated by the house and its occupants." sends the children to school and wakes her employers Pilar (Claudia Celed�_n) and Mundo (Alejandro Goic) with a tap on their bedroom door and two breakfast trays. She dusts and scrubs her lips set. Her expression is fixed seemingly immutable much like her position in life. She seems a part of the house just like the furniture." and part of the pleasure of this unassuming movie is how Mr. Silva plays with our expectations some stoked by previous stories of this kind. The entrance of a new younger maid who is brought in to help Raquel sends an uneasy tremor through the proceedings as does the appearance of a mewling and clearly unwanted kitten. Because Raquel expresses so little she�۪s a vehicle for whatever fantasies you want to project on her. It�۪s a fundamental trick of cinema ��  when Rouben Mamoulian directed Garbo in ���Queen Christina�۝ in 1933 he apparently told her: ���I want your face to be a blank sheet of paper. I want the writing to be done by everyone in the audience.�۝" giving her shading some history a sense of self: Ms. Saavedra lights up slowly but luminously. The introduction of yet another maid Lucy (Mariana Loyola) takes the story and Raquel into unexpected rich terrain though here again the end result proves surprising. Mr. Silva likes to throw you off the scent tossing in nervous and comic diversions like a hilariously belligerent maid Sonia (Anita Reeves) whom Raquel literally sends up the wall by locking her out of the house. It takes Mr. Silva a while to finish his story but the ending of ���The Maid�۝ is so intelligently handled and so generously and honestly conceived it proves well worth the wait."

�۝ a blunt and sadistic revenge thriller starring Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler occasionally pauses from the mayhem to stage a solemn debate about law justice and morality. Mr. Butler playing a family man whose wife and daughter were murdered by thugs feels he was let down by the system which gave one of the thugs a light sentence in exchange for testimony against the other thug who was sentenced to death. Mr. Foxx the prosecutor who made that deal thinks that the system however imperfect did its job." ���Law Abiding Citizen�۝ has about as much to say about real-life legal issues as ���Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen�۝ had to say about defense policy. And it has less ethical gravity than any three of the ���Saw�۝ movies. Though it sometimes puts on a serious face this movie directed with snarling snappish style by F. Gary Gray (���The Italian Job�۝) wears its preposterousness with a certain pride. It�۪s about the cat-and-mouse game between two very smart guys and it�۪s perfectly happy to be as dumb as it wants."

pre-cable days ���Wide World of Sports�۝ on ABC used to promise ���the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.�۝ That famous catchphrase contained an implicit recognition of a fact seldom acknowledged in America�۪s triumphalist sports culture namely that failure can be as compelling as success sometimes even more so." ���The Damned United�۝ is the rare sports movie that deals with ��� indeed positively relishes ��� humiliation and disappointment. Its real-life protagonist the soccer coach Brian Clough (who died in 2004) was over his long career a winner with an extraordinary record of accomplishment.

Clough (Michael Sheen) perhaps uniquely in the annals of sporting cinema reverses the process. Hired with great fanfare in 1974 to manage the mighty Leeds United club he alienates players fans and management and sends the team into a tailspin. At his very first practice he tells the Leeds stars who play a rough mean brand of football that they are not champions but thugs and cheaters. Oddly they resist his invitation to reform their ways." charismatic leader. Clough takes over Leeds after its longtime manager Don Revie (Colm Meaney) assumes the leadership of the English national team. Over the years Revie has become the personification of his team and a hero of West Yorkshire. A hard act for anyone to follow but especially vexing for Clough whose obsession with Revie ��� a combination of rivalry and idolatry visceral loathing and disappointed love ��� turns out to be as much a driving force in his career as his own ambition." solid and phlegmatic is an English bulldog of the old school while Clough is more like a rooster crowing and strutting in pursuit of his own celebrity.

But Mr. Sheen�۪s performance is persuasive and illuminating not only of the man�۪s doubts and aspirations but also as if from within of his world." and the film is wise not to blow these up into tragic flaws. He is not Prince Hal or Coriolanus but rather a creature of the modern media-saturated world. ���The Damned United�۝ shares with ���The Queen�۝ and ���Frost/Nixon�۝ not only a writer and a star but also a precise and satisfying sense of proportion." Mr. Sheen plays a fast-moving clever insecure man whose momentum is stalled by a stubborn somewhat enigmatic older figure. Don Revie is for Brian Clough what Richard Nixon is to David Frost and Queen Elizabeth is to Tony Blair: a nemesis a symbol the possessor of an elusive and archaic almost magical kind of power. As the confrontation between these magi and their would-be acolytes (or usurpers) unfolds an entire social order snaps into focus." tired and polarized Britain split between old ways and new between North and South between Labor and Tory.

Noticing that she is lugging her cello David chats with her about the British composer Edward Elgar and before she knows it he is squiring her to art auctions and concerts plying her with Champagne and cigarettes and airy high-minded talk." but the director Lone Scherfig and the screenwriter Nick Hornby let it float gradually and gently to the ground. It is vital to the movie�۪s delicate comic tone that intimations of the predatory duplicitous aspects of David�۪s character do not emerge too suddenly. Jenny is smitten and so rather astonishingly are her parents in particular her conservative and unworldly father who all but delivers his daughter to her seducer tied up in a bow believing that this is an opportunity for her social advancement." too needs to be fooled for a while and Mr. Sarsgaard handles a tricky role with sly aplomb allowing doubt and then revulsion to mix drop by drop into our impression of him. David and his fabulous friends Danny and Helen (Dominic Cooper and Rosamund Pike) turn out not to be the high-living swells Jenny takes them for but something rather more tawdry. And yet even as she begins to see through them and David in particular Jenny plays along with their charade as if determined to follow her experiment to its conclusion." which becomes the talk of her school attracting the concern of a sad kindly young teacher (Olivia Williams) and the fierce disapproval of the headmistress (Emma Thompson taking a practice run at her inevitable portrayal of Margaret Thatcher)." with what she imagines to be full knowledge of the consequences seeking out what the vestigial Victorianism of her era would see as her ruin." �۝ which catches Britain around the time when as Philip Larkin put it in his famous poem ���sexual intercourse began.�۝ There is a bit of that stuff in ���An Education �۝ but it�۪s more the symbol of other kinds of experience than the reverse.

Even as David is taking advantage of her innocence she is at first unwittingly and then more brazenly using him to find her way to that world which she identifies especially with France." and Ms. Scherfig and Mr. Hornby make some effort to reckon the costs of her exploration as well as the thrills. Tears do flow after the Champagne is all drunk. But the filmmakers themselves seem too intoxicated by the mystique of the period to take full account of the sad bleak aspects of the story they have to tell. At crucial moments the movie recoils from its own implications and finds a default tone of wry comedy when something more stringent and difficult is called for." it is hard to resist like David himself. Some of this allure arises from the appeal of a moment in the past that seems in ���Mad Men�۝ and beyond to be enjoying some cultural cachet. And Ms. Scherfig a Danish filmmaker whose previous work includes  ���Italian for Beginners �۝ the only comedy the Dogme 95 movement has ever produced and the morbidly charming ���Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself �۝ catches some of the headlong energy of the British and French New Waves that were part of Jenny�۪s world." ���An Education �۝ perhaps inevitably drifts toward nostalgia.

�۝ a new documentary directed by Kristopher Belman invites comparisons with ���Hoop Dreams �۝ Steve James�۪s 1994 film about the lives of two young Chicago basketball players. That movie was an almost miraculous fusion of filmmaking art and real-life narrative full of twists and reversals. ���More Than a Game �۝ which looks back on the achievements of a high school basketball team in Akron Ohio that happened to include the future N.B.A. superstar LeBron James is halfway there. The art is lacking but the material is remarkable enough to make up for pedestrian filmmaking." at first glance familiar: a group of players of varying ability a coach who seems an unlikely candidate to lead them various breakthroughs and setbacks on the way to the big game. The coach is Dru Joyce II a former businessman whose interest in basketball came about because his son Dru III in spite of his small size was crazy about the game. The elder Joyce coached a youth league team that included Sian Cotton Willie McGee James and his son four friends who went on to become the nucleus of the Fighting Irish of St. Vincent-St. Mary High School." Joyce took over and led the Irish to state and national prominence. The tale of this journey conveyed like the rest of ���More Than a Game�۝ through old video footage and recent interviews is heartening but sometimes less than riveting. There is some interesting insight into the friendships among the players the tensions between the coach and his son and the uneasy assimilation of a fifth player Romeo Travis into the close-knit nucleus of the team. But it�۪s mostly a whole bunch of games many of them shot in low-grade home video." you catch glimpses of themes that might have been explored more thoroughly as well as of some pretty good basketball. I found myself wanting to go further into Akron and its African-American neighborhoods and to spend more time with the players and their families. Still there is enough personality and local flavor to create a context for the drama that takes shape in the film�۪s second half." while he was still a junior at St. Vincent-St. Mary James was the subject of a Sports Illustrated cover story and his sudden celebrity takes ���More Than a Game�۝ to a place that ���Hoop Dreams�۝ only dreamed of. Suddenly the modest celebration of a talented group of kids becomes something else: a half-critical half-starry-eyed exploration of the money-mad fame-besotted frenzy that is big-time sports in America. The value of the movie is that it keeps track of the impact that James�۪s rise had on his friends his family and his team and reminds the audience that the superstars who so often seem otherworldly and unreal started out as ordinary kids." an executive producer of the film talk about the poverty and displacement he experienced as a child and about his attachment to his mother who was a teenager when he was born. And a lot of the archival video is pretty amazing. Mr. Belman though is too enamored of easy emotional payoffs cued by swelling music and manipulative editing almost as if he did not quite trust the power of his story. And the story might have been richer in its characters and themes if its inspirational aspects were not pushed so hard.

With ���The Invention of Lying �۝ a mostly funny if melancholic defense of deceit Mr. Gervais has come up with the makings of a classic. Alas making is not doing. And while the movie is a conceptual pip filled with quotable laughs and gentle pokes at religious faith at its most literal it also looks so shoddy that you yearn for the camerawork lighting and polish of his shows like the original ���The Office �۝ because really these days TV rarely looks this bad." I�۪m just being honest in keeping with the movie�۪s comic premise. Mr. Gervais stars as Mark Bellison a sad sack and screenwriter who lives in a world that looks a lot like our own only sleepier less shiny and with no visible security cameras. The defining characteristic of this somewhat bland storybook land with its calm streets and token homeless man is that no one ever tells an untruth not lovers or friends bosses or assistants moviemakers or advertisers. While that makes for some awkward moments it also makes for some initially fine comedy. The tagline for Coke here is simple elegant true: ���It�۪s very famous.�۝ While an ad for Pepsi just concedes the obvious: ���When they don�۪t have Coke.�۝" whose rounded sagging shoulders suggest that he�۪s never recovered from his schoolyard torments honesty breeds contempt but mostly humiliation. When he goes on a first date with a beauty Anna (Jennifer Garner) she opens the door and announces ���I was  just  masturbating.�۝ To which he replies ���That makes me think of your vagina.�۝ This in turn makes her run upstairs and finish what she started. And so it embarrassingly amusingly goes as the mismatched couple both honest to an excruciating and painful fault dine at a restaurant where the hostess blurts out that she�۪s threatened by Anna and a waiter begins service with the matter-of-fact announcement that Anna is out of Mark�۪s league." but because the moviemakers want to have their fun and their Hollywood ending both much of the story involves getting these two together. That�۪s generically diverting but the better smarter more ticklish stuff in the movie involves the simple truth that a world without lying is also one without art. Over at Lecture Films where Mark struggles as a writer the movies are based only on true events like the black plague. Narrated by stuffed shirts (Christopher Guest in whiskers) seated  in armchairs and pompously droning into the camera this is cinema without fictional embellishment heaving bosoms rustling crinolines passion pleasure or intrigue kind of like ���Masterpiece Theater�۝ without Evelyn Waugh or the Bront��s." for whom lying (���the telling of beautiful untrue things�۝) was ���the proper aim of art.�۝ That�۪s an intoxicating rich idea that Mr. Gervais who wrote and directed the movie with an American newcomer Matthew Robinson exploits minimally. (This is the first movie directing gig for both men.) That�۪s too bad because some of the sweetest moments are of Mark lying or rather exercising his imagination as when he tenderly tells a dying woman that there�۪s more than the  void on the other side. Or when he summarizes the first fictional script which features ninjas and aliens and sounds like something Roger Corman cooked up in the 1950s. In these scenes lying becomes a means to transcendence an escape from the quotidian from our oppressive literal-mindedness from our brute selves." though Mr. Gervais prefers to shock us with our own brutality. Some of these jolts are delivered through dialogue exchanged by performers  ���  among the appealing guest stars are Jason Bateman Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jeffrey Tambor  ���  blurting the awful truth while stranded inside the inert ugly setups. At other times  the bad news arrives on a sign like that on a nursing home that reads ���A Sad Place for Hopeless Old People.�۝ You wince you laugh you wince again. At some point though these unvarnished truths begin to feel heavy cruel. The truth doesn�۪t just hurt  ���  sometimes it�۪s also degrading and not just for the characters. The movie encourages our inner bully coaxing it out for giggles." I suppose: the filmmakers want the audience to feel the sting of these blunt verdicts largely it seems so that Mr. Gervais can later tut-tut us about how mean and wrong we�۪ve been. In ���Extras �۝ his hilarious television series about life on the show business margins Mr. Gervais played a professional narcissist (an actor) who after a long  slog hits the B-ish list only to then wag his finger at everyone (us included) for being so obsessed with fame. He�۪s following a similar strategy here by playing the nominal loser turned triumphant conscience and while that�۪s fine as far it goes the movie itself would have gone further if he and Mr. Robinson had worked harder on their own sweet lies  ���  their art." booze insults."

I  and everyone who has ever watched him shamble into action megaphone to mouth know from the start. He might have had a crush on capitalism early on yet anyone who thinks that the two have been on friendly terms for a while hasn�۪t been paying attention. After years of needling big business in movies like ���Roger & Me�۝ (about the auto industry) and ���Sicko�۝ (health insurance) and giving voice to the disempowered he has finally decided to go after the system that in his words is dedicated to ���taking and giving mostly taking.�۝" as the headlines and innumerable journalists politicians bloggers tea partiers talk-show bloviators and millions of unemployed underemployed fed-up and freaked-out citizens are making clear. It�۪s the morning after in America (where one of the big movie hits of the year is titled ���The Hangover�۝) and Captain Mike is here to explain it all or at least crack jokes milk tears recycle the news and fan the flames of liberal indignation. Along the way because his heart is in the right place even if his images aren�۪t always he also makes room for other voices including those of striking workers and members of one family in foreclosure who videotaped the police breaking down the door to evict them." Mr. Moore cuts right to the point or rather the queasy joke opening the movie with surveillance shots of citizens partaking of a favorite pastime: robbing banks. He then introduces some wittily culled clips from a movie titled ���Life in Ancient Rome �۝ which looks and sounds like one of those educational flicks you tried to sleep through in school  and which he juxtaposes with more recent totems of American power including the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center draped in the Stars and Stripes. (The New York premiere of the movie on Monday was at Alice Tully Hall the main site for the New York Film Festival. Mr. Moore isn�۪t in this year�۪s lineup but still grabbed some of its spotlight.)" in other words is headed straight down the historical toilet along with Nero and his fiddle (or rather Dick Cheney who�۪s anointed with a throwaway reference to the ���emperor�۝) a thesis that Mr. Moore continues to advance if not refine with another hour and a half or so of alternatingly entertaining and distracting found footage; some stirring archival images of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; snippets from charming home movies; and assorted weeping gloating pontificating and sensible talking heads. Some of those heads are baffling (the actor and author Wallace Shawn enlisted to explain free enterprise); some of them are sharp welcome bracing provoking mostly when they�۪re able to talk without too much interference from the comically mugging slack-jawed Mr. Moore." the story in ���Capitalism�۝ more truly begins where and when its director did in Flint Mich. after the end of World War II. In broad strokes Mr. Moore who was born in 1954 positions himself as an Everyman whose family reaped all the usual rewards of postwar middle-class prosperity. This collective dream begins to disintegrate rather fuzzily (cue the Vietnam War) coming to a bummer climax in the 1970s (cue an unsmiling Jimmy Carter in a cardigan) and culminating in the ascension of the Smiler in Chief Ronald Reagan whom Mr. Moore introduces as a ���spokesmodel for president.�۝ Tax cuts union busting and household debt ensue as does some protest notably in the form of ���Roger & Me �۝ Mr. Moore�۪s first movie." �۝ which involved his attempts to speak with Roger Smith the chief executive of the floundering General Motors; he also includes some nominal highlights from that 1989 movie. A lot of performers like to replay their early hits so it isn�۪t surprising that Mr. Moore a practiced showman recycles images of his younger slimmer self engaging in one of his trademark moves: trying to enter a building to speak truth to power only to be turned away by security guards. It was faintly amusing theater then especially if you didn�۪t think too hard about the fact that he was hassling working people just trying to do their jobs. It�۪s less amusing when he repeats the same routine in ���Capitalism.�۝" journalistic interviews with people who have been abused by the greed of their employers. In one segment he visits with a widower whose wife was unknowingly insured by her company ��� a sleazy practice colloquially known as dead peasant insurance ��� which earned it a chunk of change when the woman died. (Even after death your boss can exploit you.) Like many of the stories Mr. Moore pulls together in this movie dead peasant insurance might not be a revelation to those who follow the news but it makes for infuriating viewing." what is to be done? After watching ���Capitalism �۝ it beats me. Mr. Moore doesn�۪t have any real answers either which tends to be true of most socially minded directors in the commercial mainstream and speaks more to the limits of such filmmaking than to anything else. Like most of his movies ���Capitalism�۝ is a tragedy disguised as a comedy; it�۪s also an entertainment. This isn�۪t the story of capitalism as conceived by Karl Marx or Naomi Klein and it certainly isn�۪t the story of contemporary American capitalism which extends across the globe and far beyond Mr. Moore�۪s sightlines." which suggests a startling faith in the possibilities of social change in the current political system. That faith appears to be due in some part to the election of President Obama." the most galvanizing words in the movie come not from the current president but from Roosevelt who in 1944 called for a ���second bill of rights �۝ asserting that ���true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.�۝  The image of this visibly frail president who died the next year appealing to our collective conscience ��� and mapping out an American future that remains elusive ��� is moving beyond words. And chilling: ���People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.�۝  It�۪s a brilliant moment of cinema both for the man delivering the speech and for Mr. Moore who smartly realized that he�۪d found one other voice that needed to be as loud as his own."

A real-life whodunit and why it recounts the strange tale of Mark Whitacre a biochemist and executive who starting in the early 1990s supplied the Federal Bureau of Investigation with hundreds of tapes that implicated his firm Archer Daniels Midland in a global price-fixing scheme. Known as the supermarket to the world A.D.M.  manufactures among many other products the kinds of ingredients that invariably show up in tiny print on the labels of almost everything we eat mystery matter like lecithin sorbitol and xanthan gum. It also produces lysine an amino acid given to feedlot cattle and other livestock." or rather its very costly mistake though that�۪s getting ahead of the secrets and lies of this movie which opens with Mark (Matt Damon) waxing philosophical about corn. Over a series of elegant uncluttered precisely framed softly lighted images that are representative of the movie�۪s visual design he expounds on the remarkable diversity of corn the wonder starch. It�۪s amazing stuff all righty he explains in his characteristic intimate voice-over the words rushing and gushing unwinding in unbroken if sometimes tangled threads. You then see him talking up corn to one of his sons first over a meal and then in a red Porsche zipping down the road an image Mr. Soderbergh briefly flips upside down." while it might be mistaken for a filmmaker�۪s fillip introduces the topsy-turvy world Mark enters as soon as he steps into the office where he strides through the sterile headquarters accompanied by his own jaunty theme music. Gently plumped with a mouth-breather�۪s slack smile he looks like an overgrown baby and is if a generously paid one. A biochemist and the company�۪s youngest vice president he earns a salary hefty enough to stuff a garage with sports cars and cram a large house with all the ugly knickknacks and furniture money can buy. He�۪s living high on the hog making supplements for hogs. When he stands on his manicured lawn seemingly deep in thought he looks every overfed inch like the American dream." cynical movie about how we buy now ��� oops I mean how we live now. Money makes the world go �۪round in ���The Informant! �۝ much as it does everywhere and much as it most certainly does in his previous movie ���The Girlfriend Experience �۝ about a young prostitute selling her waxed wares. This time though Mr. Soderbergh has trained his focus and expertly wielded digital camera on the other side of the buy-and-sell equation on the men in suits who fly in corporate planes nursing drinks while they chortle about the breasts of their female employees. These are masters of our universe the big little men who control and distort world markets." a masterwork of narrative compression that the screenwriter Scott Z. Burns distilled from the book�۪s some 600 detailed pages. (Mr. Eichenwald covered the story for The New York Times.) You�۪ll never miss a thing. Like Mr. Soderbergh Mr. Burns (���The Bourne Ultimatum�۝) doesn�۪t appear to have much use for narrative fat. And so they rapidly move Mark into position and just as quickly bring in the F.B.I. agents Shephard (Scott Bakula) and Herndon (Joel McHale) who after wiring up Mark�۪s body and briefcase become so touchingly protective of him that they carry around a photo of his family." a grudging metamorphosis that parallels your own. Mr. Damon�۪s inherent likeability makes him something of a Trojan horse here not only because he�۪s a star (and therefore beloved by definition) but also because he�۪s so boyish no matter the part. That�۪s true even in ���The Informant! �۝ though he�۪s been gleefully uglied up for the role with a fake bulbous nose and real pudge. Mr. Damon�۪s physical choices tell you a lot about the character long before the truth seeps out. As does Mark�۪s tendency to drift into banalities in the voice-over ��� he natters on about ties polar bears and butterflies while the scandal unfolds ��� a brilliant screenwriting device that hints at an inner duality." though he and even A.D.M. were really symptoms of a greater disease ��� greed corruption name your capitalist vice ��� that was eating away at the country until it popped bubbles forced millions out of work and plunged the United States into the economic abyss. In films like ���Erin Brockovich�۝ and ���Traffic�۝ Mr. Soderbergh has so successfully sexed up the social-issue picture casting stars as crusading cops and bodacious do-gooders that it�۪s been easy to diminish or simply ignore the passion of his commitment.

In this movie it rages." anger fuels ���The Informant! �۝ giving it its pulse and reason for being. Anger inspires its giggles forces its tears and might even explain the fiery orange that colors so many faces as if this world and its people were on the verge of immolation. Like all of Mr. Soderbergh�۪s movies this one can be appreciated on purely formal terms for the clarity of its images and the economy of the storytelling. But it is Mr. Soderbergh�۪s insistence on seeing the A.D.M. scandal as a collective tragedy rather than as another white-collar crime that gives the movie force resonance feeling.

�۝ a bloody high school demonic-possession serial-killer comedy written by Diablo Cody directed by Karyn Kusama and starring Megan Fox in the title role is an unholy mess." the movie�۪s gory set pieces are executed with more carnivorous glee than formal discipline and its story is as full of holes as some of its disemboweled victims. But coherence has never been a significant criterion for horror movies. If it were we could forget about Dario Argento and Brian De Palma half of Hitchcock and most of the entries in the ���Friday the 13th�۝ series. And though it is too soon to install ���Jennifer�۪s Body�۝ in that blood-soaked pantheon the movie deserves ��� and is likely to win ��� a devoted cult following despite its flaws." panicky fascination with female sexuality that we all know and sublimate ��� and turn it inside out. This is not a simple reversal of perspective; the girl�۪s point of view has frequently been explored in both maniac-on-the-loose thrillers and homeroom-to-prom-night romantic comedies. ���Jennifer�۪s Body�۝ goes further taking the complication and confusion of being a young woman as its central problem and operating principle the soil from which it harvests a tangle of unruly metaphors mixed emotions crazy jokes and ambivalent insights." chilly dark-haired and beautiful is both the victim of male violence and a monster of indiscriminate vengeance a ravening demon and an object of lust and longing. But always an object. The title of the movie is not ���Jennifer�۪s Soul �۝ and from every angle she is a fantasy a cipher a figure in someone else�۪s fevered imagination. The inevitable critical sneering at Ms. Fox�۪s acting abilities will miss exactly this point. Her blunt blank affect belongs to the character not the performer and is part of the film�۪s calculated tease. Ms. Kusama puts Ms. Fox�۪s lithe physique right in your face and then demands to know what you think you�۪re looking at." bile-spewing succubus Jennifer is the embodiment of a series of high school clich̩s that almost entirely obscure her inner life. She�۪s a mean girl a bad girl a popular girl a dream girl ��� the one every other girl envies and every boy wants. But she is not the heroine of the movie and it is not her predicament that makes it so interesting and original." short for Anita. Played by Amanda Seyfried she is Jennifer�۪s best friend and if Ms. Fox brazenly incarnates teenage girl clich̩s Ms. Seyfried slyly subverts them. Needy is sensible studious and bespectacled but hardly a nerd. She has a good-natured boyfriend named Chip (Johnny Simmons) and she seems generally well adjusted: curious about sex but not obsessed with it adventurous but not reckless prudent but not timid. She is also tough kind and funny." who lures one young man after another to his doom. The jock the goth and others are so bedazzled by her attention that they are blind to her murderous intentions. She has been similarly fooled and abused but ���Jennifer�۪s Body�۝ is not only a fantasy of revenge against the predatory male sex though the ultimate enactment of that revenge is awfully satisfying. The antagonism and attraction between boys and girls is a relatively straightforward (if in this case grisly) matter; the real terror the stuff of Needy�۪s nightmares lies in the snares and shadows of female friendship." sisterly undermining sadomasochistic treacherous and tender. ���Hell �۝ Needy asserts early on ���is a teenage girl.�۝ If Jean-Paul Sartre were in the databank of allusions Ms. Cody has supplied her with she might have specified that hell is other teenage girls. The inferno consumes everything around it very nearly including the movie itself." provincial-hipster babble that is for Ms. Cody what terse Chicago indirection is for David Mamet and long-winded analysis of cultural trivia is for Quentin Tarantino." though at other times she is happy to utter all manner of blasphemy. ���Move on dot org �۝ Jennifer says perhaps attempting to top an already legendary nonsensical non sequitur from Ms. Cody�۪s ���Juno�۝ screenplay: ���Honest to blog.�۝" though ���Juno �۝ mannered and self-conscious as it was gave us in the person of Ellen Page a young heroine with a sharp tongue a good heart and questionable judgment ��� a character who was smart surprising and in the end hard to resist.

Sometimes birds take wing and soar through the sky though they can also be killed by slingshot and roasted on a makeshift grill. There are physical scars that characters display (or inflict on themselves) to make manifest the pain within." chronologically fractured story of loss guilt betrayal and general moroseness. Actually the assignment has already been completed in the form of Guillermo Arriaga�۪s screenplay.

She and her classmates debate about colonialism resistance and relations between the industrialized world and ���the global South �۝ dropping names like Frantz Fanon and Joseph Stiglitz as they try to make sense of a world that is both distant and immediate." �۝ a quiet and lovely new film by the French director Claire Denis is partly concerned with measuring that distance the bewildering chasm between huge and tumultuous international movements and individual lives. It is self-evident that the story of Jos̩phine and Lionel an African immigrant whose wife was German is bound up in a complicated history of demographics and political economy. The fact that nearly all of the characters in this film are French while  few are white is a further index of how the European landscape has changed in recent decades." the one that shapes Ms. Denis�۪s delicate narrative is the one that occurs  within Lionel and Jos̩phine�۪s relationship. It has to do with universally recognizable but nonetheless highly particular shifts in emotional weather as a child and her parent undertake a gradual separation after years of solitary intimacy." particularly in Africa. In films like ���Chocolat�۝ (her 1988 debut not to be confused with the more recent Juliette Binoche-Johnny Depp confection) and ���Beau Travail�۝ (1999) she has examined some of the political contradictions and psychological pressures of this colonial legacy but in ���35 Shots of Rum�۝ it remains in the background like those classroom discussions.

�۝ which tells the tale of Keats and Fanny Brawne the love of his short life is a romantic movie. The vernacular of popular culture and the somewhat specialized language of literary history assign different meanings to that word but the achievement of Jane Campion�۪s learned and ravishing new film is to fuse them to trace the comminglings  and collisions of poetic creation and amatory passion." not least because a bog of clich̩ and fallacy lies between the filmmaker and her goal. In the first decades of the 19th century some poets may have been like movie stars but the lives of the poets have been in general badly served on film either neglected altogether or puffed up with sentiment and solemnity. The Regency period moreover serves too many lazy prestige-minded directors as a convenient vintage clothing store. And there are times in ���Bright Star�۝ when Keats played by the pale and skinny British actor Ben Whishaw (���Perfume �۝ ���I�۪m Not There�۝) trembles on the edge of caricature. He broods; he coughs (signaling the tuberculosis that will soon kill him); he looks dreamily at flowers and trees and rocks." rather than feeling studied or obvious arrive with startling keenness and disarming beauty much in the way that Keats�۪s own lyrics do. His verses can at first seem ornate and sentimental but on repeated readings they have a way of gaining in force and freshness. The music is so intricate and artificial even as the emotions it carries seem natural and spontaneous. And while no film can hope to take you inside the process by which these poems were made Ms. Campion allows you to hear them spoken aloud as if for the first time. You will want to stay until the very last bit of the end credits not necessarily to read the name of each gaffer and grip but rather to savor every syllable of Mr. Whishaw�۪s recitation of ���Ode to a Nightingale.�۝" championed by a loyal coterie of literary friends ��� is the fixed point around which ���Bright Star�۝ orbits. Its animating force however is the infatuation that envelops Keats and Brawne in their early meetings and grows over the subsequent months into a sustaining and tormenting love. Mr. Keats as his lover decorously calls him is diffident and uneasy at times but also witty sly and steadfast. The movie really belongs to Brawne played with mesmerizing vitality and heart-stopping grace by Abbie Cornish." an Australian actress whose previous films include ���Stop-Loss �۝ ���Candy�۝ and ���Somersault �۝ has at  27 achieved a mixture of unguardedness and self-control matched by few actresses of any age or nationality. She�۪s as good as Kate Winslet which is about as good as it�۪s possible to be." the eldest daughter of a distracted widow (Kerry Fox) has some of the spirited cleverness of a Jane Austen heroine. A gifted seamstress she prides herself on her forward-looking fashion sense and her independence. She is also vain insecure and capable of throwing herself headlong into the apparent folly of adoring a dying and penniless poet something no sensible Austen character would ever do." ���Bright Star�۝ might collapse in swooning and sighing or into the static rhythms of a love poem. And while there are passages of extraordinary lyricism ��� butterflies fields of flowers fluttering hands and beseeching glances ��� these are balanced by a rough energetic worldliness. Lovers like poets may create their own realms of feeling and significance but they do so in contention with the same reality that the rest of us inhabit." Keats�۪s friend patron and collaborator and his main rival for Fanny�۪s attention. For Brown Fanny is an irritant and a distraction though the sarcastic intensity of their banter carries an interesting sexual charge of its own. In an Austen novel this friction would be resolved in matrimony but ���Bright Star �۝ following the crooked shadowed path of biographical fact has a different story to tell." when the story begins. In April of the following year the poets are occupying one-half of a house with Fanny and her mother and siblings on the other side of the wall. After nine months Keats in declining health is dispatched to Italy by a committee of concerned friends but until then  he and Fanny consummate their love in every possible way except physically." illuminating Sigmund Freud�۪s ���dark continent�۝ with skepticism sympathy and occasional indignation. ���Bright Star�۝ could easily have become a dark simple fable of repression since modern audiences like nothing better than to be assured that our social order is freer and more enlightened than any that came before. But Fanny and Keats are modern too and though the mores of their time constrain them they nonetheless regard themselves as free." but Brown blithely crosses class lines to have some fun with (and impregnate) a na��ve and illiterate young household servant (Antonia Campbell-Hughes). That Fanny and Keats must sublimate their longings in letters poems and conversations seems cruel but they make the best of it. As does Ms. Campion: a sequence in which fully clothed the couple trades stanzas of ���La Belle Dame Sans Merci�۝ in a half-darkened bedroom must surely count as one of the hottest sex scenes in recent cinema." with her restless camera movements and off-center close-ups films history in the present tense and her wild vitality makes this movie romantic in every possible sense of the word."

author of a blog and book of the same name. The title of this multifarious multimedia project is if not exactly disingenuous at least somewhat double edged. For a year Mr. Beavan and his family turned their small Manhattan apartment into the site of an experiment in radical nonconsumption. They forewent many of the conveniences of modern life ��� from coffee to electricity to toilet paper ��� in order to minimize their use direct and indirect of carbon-based fuels. But even as he and his wife Michelle Conlin organized their daily routines to have the least possible environmental impact Mr. Beavan a freelance writer was working to maximize the cultural and ideological impact of his enterprise." in the course of ordinary life count as modest or private undertakings acquire a special significance when they become the basis of book proposals. A. J. Jacobs followed numerous  biblical commandments  (there are a lot more than 10); Morgan Spurlock ate nothing but fast food; Julie Powell cooked her way through Julia Child�۪s ���Mastering the Art of French Cooking.�۝ And Mr. Beavan in a similarly self-displaying if more austere spirit weaned himself Ms. Conlin and their young daughter from motorized transportation nonlocal food and light bulbs." as stated in the film and on his blog were indisputably virtuous. By pushing himself further than even the most conscientious recyclers and locavores are usually willing to go Mr. Beavan hoped to raise awareness both about the ecological costs of overconsumption and about possible solutions to the problem. These goals are conveniently as impossible to measure as they are to criticize. They also rest on an unexamined investment in the culture of celebrity and publicity which while perhaps less globally destructive than carbon-burning consumerism can have a corrosive effect on individual dignity and collective morality. The main purpose of the year of no impact was to justify and to raise awareness of the project itself." ���No Impact Man �۝ directed by Laura Gabbert and Justin Schein is of little interest and less utility. It provides no new scientific insights or political arguments and celebrates various behavioral changes without assessing their value or importance. Mr. Beavan�۪s evangelical self-congratulatory demeanor has the effect especially early in the film of playing to the unfortunate perception that what drives many environmentalists is above all the need to feel superior to their neighbors and fellow citizens." �۝ however is not really an eco-documentary. There are plenty of those. But there are not many films that so unsparingly (if also perhaps inadvertently) expose the confused power dynamics of a certain kind of modern middle-class marriage. Whatever else he is doing Mr. Beavan is by laying down a new and draconian set of household laws dramatically asserting his own authority in the domestic sphere. A thoroughly modern dad who does most of the cooking and dishwashing and whose wife goes off each day to work in the offices of BusinessWeek he is a paragon of sensitive patriarchy." the blog  and the book (and now the movie) are called ���No Impact Man �۝ not ���No Impact Family.�۝  But this doesn�۪t mean that she�۪s exempt only that he�۪s in charge. When she asks for permission to drink coffee to help her through a work deadline Mr. Beavan scolds and pouts and guilt-trips her for breaking protocol all the while claiming that he doesn�۪t really care if she does or not. But even after the lights have gone out and the refrigerator has been replaced by a giant flowerpot lined with sand enough electrical power is found to keep Mr. Beavan�۪s laptop going. He has a blog (noimpactman.typepad.com) to write after all." when Ms. Conlin wants to discuss the possibility of having a second child ��� a sibling for their adorable 2-year-old daughter Isabella ��� Mr. Beavan complains that having such a conversation on camera is too much like reality television. Further he says he can see no connection or parallel between his investment in the no-impact project and her desire for more kids." whose side the film at first seems implicitly to take in a simmering marital battle. Mr. Beavan comes across as a passive-aggressive zealot and when  ��� in the wake of an article in The  New York Times  about the family ���  his wife receives messages from strangers urging her to dump him it�۪s hard not to see their point. Not that she is entirely admirable. Needy and indecisive she seems like the weaker less imaginative member  of the couple." just as you start to think you can�۪t stand another minute(much less six more months) with these people the film executes a quietly surprising turn. Mr. Beavan starts to seem more humble and less domineering and Ms. Conlin turns from whiny camp follower into skeptical good sport. The family bikes around the city and cooks organic food by candlelight and the no-impact regimen mutates from family issue to family adventure." in the end an elaborate stunt. But as a professional writer a New York husband and a man with a compost bin an organic-produce fetish and a guilty conscience I can�۪t in the end (all appearances to the contrary) judge Mr. Beavan or this film too severely. Making an impact is easy. Making a difference is hard." and the Discoveries He Makes About Himself and Our Way of Life in the Process�۝ by Colin Beavan; director of photography Mr. Schein; edited by William Haugse and Matthew Martin; music by Bobby Johnston; produced by Ms. Gabbert and Eden Wurmfeld; released by Oscilloscope Laboratories.

Joe Berlinger�۪s ���Crude �۝ a thorough and impassioned new documentary focuses its gaze on production rather than consumption. The film which follows the fitful progress of a class-action lawsuit undertaken on behalf of the people  of the Ecuadorean Amazon is not about the unintended consequences of using petroleum.  Instead it examines the terrible frequently unacknowledged costs of extracting oil from the ground." �۝ in other words investigates the local manifestations �� cancer contaminated water cultural degradation �� of a global problem.

And so the lawyers and activists who oppose these conglomerates have tried to  become equally mobile and adaptable moving continually in the zigzagging paths traced by transnational capitalism." relatively small slice of territory (about the size of Rhode Island) its action shifts from muddy villages in Amazonia to law offices and shareholders�۪ meetings in the steel-and-glass cities of North America drawing into its purview a motley cast of scientists human rights crusaders civil servants and international celebrities." ���Crude�۝ does not pretend to neutrality. Yet while  Mr. Berlinger�۪s sympathies clearly lie with the oddly matched pair of lawyers �� Steven Donziger a big outgoing American and Pablo Fajardo a wiry diffident Ecuadorean �� who are consumed by the now 16-year-old suit against Chevron he is fair-minded enough to include rebuttals from the company�۪s executives and in-house environmental scientists." in part a courtroom drama both sides have a chance to be heard. The Ecuadorean practice of conducting parts of the trial in the field generates some oddly theatrical moments as lawyers deliver florid impromptu speeches al fresco in front of huts or at the edges of waste sites." a good heart and a digital video camera are all that is required for an effective documentary. Luckily Mr. Berlinger has both a strong narrative instinct and a keen eye for incongruous evocative and powerful images. His previous work includes the thoughtful true-crime stories ���Brother�۪s Keeper�۝ and ���Paradise Lost�۝ and also the superb heavy-metal psychodrama ���Metallica: Some Kind of Monster.�۝ What these films have in common with one another and with ���Crude �۝ which Mr. Berlinger worked on for three years is a strong sense of character and an openness to the unexpected." it does so with a welcome sense of human foible and contradiction. Mr. Fajardo who worked in the oil fields as a young man blames Chevron (current owner of Texaco which opened up his home region to drilling) for many of the ills that have befallen his family and his people. In the course of ���Crude�۝ he becomes something of a star in the Western news and entertainment media profiled in Vanity Fair showered with awards and posing for pictures with Sting after a benefit concert." Chevron�۪s Ecuadorean lawyers portray the suit as a money-making scheme bankrolled by a Manhattan law firm and base their defense simultaneously on appealing  to national pride and   blaming  the state-run petroleum company which took over from Texaco in the early 1990s. The case takes an interesting swerve when Rafael Correa a young economist with populist tendencies is elected Ecuador�۪s president and publicly supports the plaintiffs�۪ position." since the legal struggle �� and the public relations war between big companies and those who feel preyed upon by them �� is unlikely to end soon. Behind that conflict lies a long and complicated history and ahead of us lie many more documentaries similar in tone and spirit to this one. We can hope that at least a few of them are as intelligently and artfully made."

While the arrivals in the other two movies were not legal immigrants" the indomitably good-natured protagonist of ���Amreeka �۝ which is set in 2003 at the outset of the American-led invasion of Iraq is inspired by the experiences of Ms. Dabis a Palestinian-Jordanian who grew up in Ohio and in Jordan and whose parents immigrated to the United States just before she was born. During the Persian Gulf war she recalls in the production notes her family faced the same kinds of persecution and ostracism that Muna and her sister�۪s family the Halabys suffer  as the invasion continues." in coming to America she is forsaking a relatively comfortable existence  to venture into the unknown with her 16-year-old son Fadi (Melkar Muallem)." where they are detained for three hours mother and son endure the same sort of hostile interrogation they received at West Bank checkpoints. After finally passing through immigration they are met by Muna�۪s severe sister Raghda Halaby (Hiam Abbass) and her family who live in a semi-rural suburb." who left  the West Bank 15 years earlier but is still profoundly homesick is married to a successful Palestinian doctor Nabeel (Yussef Abu Warda).

Deeply ashamed she is too proud to tell her sister." ���Amreeka�۝ maintains the buoyant mood of a serious sitcom. As Muna and Fadi confront hostility and prejudice their misadventures some of which augur disaster are resolved without too much grief. The movie is peppered with little jokes. Scrutinizing the cover of a supermarket tabloid Muna asks ���What does adopting an orangutan love child mean?�۝ A roadside sign with missing letters advises ���Support our oops.�۝" who as embodied by Ms. Faour is the kind of warm lovable woman you want to hug. Desperate for work and unable to find it at a local bank Muna takes a job at a White Castle next door but pretends to her family that the bank is her workplace." Fadi encounters ethnic slurs and bullying and in the most serious incident is arrested after retaliating. At the same time rising anti-Arab sentiment decimates Nabeel�۪s medical practice and strains the Halabys�۪ marriage. As his practice evaporates Ms. Abbass the great Palestinian actress who also appeared in ���The Visitor �۝ imbues Raghda with a heavy weight of sorrow and anxiety." Muna perseveres. For every hostile person she encounters there is a good Samaritan. Her co-workers at White Castle are understanding when she makes mistakes. Her most helpful ally is Mr. Novatski (Joseph Ziegler) the divorced Polish-Jewish principal at Fadi�۪s school who comes to his rescue at a crucial turning point." at moments the film�۪s positive outlook verges on na��vet̩ it never strays over separating the possible from the preposterous. ���Amreeka�۝ believes in people and its faith rubs off on you."

but the grimly unfunny comedy ���All About Steve�۝ might just be the worst movie on Sandra Bullock�۪s r̩sum̩. What makes this insult (to her to us) even worse is that her production company backed the project. This means that unlike movie stars of the classical studio system who were contractually obliged by their bosses to sometimes play insulting trivializing roles Ms. Bullock or more likely her representatives actually tapped people to make her look this bad. She�۪s the mistress of her own misfortune." an unfortunate hairdo serves as an early indicator of the ensuing trouble. (See also Elizabeth Taylor in ���Cleopatra�۝ and Colin Farrell in ���Alexander.�۝) Wearing a honeyed shag that�۪s probably meant to evoke Jane Fonda in ���Klute�۝ but looks like a repurposed mullet Ms. Bullock enters grinning and squinting and twitching in a pantomime of frenetic adorableness. When the movie opens her character Mary Horowitz a crossword puzzle creator is living with her parents while her home is being fumigated. Given her social ineptitude and overworked wackiness ��� her logorrhea ubiquitous red boots and a pet rodent that appears to be her only friend ��� it�۪s a surprise she ever left the parental nest." who materializes during an improbable blind date. Smitten at first sight Mary breaks out the push-up bra and desperation. And because she�۪s a female character of a certain age in a romantic comedy she doesn�۪t just smooch she also swoons. Oblivious to the sound of Steve�۪s screeching tires she gives chase a decision that takes her from one news hot spot to another and into assorted humiliations. Happily for us the inert filmmaking comes with some quirky types whose comic faces and timing provide periodic if slight relief: so thank you Thomas Haden Church Katy Mixon D J Qualls Ken Jeong Jason Jones and for an eye blink Charlyne Yi." but she�۪s wrong for her role and her performance decisions ��� the tiny lisp fluttering hands trudging walk mincing run ��� are equally wide of the mark. You can appreciate her wanting to try something different but Ms. Bullock became a big star because she perfected an appealing type (likable unsinkable) that seems to align naturally with her off-screen persona. Her characters often start with a few knocks against them and might even be true sad sacks (���While You Were Sleeping�۝) but the ability to suffer beautifully has long been a prerequisite for female stardom. We wait in exquisite agony for those trembling lips to transform into a dazzling smile." alas just flap and flap and flap. A brainiac she rattles off multisyllabic words like a teenager prepping for college admission tests bombarding her understandably weary impatient and even panicked listeners with dictionary definitions encyclopedic notes and foreign-language phrases. The screenplay by Kim Barker (���License to Wed�۝) tries to insist that Mary isn�۪t damaged and simply needs to find the right tribe so she can let her freak flag proudly fly. But the concept of an intelligent woman is apparently so exotic to Ms. Bullock and her director Phil Traill that they frantically kook the character up as if female smarts were a kind of disability.

�۝ a lovely somewhat messy movie about lovely messy young lives cross paths only twice. The first time Axl (Fernando Tielve) a transplant from Spain by way of myriad anonymous flops is walking out of the sprawling London squat he unknowingly shares with a Frenchwoman Vera (D̩borah Fran̤ois). He�۪s wearing her striped school jacket which he retrieved from the kitchen where she had abandoned it. Axl is looking for someone and Vera wants to lose someone else though of course because this is about a pair of fledglings they are also looking for themselves." but one that the young Argentine director Alexis Dos Santos relates with such tenderness and with so much ethereal beauty that  it feels like something fresh. Mr. Dos Santos whose only other feature is the well-regarded ���Glue�۝ (2006) has nothing earthshaking to say about the agonies and ecstasies of youth in this newer work which played at the Sundance Film Festival and New Directors/New Films this year. (Although the colorful chaos of the squat does make being broke and underemployed look charming.) What he has is an elliptical narrative that makes a perfect vehicle for two characters whose uncertainties confusions and fractured romances ��� there are plenty of beds unmade and otherwise ��� are similarly oblique." reminiscing about his itinerant childhood with his mother. He�۪s come to London to find his father which he appears to do amid a confusion of strobing lights throbbing music pressing bodies and a lot of alcohol. After one such evening he ends up sandwiched between Hannah (Katia Winter) and Mike (Iddo Goldberg) who may or may not be lovers depending on the amount of booze and drugs consumed and whether the mood strikes them which it often does. Having been invited into this endless  bacchanal Axl moves into the squat where there�۪s an entire room of old mattresses for new arrivals." in dreamy patches that suit her romantic disposition and French-language voice-over. An old boyfriend glimpsed in fragmentary flashbacks is soon replaced by an attractive prospect (Michiel Huisman) whose name either out of fear or folly she refuses to learn. Having met in a somewhat inebriated haze the two end up in a hotel room staggering and falling down with laughter and drink. As he does with some scenes of Axl in bed with his lovers Mr. Dos Santos shoots Vera�۪s initial encounters  with this man as a series of disconnected images often with the background gently blurred. What he�۪s showing us  is the intimate exquisitely close details of discovery what you see  when your vision first narrows on another." almost begrudgingly succumbs to desire. Axl a forelock of hair obscuring one eye or another sees ��� and doesn�۪t ��� the father he yearns for. As he tags after these bodies at rest and in motion Mr. Dos Santos creates not just a vision  of community but also a larger sense of being in the world. The squatters find room for one another opening themselves and their beds to new possibilities. They make music and paint creating a multi-everything utopia that might seem far-fetched or even self-indulgent but has the allure of an ideal.

Lisandro Alonso is one of the more prominent filmmakers to emerge from Argentine cinema in the last few years. At the very least he has become a favorite on the international film festival circuit popping up at the usual ports of cinematic call like Cannes Toronto Rotterdam Hong Kong and Istanbul. The surface beauty and the formal elegance of his work have their obvious appeal as does Mr. Alonso�۪s provenance. This isn�۪t cynicism: international diversity is a crucial component of many festivals which often serve as vital platforms for national cinemas that must struggle against Hollywood domination." Mr. Alonso�۪s style which leans heavily on familiar art-cinema conventions seems calculated to bring him as modest an audience as possible. Like two of his somewhat better-known features ���La Libertad�۝ (2001) which played at the New York Film Festival and ���Los Muertos�۝ (2004) ���Liverpool�۝ turns on a single man who journeys from one world into another." where the crew seems all but lost amid the instrument panels and industrial guts. One day Farrel (Juan Fern��ndez) asks the captain if he can go ashore to visit his mother while the boat docks in Ushuaia the southernmost city in Argentina." his sharp planed face leaning into the wind. Surrounded by a snowy landscape that often dwarfs him he begins traveling. He hitches a ride eats in a restaurant and takes frequent gulps from a bottle. Eventually he reaches a town where after another lonely meal he continues nursing the bottle falling asleep in what looks like an outhouse. The next day some men rescue him from this inglorious throne and bring him to Trujillo (Nieves Cabrera) in a modest disheveled house. When Farrel wakes Trujillo greets him with a salutation that sounds like an accusation: ���What are you doing here?�۝ It�۪s a question that Mr. Alonso himself appears almost as reluctant to answer as his taciturn protagonist." by Lucio Bonelli and avoidance of dialogue intimates that Mr. Alonso is working in a realist tradition that owes a debt to observational documentary. Yet there�۪s also something bloodless almost clinical about his approach as if he were a naturalist conducting field research. You watch Farrel in his natural habitat (the cargo ship a warren of mystery and heavy metal). You watch him eat sleep and drink and eat sleep and drink some more. You observe him in different environments and engaging with others of his species including his bedridden mother and a young woman Analia (Giselle Irrazabal). In time the data ��� the lovely landscapes and unlovely people ��� accumulate and it�۪s up to you to draw your own conclusions." �۝ Mr. Alonso�۪s first feature which focuses on a woodcutter living almost wholly in isolation. The man�۪s trip from this solitary existence into the world suggested the larger evolutionary journey into community. A different voyage animates ���Los Muertos �۝ which tracks a released prisoner as he makes his way back to the scene of his crime where he seems poised to repeat his bloody ways a hint perhaps of Mr. Alonso�۪s ideas about our deepest nature. Although it has its visual pleasures and there�۪s plenty to admire about his compositions the journey in ���Liverpool�۝ seems comparatively slight despite Mr. Alonso�۪s efforts to wring feeling and meaning from characters whose silences I�۪m not really sure he even hears."

to judge by the square squat cut of his jib he�۪s an unlikely contender. He�۪s a regular guy or as close to regular as any 35-year-old can possibly be who sleeps under a poster of his favorite football star while tucked under a coverlet imprinted with the names of N.F.L. teams." ���Big Fan�۝ is about the love that speaks its name though also often shrieks it in rock arenas sports stadiums and other public places of worship. That love can be a beautiful touching thing: I still remember John Belushi kindly taking the time to sign an autograph that I soon threw away. I just wanted the contact with someone I adored (and being a teenager I had no idea of its possible market value). There�۪s a kind of grace in that kind of exchange as the idol recognizes the supplicant and if only during the seconds it takes to scrawl a name on a scrap of paper comes down to earth with the rest of us." two friends Paul (Patton Oswalt) and Sal (Kevin Corrigan) notice Paul�۪s favorite Giants player the fictional Quantrell Bishop (Jonathan Hamm) gassing up his S.U.V. Giddy with excitement the friends start tailing Bishop. They spend much of their days and most of their solitary nights obsessing about the Giants swapping stories about the team�۪s triumphs and defeats like war veterans so following him seems natural even if it means entering unknown territory like Manhattan. (Where an incredulous Paul marvels there are no parking spaces.) Then Bishop discovers he�۪s been shadowed and flies into a rage unleashing all the furious energy that makes him so magnificent on the field." his head wrapped in bandages. Much of what ensues involves his coming to painful terms with the horror of that violent night a reckoning that upends his life and a favorite late-evening ritual: his calls into a local sports radio show. These broadcast interludes are the high point of his day week perhaps life giving ���Paul from Staten Island �۝ as he�۪s called the chance to advocate on behalf of the Giants while trash-talking the competition. Reading from a notepad and pouring all his libidinal energy into the task he drops statistics predicts plays and taunts the enemy his voice alive with swagger and heat. More than an enthusiast he is a defender of the faith." a standup comic who also voiced Remy the rat in the Pixar animation ���Ratatouille �۝ seems to expand physically during these scenes almost as if his love for his team made him a giant too. He puffs out his chest and rocks a bit his voice ebbing and flowing with oratory grandiloquence. There�۪s no one around save for his mother (Marcia Jean Kurtz) in the bedroom next door who borrowing a favorite strategy from Rupert Pupkin�۪s  mom occasionally yells at him to shut up. But Paul has an audience including the admiring Sal who alone in his own apartment takes visible somewhat baffled pride in his friend�۪s radio performances smiling along to every beat. Being a big fan also makes Paul into something of a celebrity." here making his debut as a director doesn�۪t push the analogy. One of the pleasures of this agreeably low-key and modest film is that he isn�۪t selling a message or trying to wring a grand metaphor out of his humble material: he�۪s created a somewhat simple story about a man who turns out to be rather less simple than he first appears. Unlike his script for ���The Wrestler �۝ with its embarrassment of clich̩s and bucket of tears the screenplay for ���Big Fan�۝ avoids sentimentality without abandoning sentiment. Paul might make you squirm but Mr. Siegel refuses to sell him out so you can feel more comfortable with his eccentricities no small thing in contemporary independent cinema." Mr. Siegel finds a suitably grubby visual look for the film which  employs handheld camerawork  that alternately puts Paul at an analytical distance and draws him close. (Only when Paul dreams of Bishop do the colors pop.) The unremarkable settings include the gloomy  parking lot where Paul works and the much larger stadium parking lot where he and Sal watch Giant games on a TV run off a car engine. Like Paul�۪s bedroom these emptied-out liminal spaces in which other people are forever coming and going can seem terribly lonely even sad. But to feel sorry for him is to miss the point of ���Big Fan �۝ which is that a life filled with so much generous love needs no pity."

�۝ a quiet stirring film from the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda fit uneasily under the same roof. Set in a port city though largely played out in the tight boxy confines of a single home the film turns on a melancholic at times resentful and seethingly angry 15th-anniversary reunion to mark the death of the eldest son. Grief has brought the scattered family members together and at least at moments seems all that they have left in common." who also directed ���After Life�۝ and ���Nobody Knows �۝ can have a deceptively simple touch. In ���Still Walking �۝ the story builds through an accretion of details in shared glances gestures and conversation. As with the disordered arc of many family gatherings food is cooked and consumed amid a great deal of small talk and children laugh loudly and run free through the rooms. The drama such as it is enters obliquely coming to a slow boil in the bitter comments and sharp looks of the surviving son Ryota (Hiroshi Abe) and in the oppressive silences of his father a retired doctor Kyohei (Yoshio Harada). When Ryota arrives with his wife and stepson at his parents�۪ home his father simply grunts Oh you�۪re here." ���Still Walking�۝ is very much about what it means to return to a home that you helped create animating it with spirit and love (or rage or fear or despair) and then left behind. Like his brother whose absence fills the house and whose photograph takes unsettling pride of place on an altar Ryota has become something of a ghost. That�۪s true for many  adult children who can see their younger selves in every familiar and inviting ancestral nook. Here though the dead son so fully inhabits the consciousness of his parents ��� and by extension the house which in its gentle dilapidation has become a physical manifestation of them ��� there is little room for anyone else even other ghosts." well-tended resentments rise to the surface as do various hurts. The family�۪s only daughter Chinami (played by a monosyllabically named actress You) hopes to move her son daughter and cheerfully clueless husband into her parents�۪ home. Her mother Toshiko (Kirin Kiki) by far the most surprising character clearly doesn�۪t relish this projected home invasion. But she expresses her feelings about the proposed move to Ryota  only after Chinami�۪s family has left.  Because Mr. Kore-eda writes realistic characters rather than the self-actualized types you often find in the movies they  rarely express themselves with blunt force and never with perfectly scripted paragraphs detailing every slight. It�۪s this restraint rather than any change in volume that makes their brief displays of florid emotion so effective." the family often centered against the geometric patterns created by the shoji screens and open doorways. For the most part the camera moves around the house with the characters though at times Mr. Kore-eda pauses on a domestic still life lingering over a vase on a table or the tidied-up finally quiet kitchen. He seems to catch beauty on the fly as when the three grandchildren having gone for a walk reach for some overhanging flowers their fluttering fingers straining upward. There�۪s joy in this moment even if these three are also echoes of three other children: Ryota Chinami and their lost brother." Ryota and his family stay the night. (Chinami meanwhile packs up her brood and drives away fretting over the future.) As Ryota Mr. Abe a tall man who often has to duck to avoid smacking his head on entryways has to play the part of the malcontent. He fills out the role fine though the character�۪s sourness and dark looks grow somewhat wearisome. Yet Ryota�۪s unhappiness  is as crucial to the family�۪s dynamic as his father�۪s glowering and his  mother�۪s efficient defensive bustling. This is life as it�۪s lived not dreamed. And this is a family bound not only by sorrow but also by a shared history that emerges in 114 calibrated minutes and ends with a wallop." directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda; director of photography Yutaka Yamazaki; music by Gontiti; production designers Toshihiro Isomi and Keiko Mitsumatsu; produced by Yoshihiro Kato and Hijiri Taguchi; released by IFC Films.

�۝ a hyperventilated account of the rise and weird fall of the dot-com millionaire turned self-declared artist Josh Harris you might want to run home lower all the shades and unplug yourself from the Internet. Certainly Mr. Harris who earned a sizable fortune from different Internet ventures only to become increasingly consumed with issues of privacy control and surveillance �� a complex of obsessions that helped him lose much of  that fortune �� could have used some alone time." where he runs  an outfit called African Entertainment Network and remains as he says in the movie far from the reach of his creditors.  In 1986 he founded Jupiter  Communications an early Internet analysis and consulting firm. In 1994 after making a tidy profit from the sale of that company he created  Pseudo Programs an online television company that because broadband was still years away was the right idea with the wrong technology. That company filed for bankruptcy   when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 but by then Mr. Harris was  suffering his own meltdown at times while made up like a clown called Luvvy named after a character on ���Gilligan�۪s Island.�۝" Mr. Harris appears to have in part steered his life into the shoals through ruinously expensive follies. In the first he sealed some 100  volunteers in a bunker in Manhattan wired with cameras and outfitted with guns. He called this 1999 project ���Quiet: We Live in Public �۝ though it was anything but. Over their month of confinement these pod people turned progressively rowdier letting it all hang out sometimes while weeping and screaming for the viewing pleasure of the other inhabitants." the director and writer of ���We Live in Public �۝ to shoot the experiment which explains the wealth of images in this movie. Some of the more disturbing ones invoke the bullying techniques of discredited self-help groups like EST. The bunker itself suggests a wired version of a model prison designed by the 18th-century British philosopher Jeremy Bentham that he called the Panopticon which allows a guardian to watch inmates who because of the structure�۪s design can never see that they�۪re being observed. This constant surveillance would become an instrument of control because the prisoners not knowing if they were being watched would out of uncertainty behave as if they were. Not surprisingly Bentham�۪s design has become a favorite metaphor for life in the surveillance age." the ubiquity of the cameras and monitors meant that their actions were part of a visual stream that blurred their individual actions turning them into an undifferentiated mass. It�۪s no wonder that some of the participants Ms. Timoner later interviewed likened the experience to fascism. Mr. Harris wasn�۪t a fascist of course just a manipulator of sizable economic means whose motivations ethics  and sanity were all in question. He compared himself to  Warhol an analogy some journalists ignorantly parroted but he comes off as a rich bully who enjoyed buying other people�۪s time and even their tears. (In the movie�۪s production notes he is described as a ���professional artist.�۝)" Tanya Corrin with whom he lived online  in constant view of anyone with a computer. There were cameras in the bedroom the litter box and even the toilet bowl a vantage point that offered viewers images that perhaps more than most revealed how Mr. Harris felt about other people. The happy couple soon soured turning to the project�۪s chat room for company and later relationship solace. As she does with the ���Quiet�۝  project Ms. Timoner weaves in chunks of this increasingly unpleasant second endeavor weliveinpublic.com with a cacophony of music and colorful graphics along with witnesses who against the odds try to wring sense from Mr. Harris�۪s mess." but she doesn�۪t seriously engage with the issues her documentary raises including whether the right to privacy will survive given how eagerly so many now surrender themselves to the camera. At one point she describes ���Quiet�۝  as a metaphor for how Mr. Harris believed we would live in the Internet age. Later citing the example of how online sites mine our data she asserts: ���We all willingly share this information. We enjoy the attention the feedback the comments.�۝" but she doesn�۪t explore the nuances. From the ample evidence Mr. Harris�۪s own life in public was a bust. Ms. Timoner  sees him as a cautionary tale as well as a visionary; what I see is that as with many things too much ���Gilligan�۪s Island�۝ can be bad for you."

�۝ a documentary about the creation of a single very fat issue of American Vogue in a far-off gilded age (i.e. 2007) has little to say about fashion the real ins and outs of publishing or the inner workings and demons of the magazine�۪s notoriously demanding meanie-in-chief Anna Wintour. Rather this entertaining glib movie is about the maintenance of a brand that Ms. Wintour has brilliantly cultivated since she assumed her place at the top of the editorial masthead in 1988 and which the documentary�۪s director R. J. Cutler has helped polish with a take so flattering he might as well work there." however if Mr. Cutler did work for the exacting Ms. Wintour he would still be doing reshoots. Shot on digital with an eye for sumptuous color by Bob Richman and briskly edited by Azin Samari the  88-minute movie opens with Ms. Wintour explaining that ���there is something about fashion that can make people very nervous.�۝ Certainly she unnerves her staff as you soon see from all the huddled bodies and popping eyes. Even the more self-possessed like Candy Pratts Price seem in the grip of awe. Is Ms. Wintour the ���high priestess�۝ of the magazine an off-camera voice asks. ���I would say  pope �۝ Ms. Price says with a queasy smile." having already watched supplicants kiss the ring in the 2006 film ���The Devil Wears Prada �۝ with Meryl Streep as a thinly disguised fictionalized and Americanized version of Ms. Wintour. Etched in acid and often hilarious the performance while not wholly modeled on Ms. Wintour helped humanize her public profile lessening the sting of the original book a roman �� clef by one of her former assistants Lauren Weisberger. The documentary continues this humanization largely by showing Ms. Wintour very hard at work rather lonely and sensitive about her British family�۪s low opinion of fashion. She�۪s a poor little rich girl swaddled in fur and iced to the bone." perhaps at times accidentally so. Much of the movie�۪s pleasure comes from the utter ease with which Ms. Wintour plays the Red Queen of fashion and orders off with their heads (and even tummies). In the case of the British actress Sienna Miller the cover girl for the September 2007 issue which gives the movie its structure and hook the head in question receives the 21st-century version of a severing: it�۪s Photoshopped to unreal perfection. However lovely Ms. Miller proves a problematic Vogue ideal for the editors many of whose own faces are somewhat surprisingly scored with wrinkles. It�۪s a mark of how pitiless Ms. Wintour can come across that you end up feeling a bit sorry for Ms. Miller." there�۪s cruelty here but of the most attenuated kind: she says no employees tremble. The strongest like the flame-haired Grace Coddington the magazine�۪s longtime creative director and the documentary�۪s hugely diverting stealth star seem to have figured out how to survive with their dignity intact. Most of the truly ugly stuff in fashion �� the models  starving themselves the exploited Chinese workers cranking  out couture fakes and the animals inhumanely slaughtered for their fur �� remains unnoted in ���The September Issue �۝ much as it often does in Vogue. And while the movie shuns any overt discussion of money it includes an instructive scene of Ms. Wintour playing the coquette with one of the magazine�۪s important advertisers." weird unattractive ridiculous and prohibitively expensive clothes and accessories Vogue isn�۪t about fashion: it�۪s about stoking the desire for those clothes and accessories. It�۪s about the creation of lust and the transformation of wants into needs. Almost everything in this temple of consumption including its lavish layouts and the celebrities who now most often adorn its covers hinges on stuff for sale. Some of that stuff comes with a price tag but some of it is more ephemeral because Vogue is also in the aspiration business. Mr. Cutler doesn�۪t notice or doesn�۪t care about any of that which makes his movie as facile as it is fun." it�۪s no surprise that Ms. Wintour is doing her part to flog the documentary: she gave a party in its honor and recently appeared on David Letterman�۪s show with and without her signature sunglasses her glazed stare and tight smile firmly in place. The movie affords you many opportunities to marvel at the parsimony of that smile and wonder if she�۪s as bored as she looks even while waiting for an agitated Stefano Pilati the creative director at Yves Saint Laurent to show his newest collection." �۝ she says in a voice so drained of affect it�۪s a wonder he doesn�۪t commit seppuku with his scissors. You feel bad for Mr. Pilati but it�۪s Ms. Wintour�۪s hauteur that makes you laugh and keeps you willingly at her side."

Samuel L. Jackson Danny Glover and Julia Stiles at least merits notice. But the formidable talent and serious intention poured into Giancarlo Esposito�۪s ���Gospel Hill�۝ go only a tiny way toward enlivening an overpopulated film with an excess of mechanical subplots and deadly expository dialogue." ���Gospel Hill�۝ is a social microcosm set in a small South Carolina town that 40 years after the fact is still recovering from an unsolved murder. Ms. Bassett�۪s fiery self-possession brings a spark of passion to her stick-figure character Sarah the daughter-in-law of Paul Malcolm (Mr. Jackson at his least charismatic) a local civil rights leader who was shot to death in 1968 and is shown in black-and-white flashbacks.

humane movie is not an attempt to recreate the epochal Woodstock Music and Art Fair captured in Michael Wadleigh�۪s documentary ���Woodstock.�۝ It is essentially a small intimate film into which is fitted a peripheral view of the landmark event that took place on Aug. 15 through 18 1969 on a dairy farm in Bethel N.Y. and has since been exalted ad nauseam for its good vibes." a shabby Catskills motel in White Lake N.Y. not far from the site on which 32 acts including Crosby Stills Nash & Young the Who and Jimi Hendrix made rock music history." golden circle glimpsed in the far distance amid a throbbing acid haze outside the van of a gentle hippie couple. The music heard during the trip scene ���The Red Telephone�۝ by the Los Angeles band Love emanates not from the stage but from speakers inside the van where the couple initiates a shy young stranger into the mysteries of LSD." ���Ride With the Devil �۝ which was set on the war�۪s western fringe ���Taking Woodstock�۝ operates on the principle that contemplation of historic events from the margins can be more revealing than from the hot center. Although it shows an immense traffic jam fields littered with trash and hippies gleefully sliding through mud ���Taking Woodstock�۝ pointedly shies away from spectacle the better to focus on how the lives of individuals caught up by history are transformed. Structurally the film resembles the event it remembers. The screenplay by Mr. Lee�۪s longtime collaborator James Schamus (he also wrote the script for ���Ride With the Devil�۝) is open-ended and episodic. No one predicted the scale of the horde estimated at half a million that would descend on Bethel with limited supplies of food and water in unsettled weather. Any number of disasters could have turned what was billed as ���An Aquarian Exposition�۝ promising ���3 Days of Peace & Music�۝ into a massive bummer." Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin) from whose memoir ���Taking Woodstock: A True Story of a Riot a Concert and a Life�۝ (written with Tom Monte) the film was adapted is a mild-mannered semicloseted gay interior decorator who has been living in Greenwich Village. As played by Mr. Martin he suggests an earnest sad-sack cousin of Dustin Hoffman�۪s Benjamin Braddock in ���The Graduate.�۝ For all its believability Mr. Martin�۪s performance lacks the star magnetism that emanated from Mr. Hoffman playing an even more reticent character." Jake (Henry Goodman) and Sonia (Imelda Staunton) Jews who immigrated from Russia keep afloat their financially failing motel. As the head of Bethel�۪s Chamber of Commerce Elliot offers the motel as a home base for the promoters of Woodstock Ventures after the company loses its permit for an arts festival in the nearby town of Wallkill." the dairy farm�۪s owner and Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff) the festival�۪s prime mover to make a deal. Mr. Groff�۪s Lang is presented as a suave hippie capitalist with a streak of grandiosity; he appears knightlike atop a horse near the end of the movie." meandering celebration of personal liberation at a moment when rigid social barriers were becoming more permeable at least among the young. Elliot and his parents lead the list of those experiencing pangs of enlightenment amid the hippie swarm." the movie explicitly connects Woodstock to the gay-liberation movement and the Stonewall riots which took place two months earlier that summer. A friend of Elliot�۪s even brings to the motel a record by Judy Garland who had died a few days before the Stonewall uprising; some have theorized that grief over her death was a precipitating factor in the riots." Elliot is cuddled and caressed by both the girl and the boy. The trip sequence is one of the most benign to be shown in any movie peddling period psychedelia. Elliot also takes inspiration from Vilma (Liev Schreiber) a ferociously masculine kindhearted cross-dressing Marine who appears at the motel and provides its security." Jake and the grim penny-pinching Sonia surrender their inhibitions after ingesting some hash brownies and suffer a major case of the giggles. The healing also extends to Elliot�۪s high school friend Billy (Emile Hirsch) a paranoid Vietnam veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder." a visiting avant-garde theater troupe whose members use any excuse to disrobe collectively.

(ESPN seems to have missed an opportunity though: the film is coming out two weeks after this year�۪s X Games 15 in Los Angeles.) It consists of competition from the 2008 summer and 2009 winter games intercut with profiles of prominent action sports stars like the dirt-biker Kyle Loza the skateboarder Danny Way and the multitalented Travis Pastrana." the most startling realization here will be  that the X Games have been around for 15 years. Those who follow sports (but not extreme sports) will note that the techniques Roone Arledge pioneered more than 40 years ago in ���Wide World of Sports�۝ at ABC have not been improved upon and that they adapt well to the human drama of athletic exhibitionism." which takes over the last section of the movie is an occasional callousness or contemptuousness on the part of the commentators (when they�۪re not mindlessly cheering). ���You can�۪t back out of tricks like that �۝ one says after a competitor fails to complete an unprecedented forward flip on a motorcycle." who come off as personable voluble sensation addicts  obsessed with creating the next ��� and inevitably more dangerous ��� trick.

in this case apparently a suicide and the toxin leaks all over the place. After watching this extreme satire written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait you may never want to attend another memorial for anyone at which tearful testimonials are read gooey ballads sung and the memory of the deceased slathered with mawkish bromides. With a merciless acuity this nihilistic comedy ridicules collective grief and the news media�۪s cynical marketing of inspirational uplift after a death. Ultimately it scorns the human impulse to find a deeper meaning in any tragedy." Kyle (Daryl Sabara) is the furthest thing from the shining young Apollos whose early deaths have sparked a literary subgenre since ���A Separate Peace.�۝ A pudgy foulmouthed bigoted not-so-bright loser obsessed with masturbation and the grossest pornography Kyle has only one friend Andrew (Evan Martin) a skinny quivering reed of a boy with whom he occasionally does homework."

It intensifies into a national mediathon after Lance concocts a phony journal kept by his son titled ���You Don�۪t Know Me.�۝" many viewed with undisguised contempt are barely sketched stereotypes. Clarie in particular is a vapid chirpy narcissist who juggles Lance�۪s affections with those of Mike (Henry Simmons) an English teacher who to Lance�۪s silent chagrin has his first story published in The New Yorker." Mr. Williams�۪s Lance remains a poker-faced enigma. Early scenes show him struggling to communicate with Kyle who loathes his father and is ashamed to be seen with him.

I admired it but with some reservations. This musical story of adolescent rebellion and artistic self-discovery written by Stew (with music by him and Heidi Rodewald) from the raw material of Stew�۪s own life simmered with energy and ideas with sonic and verbal wit but it also strained for a soaring transcendent theatricality that it could not quite achieve. The show�۪s rootedness in the swerves and bumps of an individual biography struck me as admirable but also limiting and its themes of creative ambition racial identity and the search for that elusive thing called the real seemed to lie too heavily on the surface." ���Passing Strange: The Movie �۝ in effect a video recording of a performance identical to the one I�۪d witnessed at the Belasco Theater in 2008 I was blown away. Loose ends ceased to dangle; soft spots were smoothed away and slow passages tightened up. Some of this may lie in my own preference for the cognitive solitude of movie-watching over the self-conscious sociability of theatergoing but Mr. Lee�۪s contribution as well as that of the cinematographer Matthew Libatique should not be discounted." emphasizing both the play�۪s artifice and its fidelity to emotional facts. The members of the small cast several of whom take on multiple roles are shown in the full sweaty glory of self-transformation. (The band present onstage and led by Ms. Rodewald works pretty hard too.) And as Stew a stout man in a red shirt and a dark suit narrates and comments on the doings and dreamings of his younger angrier thinner and similarly dressed self (the excellent Daniel Breaker) changes of angle and focus illuminate the emotional distance between hotheaded youth and rueful middle age." as Wordsworth said is father of the man. Or as Stew puts it ���adulthood is the consequence of decisions made by a teenager.�۝ And while there is a measure of sad wisdom in this observation and in the raised brows and weary headshakes with which Stew now reflects on Stew then ���Passing Strange�۝ celebrates the same foolish heedless passion that it mocks and sometimes regrets. The show does two contradictory things at once both brilliantly: it captures the impatient emergence of a budding artistic personality with a perfect mixture of sympathy and skepticism and also reckons the sometimes devastating costs of a young artist�۪s desire to set himself free and make himself real." in equal measure from postmodern literary theory and from hip-hop �� begins in Los Angeles in the 1970s.

Looming over all these abandonments is the mother whose plaintive calls interrupt Stew�۪s European journey even as her checks underwrite it." privileged kid wandering through foreign capitals dabbling in legal drugs sexual exploration radical politics and avant-garde art. That this highly unflattering interpretation lingers around the edges of ���Passing Strange�۝ is a tribute to the musical�۪s good-natured unassuming honesty. And it is Stew�۪s refusal to sentimentalize his life that makes him a trustworthy guide to it. But at the same time his refusal to condescend to the desire to wrest art from experience or to the crystallizations of that desire in Los Angeles garages or Berlin cabarets makes ���Passing Strange�۝ moving thrilling and new." a pastiche of styles given coherence by the rumble of Stew�۪s voice and the snarl and wail of his electric guitar. ���Passing Strange�۝ is less a collection of songs �� though there are a few most notably ���Keys (Marianna) �۝ that stand out �� than a single headlong piece of music.

�۝ a taut unnerving forcefully unromantic fictional film about a West German terrorist group whose founders ran bloodily amok in the 1970s opens with a bright sparkling image of children playing on a beach. It�۪s 1967 and two of the children are the twin daughters of Ulrike Meinhof (Martina Gedeck) a respected journalist who one day jumped out of a window  while helping a prisoner Andreas Baader (Moritz Bleibtreu) escape. The moment she jumped Meinhof left  her world behind for a life of revolutionary zealotry and nihilistic violence. She traded her typewriter for a gun her children too." �۝ which Bernd Eichinger   adapted from Stefan Aust�۪s  book of the same title.  For the most part relying heavily on the historical record Mr. Eichinger  lets the group do its own talking as does the film�۪s director Uli Edel who gives it  the pulse and music of a thriller. (The propulsive score echoes those of the ���Bourne�۝ movies.) This probably accounts for why some have accused the film of glamorizing terrorism which misses the point that all terrorism is performative. What it   does show from the inside out is how a group of people graduated from theoretical debates to guns from hanging up a photo of Che to embracing revolutionary martyrdom." Mr. Aust�۪s book owes much of its power to its exacting detail and to his familiarity with the group which self-importantly labeled itself the Red Army Faction. A journalist he wrote for the leftist newspaper co-founded  by Meinhof�۪s husband for which she was a columnist and had extolled the ���progressive�۝ virtues of arson. Mr. Aust who shows up at the edges of the film played by Volker Bruch helped rescue her children whom she had handed off to minders while she was on the run. Ceding to pressure from the group she had agreed that the girls could be taken to a Palestinian orphanage in Jordan where Mr. Aust writes they were to be raised as guerrillas." �۝  Meinhof wrote before the faction formed ���between the police terrorist methods we have already seen in Berlin and that threaten us now and the terrorism of the SA�۝ ��� the Nazi Sturmabteilung or storm troopers ��� ���in the 1930s.�۝ For the Red Army Faction the enemies included American imperialism and what it saw as an emerging West German police state: in May 1972 it bombed  a police station a newspaper and several United States Army sites. It also set off a bomb inside a Volkswagen owned by a judge. That morning however it was his wife who turned the ignition key. She lived." as an American might they suggest how the political converged with the personal against a global backdrop of social protest movements political assassinations and increasingly repressive state reactions. They also offer plenty of proof that some in the group particularly Baader got off on the thrill of it all. Having sex and shooting he once said without evident irony are the same." played by Ms. Gedeck as something of a mouse itching to roar doesn�۪t come off as an obvious guerrilla. In one scene though you see the woman she was and her tremors of discontent. It�۪s early still before her great leap and she�۪s in her backyard with friends dancing and laughing and mingling. Her husband quiets the crowd and asks Meinhof to read her latest column which has been reprinted on a flier.  Casting shy smiles at the partyers she reads a passionate open letter of protest to the shah�۪s wife ticking off various outrages including the torture of Iranian  dissidents. As she finishes reading the film cuts to a long shot that frames Meinhof against the large stately middle-class house she will soon abandon." an insult that to judge from her relatively passive reaction in the film she absorbed into her being. Terror takes different forms. And Baader who continually lashes out at the women in the group ��� his zealot girlfriend Gudrun Ensslin played by Johanna Wokalek is as much his baby sitter as lover ��� was a tyrant. Opportunism rather than ideology seemed to drive him as shown in the very funny borderline surreal sequence in Jordan where the faction had gone to train with a Palestinian group. Baader in his tight velvet pants didn�۪t take to the rigorous drills and the Palestinians offended by the women�۪s nude sunbathing didn�۪t take to their visitors either." where by 1977 they and successive iterations of the faction ended up killing almost 30 people. In the end the Red Army Faction attracted extraordinary sympathy throughout West   Germany along with true-believers who formed new generations of the group even as the founders languished in prison. The group�۪s members who feared a police state and whose  actions only brought the government�۪s fist down harder were players in a real-life thriller that turned into a national tragedy. Theirs is a terrible mesmerizing story of curdled idealism one that has been told before but rarely as well. The faction is gone now (it disbanded in 1998) but its legacy still burns." a weary West German  official  (the great Bruno Ganz) says at one point. His words fall on deaf ears." based on the book by Stefan Aust and in consultation with Mr. Aust; director of photography Rainer Klausmann; edited by Alexander Berner; music by Peter Hinderth�_r and Florian Tessloff; production designer Bernd Lepel; produced by Mr. Eichinger; released by Vitagraph Films.

smiling laughing Nazi in ���Inglourious Basterds �۝ Quentin Tarantino�۪s latest cinematic happening sweeps onto the screen he owns this film even more than its maker. Played by a little-known Austrian actor Christoph Waltz Col. Hans Landa is a vision of big-screen National Socialist villainy from the smart cut of his SS coat to the soft gleam of his leather boots. There might be a fearsome skull (the death�۪s head or totenkopf) grinning on his cap but Colonel Landa has us at hallo." �۝ first shown at the Cannes Film Festival in May is Mr. Tarantino�۪s sixth feature. (The bifurcated ���Kill Bill�۝ is really one film.)  In many respects it looks and as important sounds like a typical Tarantino production with its showboating performances encyclopedic movie references and streams of self-conscious dialogue. The whistling on the soundtrack comes from the Sergio Leone composer Ennio Morricone and the American avenger Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) is a nod to the Hollywood actor Aldo Ray a sandpaper-voiced 1950s Everyman who often seemed most at ease wearing Army fatigues as he does in Anthony Mann�۪s 1957 masterpiece ���Men in  War.�۝ (Mr. Ray�۪s widow Johanna Ray served as one of the casting directors for ���Inglourious Basterds.�۝)" the inglourious basterds of the misspelled title who occupy one part of the sprawling narrative and whose numbers include a bat-wielding American nicknamed the Bear Jew (the director Eli Roth dreadful). Also elbowing for attention is a young French Jew Shosanna  Dreyfus (M̩lanie Laurent) who�۪s running a cinema in Paris under a pseudonym and a German Army hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Br�_hl) who dangerously woos her unaware of her true identity. There�۪s the British film critic turned spy Lt. Archie Hicox (a very good Michael Fassbender) and the German movie star turned spy Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger). Mostly though there is Landa whose unctuous charm beautifully modulated by Mr. Waltz gives this unwieldy dragging movie a much-needed periodic jolt." who introduces her to Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth). Landa swans in and a ludicrous plot to kill Hitler is unveiled. The fourth chapter throws in an unrecognizable Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill a barely recognizable Mike Myers as a British commander and a risible fiction: a suave film critic (Mr. Fassbender)." though there�۪s plenty to gag on as well. Much depends on whether you can just groove on his framing and staging his swooping crane shots postmodern flourishes (Samuel L. Jackson in voice-over explaining the combustibility of nitrate prints) and gorgeously saturated colors one velvety red in particular. The film�۪s opening sequence much of which takes place inside the restricted confines of a farmhouse room is a marvel of choreographed camera movement and tightly coordinated performances. When the scene moves inside the farmhouse you admire how neatly the German soldiers outside are positioned within one of the windows a shot that recalls the framing of an image in Monte Hellman�۪s 1971 cult classic ���Two-Lane Blacktop.�۝" it opens with a dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) chopping wood. As his ax looms ominously in the foreground of the shot he readies himself for some unwelcome German visitors. Colonel Landa nicknamed the Jew Hunter has come looking for hidden prey a task for which he is as he explains in a long verbal jag eminently suitable. Because Germans are like hawks Landa explains most cannot think like Jews who are more like rats ��� a characterization that of course was a privileged metaphor and ideological instrument in the Nazi�۪s campaign against European Jewry." and Mr. Waltz�۪s performance is so very good so persuasive seductive and crucially so distracting that you can readily move past the moment if you choose. Mr. Tarantino makes it easy to do just that by capping this exegesis with an abrupt sight gag: after asking the farmer if he can smoke Landa pulls out a pipe so comically large it immediately undercuts his threat transforming him from a ferocious Jew hunter into a silly man whose flamboyant pipe suggests he suffers from some masculinity issues." as they do in this film because Landa has already guessed there are Jews hiding where you might expect to find rats under the floorboards. Mr. Tarantino reveals them in their hiding place the camera slipping through the floor to show the terrified family members prostrate their hands over their mouths and eyes wide in fear. It�۪s a shocking moment partly because this image resonates with horror but it�۪s also shocking because it comes cushioned with laughs. Yet the shock dissipates because the Jews are irrelevant here. What matters is how he builds the tension with unnerving quiet and a camera that circles Landa and the farmer like an ever-tightening rope. What matters to Mr. Tarantino is the filmmaking." though he can have trouble putting those together a difficulty that has sometimes been obscured by the clever temporal kinks in his earlier work. He has also turned into a bad editor of his own material (his nominal editor as usual is Sally Menke) and seems unwilling or incapable of telling his A material from his B. The conversations in ���Inglourious Basterds�۝ are often repetitive and overlong and they rarely sing in part because the period setting doesn�۪t allow him to raid his vast pop-cultural storehouse. A joke about Wiener schnitzel just doesn�۪t pop like the burger riff in ���Pulp Fiction.�۝" at times gleeful embrace and narrative elevation of the seductive Nazi villain ��� can largely be explained as a problem of form. Landa simply has no equal in the film no counterpart who can match him in verbal dexterity and charisma who can be the Jules Winnfield and Mia Wallace to his Vincent Vega as Mr. Jackson and Uma Thurman are to John Travolta in ���Pulp Fiction.�۝ Leading with his chin Mr. Pitt gets off some funny lines particularly when he�۪s pulling his Southern-flavored vowels out like chewed gum but the character is too broadly drawn to carry weight. The same holds true of Ms. Laurent a pretty face who all but slides off the screen." its repellent invocation of the Holocaust crematoriums in the final blowout and calculated use of the Jews-as-rat metaphor are not vulgar in the extreme. Mr. Tarantino likes to push hard against accepted norms as his chortling exploitation of spectacular violence and insistent use of a noxious epithet for blacks  has shown in the past. But complaining about tastelessness in a Quentin Tarantino movie is about as pointless as carping about its hyperbolic violence: these are as much a constituent part of his work as the reams of dialogue. This  is after all a man who has an Oscar for a movie with a monologue about a watch stashed in a rectum." and neither are fascinating fascists as evidenced by Ralph Fiennes�۪s Oscar-nominated turn in ���Schindler�۪s List.�۝ Unlike those in ���Schindler�۪s List �۝ Mr. Tarantino�۪s Nazis exist in an insistently fictional cinematic space where heroes and villains converge amid a welter of movie allusions. He�۪s not making a documentary or trying to be Steven Spielberg: Mr. Tarantino is really only serious about his own films not history. In that sense ���Inglourious Basterds �۝ which takes its title if not its misspellings from an Italian flick in ���The Dirty Dozen�۝ vein is simply another testament to his movie love. The problem is that by making the star attraction of his latest film a most delightful Nazi one whose smooth talk is as lovingly presented as his murderous violence Mr. Tarantino has polluted that love." and Mr. Tarantino likes showing their knife work in graphic detail."

Years later the adult Alistair and Joe (Mr. Nesbitt) are being chauffeured in separate cars to a reunion orchestrated for television during which they are meant to express their long-simmering feelings. This bid at truth and reconciliation doesn�۪t go as planned even as the story finally follows a familiar narrative arc." a German director best known for ���Downfall �۝ makes you forget the gimmicky setup by just letting his two fine leads do their thing interweaving their conversations with their drivers with intermittent flashbacks to the scene of the 1975 crime. Mr. Nesbitt his head bobbing and weaving plays a man whose anguish appears to be shaking him up from the inside out knocking and rattling around his guts rib cage head. When the movie cuts from Mr. Nesbitt sweating and fidgeting (and talking) in his car to a flashback of his mother yelling at him when he was a child (she irrationally blames him for his brother�۪s death) you can well imagine that her angry shouts still reverberate in his ear." by contrast who can loom so large on screen at first seems somewhat physically diminished in the constrained space of a car his big body shrouded by the low lighting. He�۪s also still as stone eerily becalmed. (Later you realize that part of Alistair is already dead.) He talks in low soothing tones about Joe expressing concern for the other man�۪s welfare almost as if he were a priest or a therapist.

Seeing the dramatic potential in this nonmeeting Mr. Hibbert worked with them on the script though the two didn�۪t meet. Writing a fictional version of their lives might have helped them.

�۝ a streamlined adrenalized thriller that is not as deep as it would like to appear treads a retrospective political tightrope. Loosely adapted by the Canadian director Kari Skogland from Martin McGartland�۪s 1997 memoir (written with Nicholas Davies)  of his years as a spy infiltrating the Irish Republican Army it doesn�۪t take sides. But how can a film that deals with such explosive passions (bygone or not) be entirely evenhanded? Once Martin (Jim Sturgess) its Irish Catholic hooligan turned informer undertakes his perilous work you pray he will avoid exposure." mustached petty crook whose anarchic impulses and daredevil nature are channeled into espionage.

Martin is recruited by the occupying British Army to insinuate himself into the I.R.A. The film which only sketchily relates the history of the Troubles implies that politics have less to do with his acceptance of the job than the money the car he is given and the cliff-hanging thrill of it all." Martin�۪s world-weary contact and the movie�۪s resident philosopher of duplicity tells him that his work will save lives.

which is a mixed blessing. It�۪s nice to have Mr. Van Peebles who grows more charismatic with age (he turns 77 on Friday) back in the center of the action after projects like the French-language curiosity ���Bellyful�۝ (2000) and the formulaic corrupt-cops television movie  ���Gang in Blue�۝ (1996) where his on-screen presence was secondary at best. It�۪s disappointing though to see that his work while it�۪s become more polished has remained essentially self-indulgent and superficial despite the big themes of racism and identity that it takes on." �۝ which is a largely seamless coherent exercise doesn�۪t look much like the rough-edged ���Sweetback �۝ but it still resonates with that earlier film. Once again the soundtrack is filled almost entirely with music composed by Mr. Van Peebles in styles ranging from jazz vamps to blues songs to gospel to Broadway-style light opera. Once again Mr. Van Peebles�۪s protagonist finds himself on the run trying to escape across the mountains except this time his pursuers are African soldiers rather than Los Angeles policemen. And once again the road to freedom is paved with the naked bodies of compliant women who can�۪t keep their hands off an African-American stud even one who in this case is well past 70." which is one long flashback recounting the life of its title character Mr. Van Peebles is both narrator and actor playing the doofus at all ages: child in a Chicago tenement; teenager washing dishes in Harlem; young man traveling the world with the merchant marine; older and wiser man (hence ���ex�۝ doofus) returning to New York and the woman he loves. There�۪s some charm and sly humor in scenes of Mr. Van Peebles at the dinner table being lectured by a mother (Tamiko White) who is 40 or more years his junior; there isn�۪t (not for me in any case) in the sequence in which he tries to feel up a succession of young women in dark theaters." with its echoes of Mark Twain and Chester Himes is told in a kind of poetic cartoon style  ��� the Fleischer brothers appear to have been another muse  ��� with much handmade manipulation of the images.

While it doesn�۪t seem particularly autobiographical beyond the Chicago childhood it�۪s clearly a narrative that the artist has had rattling around in his head for a long time." regardless of any other calculations that were involved an act of bravery a slap in the face of the movie business and white American society. ���Ex-Doofus�۝ is a better film in every technical sense  ��� people who had trouble sitting through ���Sweetback�۝ are likely to find ���Ex-Doofus�۝ tolerable and even pleasantly diverting  ��� but a lesser one where it matters.

Eventually Ver�_nica gets out of the car as raindrops from an impending storm pelt the windshield. All this takes place before the film�۪s opening titles." she appears disoriented. She confesses to Marcos that she thinks she killed someone on the road. Juan Manuel visits and uses his connections with  the police to inquire if there have been reports of a fatality near the canal; the answer is no." as Ver�_nica and family members are driving on the same road they come upon a crew dredging the canal now filled with water from the storm where a body has been discovered blocking a pipe.

how rarely they sweep us up in ecstatic reverie. It�۪s a giddy touchingly resonant image of freedom ��� the animated girl is as liberated from shoes as from the laws of nature ��� one that the director Hayao Miyazaki lingers on only as long as it takes your eyes and mind to hold it close love it deeply and immediately regret its impermanence." her eyes wildly fixed on a small car perilously whipping around hairpin bends in a raucous storm. Her name is Ponyo (gurgled and voiced by Noah Cyrus Miley�۪s younger sister) and she was once some kind of half-human half-fish daughter of the sea. But she found a boy the 5-year-old Sosuke (Frankie Jonas yet another one of those brothers) or rather he found her rescuing her by scooping her into a pail. The two were separated ��� as fated characters invariably are ��� but she�۪s found him. Now as she races along the surface of huge peaking waves she has summoned up by the force of her power Ponyo is expressing not only her bliss but also ours." the influential Japanese animator who has advanced the art with films like ���Princess Mononoke �۝ ���Spirited Away�۝ and ���Howl�۪s Moving Castle.�۝ The new film despite the initial distractions of the recognizable voices crammed into the English-language version (a subdued Matt Damon a fine Betty White) shares thematic and visual similarities with his earlier work notably its emphasis on the natural world its tumults and fragility. (As Mr. Miyazaki once put it ���All my animation and comics involve land sea and sky ��� they all revolve around what happens on earth.�۝) But ���Ponyo �۝ which takes some inspiration from ���The Little Mermaid �۝ Hans Christian Andersen�۪s macabre fairy tale has a narrative simplicity or rather the clarity of a distillation." there is nothing remotely ghoulish about ���Ponyo.�۝ No blood and only a few anxious tears are spilled. Far more than Mr. Miyazaki�۪s other recent films this one obviously has been  created for young viewers who will have no trouble grasping its broad story or understanding why the characters do what they do as when Sosuke worried about prowling cats places a leaf over the pail with the goldfish girl. At that point Ponyo is as big as Sosuke�۪s hand. With her broadly smiling pale human face and wiggling red fish body she looks a little like one of the girls that the Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara likes to draw minus the scowl. She also looks a bit like a well-dressed tadpole." with their clean lines and bright splashes of color Ponyo tends to pop slightly on the screen. Although Mr. Miyazaki  eschews the deep space of 3-D animation (over his dead body as he recently suggested) he is acutely sensitive to texture an awareness that translates into different visual designs for individual scenes and which intensifies the emotional register of those same scenes. The softly smudged field of grass that surrounds Sosuke�۪s house like a blanket is striking partly because you can see the touch of the human hand in each blade. The blurred pastel quality of the grass the softness of this green mantle convey a feeling of comfort that in turn summons up words like warmth home love." Ponyo�۪s father a wizard named Fujimoto (Liam Neeson) practices his mysterious art. From the prow of a submerged vessel Fujimoto ��� the long tendrils of his rusty red hair waving around his head like octopus tentacles ��� releases potions that restore the health of the pollution-choked waters." particularly when he gently and very cleanly curses the human world and its harmful ways as something of a Miyazaki self-portrait. Whatever the case like his creator Fujimoto can�۪t keep Ponyo under wraps: she springs from the sea exploding into the world with a reckless infectious almost calamitous exuberance." or maybe it�۪s the image of childhood right before culture takes over and initiates its relentless tsk-tsking telling us to mind our manners shut our mouths and sit up in our seats. Smitten with Sosuke Ponyo decides she wants to be human a wish that involves a visit from her mother (Cate Blanchett) and almost upends the balance of the world. As in the original Andersen fairy tale which turns on a mermaid who dies because she falls in love with a landlocked prince humanity has its costs. Not to worry: no one dies in ���Ponyo�۝ or even coughs. Its sting is so gentle you might miss it. But when the ocean rises in this wonderful movie each leaping wave stares out at us with a baleful eye as if in watchful and worried wait."

notwithstanding the occasional humanist fable like ���E.T. �۝ all those movies and television programs have been inculcating a potentially toxic form of interplanetary prejudice?" �۝ a smart swift new film from the South African director Neill Blomkamp (who now lives in Canada and who wrote the screenplay with Terri Tatchell) raises such a possibility in part by inverting an axiomatic question of the U.F.O. genre. In place of the usual mystery ��� what are they going to do to us? ��� this movie poses a different kind of hypothetical puzzle. What would we do to them? The answer derived from intimate knowledge of how we have treated one another for centuries is not pretty." disturbingly plausible scenario. Back in the 1980s a giant spacecraft stalled in the skies over Johannesburg. On board were a large number of starving and disoriented creatures who were rescued and placed in a temporary refugee camp in the part of the city that gives the film its title. Over the next 20 years the settlement became a teeming shantytown like so many others in the developing world with the relatively minor distinction of being home to tall skinny bipeds with insectlike faces and bodies that seem to combine biological and mechanical features. Though there is evidence that those extraterrestrials ��� known in derogatory slang as prawns because of their vaguely crustacean appearance ��� represent an advanced civilization their lives on Earth are marked by squalor and dysfunction. And they are viewed by South Africans of all races with suspicion occasional pity and xenophobic hostility." but they hardly need to be. And the film�۪s implications extend far beyond the boundaries of a particular nation which is taken as more or less representative of the planet as a whole." from the mostly white soldiers and bureaucrats who corral and abuse the prawns to the Nigerian gangsters who prey upon the aliens and exploit their addiction to cat food is innocent. And casual bigotry turns out to be the least of the problems facing the exiles. As it progresses ���District 9�۝ uncovers a horrific program of medical experimentation yoked to a near-genocidal agenda of corporate greed. A company called M.N.U. (it stands none too subtly for Multi-National United) has taken over administration of the prawn population which means resettling the aliens in a remote enclosure reminiscent of the Bantustans of the apartheid era." a nervous nebbish whose father-in-law (Louis Minnaar) is the head of the company. Cowardly preening and hopeless at projecting authority Wikus is the kind of guy who gives nepotism a bad name. It says a lot about Mr. Blomkamp�۪s sense of humor and about his view of his own species that this pathetic little paper pusher is his chosen agent of mankind�۪s potential moral redemption." and perhaps overselling the allegory. Not that the metaphorical resonances of ���District 9�۝ aren�۪t rich and thought provoking. But the filmmakers don�۪t draw them out with a heavy didactic hand. Instead in the best B-movie tradition they embed their ideas in an ingenious propulsive and suspenseful genre entertainment one that respects your intelligence even as it makes your eyes pop (and once in a while your stomach turn)." which uses footage that pretends to have been harvested from news choppers and security cameras as well as some by the unseen crew accompanying Wikus on his tour of the prawn camp fades away after a while. The academic authorities do too having served the dual functions of providing narrative exposition and demonstrating the high-minded uselessness of official liberal discourse." we are at his side and under his skin and ���District 9�۝ subtly shifts from speculative science fiction to zombie bio-horror and then less subtly turns into an escape-action-chase movie full of explosions gunplay and vehicular mayhem." the tightness of the editing and the inventiveness of the special effects.

weepy stuff. Or you could think of it as a crazy story about a stalker who sweet-talks a little girl whom he later seduces when she�۪s a teenager only to then knock her up and emotionally psychologically and spiritually knock her down again and again as he hopscotches naked across the time-space continuum." which is why it�۪s easy to read Audrey Niffenegger�۪s chart-busting novel in such dramatically different ways. A chronological confusion it turns on a contemporary romance between an unwilling time traveler Henry and the woman he marries Clare. In the novel the romance comes across as airy and coy and unpersuasive. But what feels light on the page   can seem exceedingly ponderous once a filmmaker transposes those words into the visual realm. It is after all one thing to read about a naked guy talking up a 6-year-old girl while he�۪s hiding in some bushes. It�۪s another thing entirely to watch the big strapping healthy Eric Bana groping the greens." watching Mr. Bana frequently strut his seminude stuff nimbly avoiding the full-frontal reveal even as he flashes some discreet cheek is one of the few pleasures afforded by this often ridiculous awkward unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation. A sometime librarian Henry has been born with a genetic anomaly that causes him to take abrupt hops across time losing his clothes in the process. He first meets Clare (a frumped-up Rachel McAdams) when he�۪s 28 and she�۪s a 20-year-old art student. She�۪s new to Henry but she knows and adores him because he has been regularly visiting her since she was 6 popping in and out of her life though always when he was older. (Got that?)" the novel jumps all over the timeline and unfolds through alternating he-said she-said first-person voices. Notably it�۪s Henry who first describes an early crucial encounter between his 36-year-old self and the  self-possessed 6-year-old Clare which shrewdly puts you right inside his (innocent) head. First-person narration in novels can make you feel intensely close to a character as if you had crawled into another being. In the book you�۪re not only by Henry�۪s side when he�۪s hiding in those bushes: you�۪re also on his side or at least that�۪s the idea.

Mr. Page the Edge and Mr. White all honed their art in reaction to what they perceived as the dominant styles of the time." a peppy folk-inflected genre that ruled British pop in the 1950s. After a successful stint as a studio session prodigy he made his way to the Yardbirds and then to Led Zeppelin where his interest in the blues Eastern music and in the nuances of amplification reached full thundering fruition." growing up in the downtrodden Dublin of the 1970s discovered punk as an antidote to the bloated arena rock and fatuously shiny pop that saturated the airwaves. And Mr. White in 1980s Detroit wondered if hip-hop would permanently eclipse the instrumental sounds he cherished." and also to technology. Mr. White a traditionalist wary of digital effects and innovations is nonetheless as much given to tinkering as the Edge who finds lyricism in complicated sonic treatments and modifications or Mr. Page famous for playing a double-necked guitar and recording John Bonham�۪s drum parts in the echoey atrium of a big old house in the country." the lore in this documentary will be catnip.

We�۪re the only ones who can hear his question amid the shrieks of the customers and salesmen and the whir of a buzz saw that brings a guy on stilts and in an Uncle Sam costume down to size. From one angle this frenzied moment looks like a metaphor for the American auto industry but it�۪s just a throwaway in a comedy without a shred of obvious filmmaking and an endless stream of good bad sometimes terrible often absurd jokes." which is part of why the sight gag works. (They also look inherently funny especially when crawling among a crazed mob.) So who brought them? The filmmakers of course who as they do with everything else in this movie throw the bit against the wall but don�۪t wait to see if it sticks. Instead they race to the next joke and the one after that busily tossing one-liners surreal asides cheap and gross insults false apologies for such insults semi-naked ladies sex toys and multisyllabic expletives like confetti.

the fugitive teenage sweethearts in Gerardo Naranjo�۪s small jagged melodrama ���I�۪m Gonna Explode �۝ is palpable enough to make you squirm at the memory of being trapped in the limbo of early adolescence. Roman the neglected son of a Mexican government official in Guanajuato has grandiose outlaw fantasies of assassinating authority figures. Maru who is pretty in an unformed way latches on to Roman as the catalyst for which she has been waiting to give direction to her empty life. Put these two in a stolen car with a gun and they turn into Bonnie and Clyde with baby fat." sometimes confusing movie is a knowing homage to Jean-Luc Godard in particular to ���Pierrot le Fou.�۝ With its jerky hand-held camerawork zero attention span jarring shifts in narrative perspective and refusal to offer tidy explanations of who what where and when ���I�۪m Gonna Explode�۝ keeps you continually off balance. In the Godard manner it lives in the moment simultaneously taking you inside the bubble of Roman and Maru�۪s chaotic relationship and observing it with a shrugging detachment." whose mother died in a car crash when he was 13 (he keeps a family scrapbook he calls his ���album of gore�۝) is the son of Eugenio Valadez (Daniel Gim̩nez Cacho) a right-wing Mexican congressman who has remarried. He attracts Maru�۪s admiration with a high-school performance piece ���See You in Hell �۝ in which he pretends to hang himself." the sullen daughter of a nurse whose husband has run off to the United States pours her inchoate emotions into a diary. (The film�۪s title comes from an entry heard as a voice-over.) Together they conspire to stage a fake kidnapping in which Roman pretends to abduct her at gunpoint. Instead of fleeing Guanajuato they hide out in a tent on the rooftop of the Valadez home and revel in the brouhaha stirred up by their disappearance. Viewed through their eyes the grown-ups are buffoons who drink themselves into oblivion each night. When the police show the adults a mawkish video of official advice for the parents of missing children Maru�۪s mother Helena (Martha Claudia Moreno) bursts into tears." Roman and Maru steal downstairs for supplies and the rooftop becomes a cluttered picnic ground of empty wine bottles and electronic toys. Roman occasionally uses his cellphone to taunt the adults with false reports of the couple�۪s whereabouts. In one call he pretends that his car has crashed and that Maru is gravely injured." �۝ but they have a gawky first sexual encounter that is accidentally observed by Roman�۪s stepmother Eva (Rebecca Jones) who keeps silent. They eventually decide to flee to Mexico City. Their first stop is a birthday party for the 15-year-old daughter of a friend of Eugenio�۪s at which Roman becomes wildly drunk and violent."

�۝ a tender minimalist drama from the German director Andreas Dresen is a whistling-past-the-graveyard tale of two elderly  Berliners  taking a last chance at love." depending on how contemplative your mood and how much personal baggage you bring to the theater. Simply written to allow multiple assumptions of background and motivation the story (by Mr. Dresen and three collaborators) concerns Inge (Ursula Werner) a 67-year-old seamstress with soft features and a round pillowy body. We see quite a lot of that body almost immediately ��� even before the film�۪s opening credits ��� when Inge delivers a pair of pants to Karl (Horst Westphal) a cheery customer almost 10 years her senior. Within seconds Karl has approved the alterations removed the pants and most of Inge�۪s clothing besides." unforgiving daylight Karl and Inge go at it with wordless urgency and visible joy their eagerness tempered by neither flirting nor coyness. Facing the cinematic taboo of twilight-years nudity head-on and upfront Mr. Dresen and his actors create an atmosphere of reckless vulnerability that�۪s immediately compelling and artistically intriguing. We want to explore this relationship further." but there�۪s the not-so-small problem of Werner (Horst Rehberg) Inge�۪s husband of 30 years. Lanky and gentle and with an air of desiccated serenity Werner thinks  a fun night in is listening to vinyl recordings of steam engines. (He can name every model.) His love of locomotives however is no barrier to the couple�۪s fond intimacy and contented sex life; so when Karl comes calling Inge fights the attraction even though she knows ��� as  the audience does ��� that an adulterous montage of picnics and skinny-dipping is probably only a scene or two away." using insistent close-ups and precisely calibrated framing ���Cloud 9�۝ augments its modest narrative with unguarded performances and visual lucidity. Maneuvering around Inge and Werner�۪s cramped apartment Michael Hammon�۪s camera patiently observes the quotidian rhythms of the long-married. Only in the throes of the affair as the lovers cycle along bucolic lanes and run giggling through a rain shower does the film lighten and expand; it�۪s as though we�۪re seeing color through Inge�۪s eyes and breathing air through her lungs." ���Cloud 9�۝ never becomes morbid. ���Just enjoy it �۝ Inge�۪s married daughter (Steffi K�_hnert) counsels when her mother confesses the affair. Even the ladies in the choir to which Inge belongs seem to notice and approve her new coquettish glow. But the film is most perceptive when telegraphing the subtle transformations of Inge�۪s marriage relying on Mr. Rehberg�۪s marvelously contained acting to deflect melodrama. Their union feels real in a way that�۪s all too rare in modern movies." then when what has been a celebration of last-ditch passion slides abruptly into a cautionary tale. Until that point the movie�۪s refreshingly unbiased tone allows us to make our own moral judgments teasing us with the possibility that occasionally the scarlet woman can escape unbranded. I for one was rooting for her."

Mr. Li a Chinese-born filmmaker who has lived in Japan for much of the past 20 years intersperses visits with Mr. Kariya throughout this long engrossing documentary; the swords this venerable craftsman makes are beautiful and the skill and tradition that go into their manufacture are inspiring." contentious and often horrific history. Already controversial in Japan the film explores that country�۪s legacy of militaristic nationalism illuminating both the noble customs and the brutality entwined at its heart. ���Yasukuni�۝ refers to a Tokyo shrine built in 1869 and consecrated to the memory of soldiers who have died in Japan�۪s wars. Their souls are said to reside within the gates of this Shinto  shrine. Its name means peaceful country though its place in Japanese consciousness suggests the opposite." Mr. Li�۪s oblique cin̩ma v̩rit̩ approach may be a little confusing at first. But the absence of narration or an expressed directorial point of view is central to the film�۪s achievement which is to address a passionately contested snarl of issues with a calm nuanced ethical curiosity. Both the defenders of Japanese imperial glory and the victims of Japanese expansionist barbarism are heard. And while Japanese conservatives were outraged by the film when it was released last year Mr. Li�۪s patience with their side�۪s view might also cause queasiness among those who wish for more overt expressions of candor contrition and indignation about Japan�۪s conduct during World War II." China;  Manchuria;  and nearly every Asian territory held by Japan in its bloody wars of conquest in the 1930s and �۪40s. The prime minister at the time Junichiro Koizumi visited Yasukuni in 2005 on the anniversary of Japan�۪s surrender to the Allies. His pilgrimage incited international outrage especially in China and the most arresting scenes in Mr. Li�۪s film are of Mr. Koizumi�۪s supporters protesting against the protest." he sidles up to arguments and speeches and uncovers a disturbing discourse. Bland sentimental expressions of patriotism and reverence for fallen soldiers slides quickly into revanchism denial and an ugly xenophobic nationalism. Kindly grandmothers collect signatures for a petition ���refuting�۝ the massacre known as the Rape of Nanking and a mob chases and beats two young men daring to raise placards against militarism. Rather than confront  the assailants the police take the young men into custody." those requests are always denied. We also learn that swords of the type Mr. Kariya makes are not merely ornamental weapons. They were also featured in beheading contests widely reported in the wartime press in which the numbers of Chinese prisoners executed by dashing young officers were reported like golf scores." a strategy that is both integral to the art of ���Yasukuni�۝ and also something of a limitation. But if the film does not provide a full explanation of its subject��� as an English-language reader might find in ���The Wages of Guilt �۝ Ian Buruma�۪s superb comparative study of memory and accountability in postwar Germany and Japan ��� it does provide a haunting meditation on the power and ambiguity of the past.

Five credited writers came up with this jumble and two editors chopped it all up into itty-bitty pieces before throwing it at the screen." an insult to the art of the likes of Winsor McCay and Chris Ware.

Adapted from Zulfu Livaneli�۪s 2002 novel it observes the collision of two cultures one ancient the other modern in contemporary Turkey. Directed and produced by Abdullah Oguz ���Bliss�۝ has ravishing cinematography by Mirsad Herovic and a mystical score by Mr. Livaneli that match the novel�۪s feverish poetic language. The natural beauty of the waters around Istanbul is breathtaking. And once the story moves from the Anatolian village where Meryem�۪s unconscious brutalized body is discovered by a shepherd the movie�۪s initially monochromatic palette bursts into brilliant color." the film focuses on Meryem�۪s steady awakening to her own autonomy. After fitting a noose around her neck Meryem (Ozgu Namal) removes it and refuses to kill herself as tradition dictates. Her stern uncle Ali Riza (Mustafa Avkiran) the dignitary in the rural village who decreed her suicide decides to wait for his  son Cemal (Murat Han) to kill her when he returns from the army. Cemal�۪s instructions are to take Meryem his cousin to Istanbul on the pretext of an arranged marriage and dispose of her en route." whom he routinely reviles as a whore and smacks in the face at any suggestion of what he deems improper female behavior conflicts with his fundamentalist beliefs. In one scene he calls her a demon after having an erotic dream about her. But he can also be tenderly protective." where they visit his brother Yakup (Erol Babaoglu) who disparages the village�۪s benighted customs. Still feeling obliged to follow orders Cemal takes Meryem to a bridge and instructs her to jump.

Irfan has his own demons: his dream is to find a way of living in which he doesn�۪t have to think about tomorrow." with its bikinied young women who drop by from other boats Meryem chafes at Cemal�۪s dominance.

�۝ Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her editor Judith Jones (Erin Dilly) struggle to come up with a title for the  culinary doorstopper Julia has spent the past eight years composing. It�۪s not an especially suspenseful moment ��� pretty much anyone who has cooked an omelet knows what the book is called ��� but it gives Ms. Ephron and the audience a chance to savor the precise nature of Julia Child�۪s achievement." �۝ but ���Mastering the Art.�۝ In other words cooking that omelet is part of a demanding exalted discipline not to be entered into frivolously or casually. But at the same time: You can do it. It is a matter of technique of skill of practice." �۝ and of Child�۪s subsequent television career (which is mostly tangential to the movie�۪s concerns) is hard to overstate. The book stands with a few other postwar touchstones ��� including Dr. Benjamin Spock�۪s ���Baby and Child Care �۝ the Kinsey Report and Dr. Seuss�۪s ���Cat in the Hat�۝  ���  as a publication that fundamentally altered the way a basic human activity was perceived and pursued." busy movie traffics in such sweeping historical ideas except occasionally by implication. Nor does she infuse the happy well-fed life of her Julia (the main source for whom  is a memoir Child wrote with Alex Prud�۪homme her great-nephew) with too much grand drama. ���Julie & Julia�۝ proceeds with such ease and charm that its audacity ��� a no-nonsense plucky self-confidence embodied by the indomitable Julia herself ��� is easy to miss." this is a Hollywood movie about women that is not about the desperate pursuit of men. Marriage is certainly the context both of Julia�۪s story and of Julie�۪s (about whom more in a moment) but it is not the point. The point to invoke the title of a book whose author has an amusing cameo here (played by Frances Sternhagen) is the joy of cooking." ���Mastering the Art�۝ is better known simply as ���Julia �۝ and many a kitchen debate has been settled by an appeal to its authority. Should we separate the eggs? Turn the roast? What does Julia say?" more than half a century after Julia and her husband Paul arrived in France ��� a debarkation that provides the movie�۪s opening scene  ���  a young woman named Julie Powell decided to answer that question in the most literal and systematic way imaginable. A would-be writer working at a thankless office job and living with her husband in Long Island City Queens Ms. Powell spent a year cooking every single recipe in ���Mastering the Art�۝ and writing a blog about the experience. The blog led to the memoir that provided Ms. Ephron�۪s movie with its title and the lesser half of its narrative." Ms. Ephron�۪s script emphasizes the parallels between the lives of her leading characters who never meet. (They appear on screen together only when Julie watches Julia on television). Julie (Amy Adams) and Julia have loving supportive husbands ��� the affable Chris Messina is Eric Powell; the impeccable Stanley Tucci is Paul Child ��� who only occasionally express impatience with their wives�۪ gastronomic obsessions. (Paul by arching an eyebrow Eric by storming out of the apartment.)" �۝ Julia exclaims ��� and both pursue it in the service of a latent but powerful ambition. Publishing success is the happy ending to both tales and Ms. Ephron a literary and journalistic star before she was a filmmaker is unequivocal in her celebration of the joys of such triumph." in an early scene is humiliated by a table full of college friends who flaunt their BlackBerrys assistants real estate deals and lucrative glossy-magazine gigs. But by means of failed aspics and triumphant sauces Julie shows them all up. And Julia similarly overcomes the xenophobia and sexism of the French culinary establishment and the myopia of an American publisher and becomes the person we know as Julia Child." though she has the rounded shoulders and the fluting voice down perfectly." familiar people they overshadow the originals so that for example you can�۪t think of Ray Charles without seeing Jamie Foxx or Truman Capote without envisioning Philip Seymour Hoffman. But Ms. Streep�۪s incarnation of Julia Child has the opposite effect making the real Julia who died in 2004 more vivid more alive than ever." as in ���The Devil Wears Prada �۝ a perfect foil. Like the character he plays he is gallant and self-assured and able to assert a strong sense of his own presence even as he happily cedes the center of attention. Together their mastery of the art is so perfect that even quiet transitional scenes between them are delightful. (And when Jane Lynch shows up as Dorothy Julia�۪s sister the delight ascends to an almost indecent level of giddiness)." I thought to myself at one point as in a state of rapture I watched them sit still on a couch looking off into space." you can�۪t help missing them. Ms. Adams is a lovely and subtle performer but she is overmatched by her co-star and handicapped by the material. Julia Child could whip up a navarin of lamb for lunch but Meryl Streep eats young actresses for breakfast. Remember Anne Hathaway in ���The Devil Wears Prada�۝? Amanda Seyfried in ���Mamma Mia!�۝? Neither do I." and by a corresponding imbalance in Ms. Ephron�۪s interest in the characters. The conceit of parallel lives is undone by the movie�۪s condescending treatment of Julie and also by its ardent embrace of the past at the expense of the present." Paris in the late �۪40s and early �۪50s is ��� well it�۪s postwar Paris a dream world of fabulous clothes architecture sex food cigarettes and political intrigue. And New York in 2002 is made a little unfairly to seem drab and soulless by comparison. Queens demographically the most cosmopolitan of the five boroughs and something of a foodie mecca is treated with easy Manhattanite disdain as a punch line and punching bag." really. It arises from an inherent flaw in the film�۪s premise. Julie is an insecure enterprising young woman who found a gimmick and scored a book contract. Julia is a figure of such imposing cultural stature that her pots and pans are displayed at the Smithsonian. The fact that Ms. Ephron like Julie herself is well aware of this gap does not prevent the film from falling into it. All the filmmaker�۪s artful whisking can�۪t quite achieve the light fluffy emulsion she is trying for." and the pleasures offered by this movie should not be disdained. Julia Child knew what to do with a broken sauce or a half-fallen souffl̩:  serve it anyway with flair and without apology. What would Julia say? What she always said: Bon app̩tit!" and the indulgence ��� in exquisite moderation ��� of a few choice vices." and ���Julie & Julia�۝ by Julie Powell; director of photography Stephen Goldblatt; edited by Richard Marks; music by Alexandre Desplat; production designer Mark Ricker; produced by Ms. Ephron Laurence Mark Amy Robinson and Eric Steel; released by Columbia Pictures.

The eccentrically matched Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich play Cliff and Cydney who after loading up on gear head off on a long hike toward a remote stretch of paradisiacal beach. As the blue blue ocean spreads out below them they hug a coastal trail trading alohas with other hikers including Nick (Timothy Olyphant) a hard body with a sly smile and a long blade strapped to one calf.

Nick casting glances at Cliff seizes on this information and it soon becomes a wedge between the writer and the warrior the nominal geek and the anointed brute. You need a new story Nick lectures Cliff before plunging into a mildly comic meta-discourse on what makes a good thriller.

it�۪s the actor Paul Giamatti. With his doubting eyes and gently defeated posture he tends to come across as a man carrying a burden though one not necessarily or wholly of his making. You can almost see the distress resting heavy and hard on his sloped shoulders pushing out against his ovoid head tugging at his lower eyelids and worrying his lips." �۝ a story about life�۪s anguished weight Mr. Giamatti plays a role for which he is exceptionally perhaps even uniquely qualified: an actor named Paul Giamatti thereafter known as Paul. When the movie opens Paul is rehearsing a scene from Chekhov�۪s ���Uncle Vanya�۝ with obvious effort and concentration. ���I�۪m a madman �۝ he proclaims. ���I�۪m 47 years old.�۝ It�۪s the final act of the play and Uncle Vanya is loudly expressing his vast disappointment. If only he continues (and here the translation differs from other versions) ���If I could only live what�۪s left in a different way.�۝ In the play the next voice is that of his friend a doctor who with palpable irritation tells Vanya to shut it." though is Paul himself who angrily cuts off the rehearsal. ���Uncle Vanya�۝ is among other things about disappointed lives and thwarted desires and the continuing performances we call our lives. In many respects the same holds true for ���Cold Souls �۝ an ambitious elegantly shot tonally cool first feature written and directed by Sophie Barthes that shows hints of Stanley Kubrick and Charlie Kaufman both. Yet unlike Vanya the on-screen character called Paul Giamatti who may or may not be similar to the public figure �� the versatile heroically ordinary-looking actor  from films like ���Sideways�۝ and the HBO series ���John Adams�۝ �� doesn�۪t appear to have much to regret." Claire (Emily Watson). He has an agent who phones him rather than the reverse. And he�۪s playing Uncle Vanya in a New York production a plum gig. But something is troubling Paul gnawing at him and eroding his performance or so he believes. It�۪s not a tragedy the theater director (Michael Tucker) kindly reminds him after Paul brings rehearsals to an abrupt angrily frustrated stop. Yet the play isn�۪t a comedy either.  It�۪s something in between something like life a blurring that thwarts Paul. His already rounded shoulders and bent head droop even further. And then he does something that every artist should be wary of: he listens to his agent." a company that extracts and stores souls and on the conveniently close Roosevelt Island no less. It�۪s a preposterous hook of course but Ms. Barthes introduces her absurd premise with deadpan restraint. In this she has great help from the dryly funny David Strathairn as Dr. Flintstein who runs the company with his assistant Stephanie (an underused decorative Lauren Ambrose). With little ado Dr. Flintstein persuades Paul to relinquish his soul in a swift painless process that extracts it as if it were a zit. Afterward Paul is horrified to discover that his soul looks �� and as he rattles it inside its glass container sounds �� exactly like a chickpea." essential inescapable: ���We must go on living �۝ a character  says with wrenching finality. Ms. Barthes more or less comes to the same conclusion but she complicates her film in ways that suggest she has trouble accepting such a seemingly modest (say chickpea-size) conclusion. And so early on she introduces Paul�۪s narrative counterpart Nina (Dina Korzun) a beautiful melancholic who smuggles black-market Russian souls into the United States. Like Paul Nina is a performer (she passes through immigration using  counterfeit fingerprints) and overburdened with soul in this case the traces of smuggled souls that linger in her memory like the flickering images from barely remembered old movies." Paul and Nina eventually meet in person. There is much to admire in their scenes together particularly after Paul�۪s soul has gone amusingly if not tragically missing in Russia. There he finds a soap-opera star who yearns for the soul of Al Pacino (a very good Katheryn Winnick) and witnesses desperate people selling the most intimate part of their being. He also looks into his own soul and while it brings tears to his eyes it much like the Russian subplot proves disappointingly banal which might be true to life but is an artistic letdown. In this attractive smart-enough finally un-brave movie Ms. Barthes peeks at the dark comedy of the soul only to beat a quick pre-emptive retreat."

A ferocious talent Mr. Seidl made documentaries before turning to fiction in 2001 with his first feature ���Dog Days.�۝ Set against a summer heat wave ���Dog Days�۝ offers a look simultaneously comic and tragic at numerous unconnected (or disconnected) men and women engaged in banal and perverse pastimes. A woman dances on a table seemingly oblivious to the man looking up her skirt; elsewhere a man bakes under the hot sun his swollen belly as stuffed as the ubiquitous sausage that serves as a blunt visual trope."

Even so ���Import Export�۝ was jeered at Cannes at its first press screening (not an unusual occurrence for good films and bad) yet much of the criticism I heard had little to do with Mr. Seidl�۪s filmmaking. Rather the movie rightly made people uncomfortable." there are two separate nodal points in ���Import Export �۝ which was shot in real places with real people.  That woman trudging  through the snow is Olga (Ekateryna Rak) a young single Ukrainian mother who works in a hospital where her pay is habitually shortchanged (���Thirty percent?�۝ she asks) and the peeling walls look as if they haven�۪t been painted since the Brezhnev era. The devastating costs of the collapse of the Soviet Union haunt every image: it�۪s a failure made visible by the large  military jet  on display in front of a decrepit apartment block and in the opening shot of a man trying and repeatedly failing to start a motorcycle. No one is going anywhere though Olga will soon try leaving her baby and mother for a job abroad." including an ugly stint at an Internet live-sex operation where women indifferently wag their rears at computer monitors for demanding disembodied clients Olga boards a train for Austria. Hers is the import part of the story. The export part intercut throughout involves Paul  (Paul Hofmann) a fitfully employed young Austrian with no evident prospects who eventually lands in Ukraine. Neither Olga nor Paul say much ��� like everyone in the cast the two leads are also nonprofessionals ��� but their mirrored struggle to find work and the humiliations they endure to keep their jobs and make their way amid so much crushing indifference are intensely expressive. This isn�۪t the familiar middle-class search for meaningful personally fulfilling work: it�۪s a fight for dignity." taking you places rarely seen in fiction films like the ghastly row of derelict-looking East European  apartment blocks where segregated Roma families (Gypsies in the more familiar parlance) live in unspeakable filth. There during a misguided visit along with his stepfather (Michael Thomas) where he is offered young women in exchange for money Paul is almost done in by the inhabitants who throng around the two men�۪s  van pressing and even flinging themselves against the fast-escaping  vehicle. It�۪s a vivid resonant metaphor for a film that restlessly measures the distances ��� economic cultural and psychological ��� between Western and Eastern Europe." but there is more to movies than  escapism. That might seem obvious or at least might have in the past when the American movie market made far more room for nominally difficult work for films that expand your aesthetic horizons test your patience challenge your assumptions provoke enrage and inspire you to moral argument. Mr. Seidl offers little in the way  of cinematic palliatives. Yet while he�۪s serious he�۪s also funny with a sense of humor that skews Beckettian. (A scene in a geriatric hospital ends on a bleak if poetic note worthy of ���Waiting for Godot.�۝) He is unlike many others embracing the world not in retreat."

Belgian brothers whose highly recognizable frequently imitated style has won them recognition nearly everywhere in the world. A predictable but unfortunate exception is the United States where the audience for  challenging movies from other countries seems to shrink by the month. Mention of the Dardennes which elsewhere might elicit a nod of the head is here more likely to be met with furrowed brows." fixtures of the Cannes Film Festival (where two ���Rosetta�۝ and ���The Child �۝ have won the top prize in 1999 and 2005) are similar enough in method and mood that ���Lorna�۪s Silence�۝ is as good a place as any to make or renew their acquaintance. Its setting is a rough industrial city in the gritty Francophone part of Belgium ���  Li̬ge in this case rather than Seraing the Dardennes�۪ hometown. Their preferred social milieu is still the gray zone between the traditional proletariat and a new underclass that includes immigrants petty criminals and hard-pressed respectable workers trying to maintain a sense of decency and continuity in their lives." ���Lorna�۪s Silence�۝ has no musical soundtrack and an abundance of rough ground-level close-up camerawork. But if the Dardennes are realists they are also moralists. They compose fables of ethical difficulty with religious overtones that seem to grow more explicit with each new movie. ���The Son�۝ (2002) carried Christian implications in its title its theme of forgiveness and the vocation of its protagonist a teacher of carpentry. ���Lorna�۪s Silence �۝ with a narrative that turns partly on a mysterious pregnancy evokes subtly but unmistakably a range of maternal biblical associations not limited to the tale of the Nativity." the atmosphere is dominated by the harsh materialism of the modern cash economy. Everything is for sale: sex honor dignity life. Lorna (Arta Dobroshi) an Albanian immigrant has a menial more or less legitimate job in dry cleaning but she is also ensnared in a shady underground cash nexus. Her boyfriend Sokol (Alban Ukaj) is an itinerant worker who comes to see her when his travels permit.  Lorna has secured legal residency in Belgium through her sham marriage to a drug addict named Claudy (J̩r̩mie Renier)." to which Lorna agrees is to help Claudy overdose but he complicates matters by starting under her influence to clean up his act. Lorna�۪s predicament is thus stark and brutal: a practical dilemma that is also a spiritual crisis. She is pinned between financial debt and human obligation and trapped by a combination of self-interest fear and highly inconvenient compassion." and a quiet outrage at the pitiless aspects of capitalism the Dardennes are hardly determinists. Like the young thief played by Mr. Renier in ���The Child�۝ or the factory worker in ���Rosetta �۝ Lorna is at once a victim of circumstance and a free agent. Impossible situations do not remove the necessity of individual choice and Lorna is worth caring about not because she is an emblem of innocent suffering but because she is stubborn willful and capable of taking action." with a wary diffident pout that conveys both fragility and ruthless decisiveness is not someone you will soon forget. There is nothing abstract about Lorna�۪s plight even if it can also be taken as a symbol of the alienation and degradation that threaten millions in a postindustrial globalized economic order. Her humanity makes her abrasive and off-putting as well as pitiable and potentially tragic." which may be just another way of saying it�۪s a film by the Dardenne brothers. If it falls a bit short of the standards of their best work that is only because it is not quite a masterpiece. At least three of their other nondocumentary features come close to that status ��� ���Rosetta �۝ ���The Son�۝ and ���The Child�۝��� and that is partly because their literary and narrative conceits are almost completely absorbed into their presentation of life as it happens. These films seem when you first encounter them like facts with the adamantine gravity of stones or trees and only later does an appreciation of their careful crafty artifice seep in." �۝ in contrast seems from the outset more determined more plot driven more written. The Dardennes�۪ other films have won prizes for acting and overall excellence at Cannes but this one was singled out last year for its screenplay which is very good but which is also perhaps too much in evidence. Every fictional character of course is controlled by an external force but in this case the reversals and surprises in the narrative undermine our crucial sense of Lorna�۪s autonomy and of her solitude." and ���Lorna�۪s Silence�۝ is precisely because of its limitations a more accessible and less austere experience than ���Rosetta�۝ or ���The Son.�۝ It�۪s the closest thing to a crowd pleaser that these rigorous demanding and profoundly humane artists are likely to make." nudity violence and drug use." Alain Marcoen; edited by Marie-H̩l̬ne Dozo; production designer Igor Gabriel; produced by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne and Denis Freyd; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

His soothing tones however can�۪t disguise a relish for the fray: beneath the silver-fox exterior beats a rabble-rousing heart. (���You try to do the story legally �۝ he insists eyes twinkling in remembrance of every cloak-and-dagger move.) That heart invigorates every frame of ���The Cove �۝ as does Mr. Psihoyos�۪s eye for a powerful image (his photographs have graced many an issue of National Geographic) and savvy narrative style: this is no angry enviro-rant but a living breathing movie whose horrifying  disclosures feel fully earned." we watch as Mr. Psihoyos recruits his dream team �� including a former avionics engineer with the Canadian Air Force and a pair of champion free divers �� and turns it loose. Planting ingeniously camouflaged state-of-the-art equipment in and around their target they capture sights and sounds of uncommon beauty and quiet revelation: a group of fishermen reminiscing about blue-whale pods as dense as ���a clump of bamboo�۝ and a ghostly thermal handprint clinging to a gatepost like arcane spoor. Viewed from below the hypnotically graceful progress of a free diver resembles nothing so much as an undulating mermaid with a giant can opener for a tail �� an inadvertent clue to the movie�۪s intentions." the movie�۪s many interviews and interests (ranging from dolphin-human relations to the mystery of where all that slaughtered meat ends up) interweave seamlessly. And if the film�۪s villains are sometimes difficult to untangle it could be because one of them the worldwide marine-park industry is not formally represented; it could also be because without our patronage that industry would not exist." however are instantly identifiable like the shy Japanese councilmen who risk their jobs to protect schoolchildren from mercury-tainted  dolphin meat. But ���The Cove �۝ like the dolphins would be lost without Richard O�۪Barry who captured and trained all five of the animals who made Flipper a television star and a household name and sparked the craze for performing sea mammals. His drooping eyes and sagging shoulders testify to the bone-deep exhaustion of someone who has spent the last 35 years atoning and when he gate-crashes a meeting of the International Whaling Commission the video screen strapped to his chest is like a physical manifestation of decades of guilt." my phone rings �۝ he says. (We don�۪t need to be told that his heart breaks.) You may not give a fig for dolphins but Mr. O�۪Barry is giving enough for us all." Japan it was under cover of documenting the degradation of ocean reefs. Once there however he proceeded to mount one of the most audacious and perilous operations in the history of the conservation movement." the movie is a Trojan horse: an exceptionally well-made documentary that unfolds like a spy thriller complete with bugged hotel rooms clandestine derring-do and mysterious men in gray flannel suits. Those men �� perhaps cops perhaps worse �� tail Mr. Psihoyos and his crew unrelentingly determined to prevent anyone from filming the enormously lucrative dolphin capture and slaughter that support the town�۪s economy and employ  its fishermen." as we shall see the methods used  are so nonchalantly brutal and gut-churningly primitive that Taiji officials are understandably publicity-shy. (And we learn later there are other secrets lurking beneath the town�۪s thriving tourist industry and cute dolphin-shape pleasure boats.) Consequently anyone straying too close to the kill zone �� a secluded lagoon protected by steep cliffs manned tunnels and razor-wire gates �� is violently harassed by videocam-wielding fishermen hoping to record an imprisonable offense."

the hero of Park Chan-wook�۪s ���Thirst �۝ is many different things: a Roman Catholic priest; a selfless volunteer in a dangerous medical experiment; a reluctant faith healer with a cult following; a vampire. And ���Thirst�۝ itself which won the Jury Prize this year at the  Cannes Film Festival where Mr. Park has long been a favorite is equally protean. It is a bloodstained horror movie a dark comedy a noirish psychodrama of crime and punishment a melodrama of mad love a freehanded literary adaptation (of ��mile Zola�۪s ���Th̩r̬se Raquin�۝) and of course a vampire movie." it is also less than the sum of its parts ��� overly long lacking in narrative momentum and too often choosing sensation over coherence. Mr. Park has an undeniable knack for choreographing bloody sensual set pieces. While nothing in ���Thirst�۝ is quite as shocking or perverse as some of the best-known moments in his ���Old Boy�۝ or ���Lady Vengeance�۝ ��� by which I mean that no children are murdered and no live cephalopods swallowed whole ��� there are elegantly presented servings of sex and gore. Mr. Park and his cast offer moments of creepy winking humor and also of intense emotion a combination that is a hallmark of this director�۪s oeuvre." suggested by the film�۪s title is desire: for human blood for sexual release and also for something purer and more soothing. Sang-hyun despite his vampirism (which follows his voluntary infection with a disfiguring tropical virus) clings to a sense of righteousness and decency. Instead of  maiming or killing innocent people he discreetly slurps from the intravenous tube of an overweight patient in a hospital coma ward. Later on when his appetite (and that of his lover) grows Sang-hyun proposes turning to assisted suicide rather than outright murder. Even his sexual hunger is shadowed by guilt and colored by tenderness as much as lust." one of South Korea�۪s most inventive and reliably sympathetic actors. More somber and stiffer than he was in Bong Joon-ho�۪s ���Host �۝  one of the best monster-horror movies of recent years Mr. Song broods and suffers persuasively. He also slyly signals some of the more preposterous aspects of his character. This poor priest longing to help humanity finds himself covered in blisters and under quarantine and then subject to sensory freakouts that are scant compensation for his superhuman powers." and his sound design foregrounds wet intimate icky noises. He is a virtuoso not so much of sex and violence as of the feverish states that incite such frenzies of carnality. In Sang-hyun�۪s case involuntary bloodlust is redoubled by a more familiar kind when he finds himself infatuated with a young woman Tae-ju (Kim Ok-vin). The adoptive stepsister and now the wife of a sickly childhood friend of  Sang-hyun�۪s Tae-ju lives with her husband (Shin Ha-kyun) and mother-in-law (Kim Hae-sook) in a state of Cinderella-like servitude. She is bored bossed around and she leads Sang-hyun to believe grievously abused." and sometimes is a nasty little drama of mayhem revenge and remorse. Ms. Kim at first the very image of girlish frailty evolves from ing̩nue to femme fatale to demon and exerts herself bravely in an effort to embody the film�۪s anxious and confused ideas about female sexuality." from ���Twilight�۝ to ���True Blood.�۝  Tae-ju who is initiated by Sang-hyun  into his sanguinary tribe is at once a helpless victim and a wanton vixen. The difference between the lovers is indicative of the film�۪s queasy quasi-misogynist ideas about eros and ethics. Sang-hyun  is morally stricken by his cravings and when he can�۪t fight them he at least tries to bargain with their implacable demands. Tae-ju once she overcomes her initial shyness recognizes no such scruples or boundaries. She is a fantasy figure designed to scare and titillate boys who imagine that a sexually awakened woman is an uncontrollably destructive force." this fantasy has the potential to be more interesting than it is.

whether the joke is on the funnyman with the  pie in the kisser or the woman trying really  trying to fall for the  schnook who didn�۪t use the condom. ���Funny People �۝ the latest from Judd Apatow the  director  of the hit comedies ���Knocked Up�۝ and ���The 40-Year-Old Virgin�۝ and  a prolific producer is being pitched as a bid at gravity earnestness adulthood whatever. It�۪s  an angle that sounds as if it had been cooked up by a studio flack to explain how words like divorce and death got tangled in with all the penis (and thereabouts) jokes. But the only difference is that now  Mr. Apatow  also seems lethally serious about  being Judd Apatow." �۝ which he wrote and directed stars Adam Sandler as George Simmons a onetime stand-up nobody who has become fantastically successful by starring in the kind of crummy high-concept Hollywood comedies ��� in one he plays an adult with the body of a baby ��� that have been the creative ruin of Eddie Murphy." George learns that he has a rare almost certainly fatal blood disease. Shaken up he returns home and watches images of himself on five television screens  in his mansion a nice touch for any professional narcissist. He also pursues an experimental treatment and hires an assistant a fledgling Los Angeles stand-up Ira (Seth Rogen)." often unsettling give and take between the famous and the not famous which in Hollywood terms means the powerful and the weak. Ira is flattered by the attention but he�۪s hungry too. He wants a piece of the other man�۪s show-business action which as is evident in one pathetic scene of two hot numbers turned on by George�۪s fame is the only action he has hopes of getting." he might not service his boss sexually like those two eager stargazers ��� I have a boyfriend one woman announces to Ira right before heading off with George ��� but he nonetheless assumes the assistant�۪s requisite submissive position." who has blown up professionally and slimmed down physically since his breakout role in ���Knocked Up�۝ two years ago makes a cute puppy. He tags after George loyally wagging his tail and begging for scraps which is what he receives. When he writes jokes for George�۪s appearance at a MySpace corporate event he earns  $1 000 as his headlining boss pockets the $299 000 balance. Like the backstage scenes of stand-up comics anxiously swapping phony compliments and phonier insults the MySpace scene conveys the surreality of the celebrity circuit in which name personalities are trotted out for pricey dog and pony entertainment. (MySpace sponsored a contest where the prize was a walk-on role in the movie.)" with their bad lighting and air of flop-sweat have the sting of truth. But they are also disappointingly brief while the onstage routines with the exception of one of Ira�۪s bits about being a polite womanizer are neither especially funny nor memorable. The deep rituals of the comedy circuit aren�۪t really the point here as becomes clear as Mr. Apatow forges into increasingly sticky territory lavishing time on George�۪s contrition tour as he unconvincingly mends fences with his estranged family and socializes with equal opportunity comedy offenders like Sarah Silverman and Norm Macdonald. (Eminem as himself trumps those jokers by threatening to beat up the real Ray Romano.) Then George reaches out to an old lover the laughs give way to tears and this promising comedy bloats sags and dies." Laura is played by Mr. Apatow�۪s wife Leslie Mann a brittle lightweight comic talent who giggles and flutters right on cue widening her eyes at George with obligatory adoration. She�۪s fine but the gushy romance she brings with her is a drag. As is true of almost all the female characters in Mr. Apatow�۪s movies Laura�۪s role is to help George grow up to get out of both his own head and insular masculine world. Yet while this dynamic worked in ���The 40-Year-Old Virgin�۝ and to a lesser extent in ���Knocked Up �۝ in this movie the romantic complications are primarily situational: she�۪s married.  Honor rather than George�۪s ego (it isn�۪t in remission) stands in their way which gives him  ��� and Mr. Apatow  ��� an easy out." he is undeniably a star the movie�۪s biggest draw and its most effective and powerful presence. It�۪s easy to buy him as both a selfish jerk and a maudlin self-pitier whether George is weeping alone into his designer sheets or confiding some  medical news to his housekeeper the only sympathetic ear around. With his flatline  drone stand-and-deliver gestural performance and prickliness Mr. Sandler is effortlessly charmless and in his performance you see the  risky movie this might have been if Mr. Apatow had pushed harder." �۝ which explains why though it glances on the perils of fame it mostly affirms its pleasures. Part of this stems from the autobiographical touches. George doesn�۪t double for Mr. Apatow though  the filmmaker�۪s  sympathies keep the character on the safe side. But this is Mr. Apatow�۪s world his friends his wife. His and Ms. Mann�۪s daughters even play Laura�۪s children. If the fear of death haunts George only  briefly it isn�۪t only  because his disease  goes on hiatus it�۪s also because Mr. Apatow  seems to have become uncomfortable with or perhaps immune to the messiness of life. This he seems   to be saying is as good as it gets and man is it ever good. He�۪s sentimentalized himself." I suppose but nice can be murder on comedy and drama alike. (Comedy is a man in trouble not a man at peace with himself.) It�۪s telling that when Mr. Apatow isn�۪t trying to get in touch with George�۪s (gentler kinder) feelings the movie pleasurably pops. The scenes for instance of Ira and his greedily ambitious friends the globular Leo (Jonah Hill) and ramrod-straight Mark (Jason Schwartzman) who together form a walking talking exclamation point have a lightness of touch and palpable warmth. They�۪re also seamlessly easily comic because of the push-pull between the friends�۪ ambition and camaraderie their hopes for one another and their competitive ruthlessness.

���Fragments�۝ examines the aftermath of a massacre. At the center of its multistranded story  are five survivors who follow different paths after escaping death at a diner shooting.  They include a teenager played by Dakota Fanning who abruptly finds God and her friend played by Josh Hutcherson who nearly loses his way. Guy Pearce plays a doctor who though he left the diner as the gunman arrived begins dangerously toying with his wife�۪s life. Kate Beckinsale tries out a Southern accent as a waitress who turns to sex while Forest Whitaker hits tilt  as a driving instructor who seeks salvation at a casino." working from a screenplay by Roy Freirich based on his 2007 novel ���Winged Creatures �۝  has no shortage of narrative ambition. The story  opens some time after the shooting then cuts back to the moments before a gunman entered the diner. Mr. Woods continues to toggle between past and present a fragmented strategy that while it suggests the shattering of lives also dilutes the individual stories. More problematically the flashbacks to the massacre are structured so that you learn what happened in the diner ��� who saw what and when ��� bit by remembered bit. Because you don�۪t know what went down until the end after all the bits have been revealed this gives the massacre the feel of a thriller an unfortunate cheapening." the most successful actors are nibbling  at the edges of the movie. As the girl�۪s increasingly baffled mother Jeanne Tripplehorn seems hollowed out and solid as stone; as the boy�۪s father Jackie Earle Haley gives his stoical hard-bitten character both edge and decency. Jennifer Hudson as the driving instructor�۪s daughter lingers after her few short scenes are completed as do the character actors Kevin Durand Walton Goggins Julio Oscar Mechoso and James LeGros as a sympathetic colleague of the doctor. The casting directors Nicole Abellera and Jeanne McCarthy surely deserve some credit for assembling so much talent in one modest movie; if only Mr. Woods knew what to do with them particularly the bigger names all of whom flounder in often awkward unpersuasive turns." Mr. Pearce rises above the melodramatic mire. There isn�۪t much to the doctor beyond his new pathology ��� he begins doping his wife so he can  save her repeatedly ��� but Mr. Pearce reveals the panic in his eyes. By contrast Mr. Whitaker Ms. Beckinsale and even the redoubtable Ms. Fanning have a tough time filling out characters that are at best abstractions of grief and often just clich̩s.

the romance of Nazi resistance movements particularly those inside German-occupied countries is rarely matched by the cruelty such duplicitous action must have demanded. In ���The War: A Memoir �۝ the French writer Marguerite Duras whose husband was deported to an extermination camp (he survived) recalls a female French Resistance fighter who calmly tortures an informer. The torturer compares her work to demolition. ���Blow by blow �۝ Duras writes. ���You have to hold out stick it out. And then soon there will emerge quite small hard as a seed the truth.�۝ Duras implied that she was the torturer though apparently she wasn�۪t. Whatever the truth her representation of the Resistance seems true because of its cruelty." �۝ a 1969 masterpiece based on his experiences in the French underground. The Danish director Ole Christian Madsen looks to have borrowed some Melvillian stylistic flourishes to make ���Flame & Citron �۝ a fictionalized film based on fact about two Danish Resistance fighters. You can see the Melville touch in the impenetrable shadows that spill across Mr. Madsen�۪s carefully composed mise-en-sc̬ne and in the fedoras and trench coats worn by his two heroes (Thure Lindhardt as Flame and Mads Mikkelsen as Citron). What it doesn�۪t share though is the lack of pity that makes ���Army of Shadows�۝ so unbearably sad its almost repellent hardness of heart." Mr. Mikkelsen and Christian Berkel as the head of the Copenhagen Gestapo ��� ensnared in an increasingly tangled narrative line. Written by Mr. Madsen and Lars K. Andersen the film tracks Flame and Citron as they do in Nazis and collaborators ��� for the most part Flame pulls the trigger Citron spins the getaway wheel ��� and their relationships with prickly colleagues and difficult intimates. Citron his face drenched in sweat proves an unreliable family man while the red-haired Flame casts an eye at a femme Ketty (Stine Stengade) who might be fatale." Mr. Madsen fixes on the down-and-dirty logistics of the missions some of which are bungled to good dramatic effect and to the burden increasingly borne by Flame and Citron as a consequence of their bloody work.

a series of bleak frustrating moments shadowed by the guaranteed absurdity of death. This more or less is the lesson ��� or perhaps the premise ��� of ���You the Living �۝ the new film by the Swedish director Roy Andersson. The film is slow rigorously morose and often painful in its blunt reckoning of disappointment and failure. It is also extremely funny." morbid way. At first or on a preliminary viewing (gourmand of masochism that I am I�۪ve seen it twice) the friendly affirmation of the title seems ironic almost to the point of cruelty. (It also echoes the name of Ayn Rand�۪s first novel ���We the Living.�۝) ���You�۝ ��� that is We sitting meekly in the audience anxious mirror images of the sad characters on screen ��� are mired in misery and confusion and might as well give up. But then the irony redoubles and reverses and by the end the generosity of Mr. Andersson�۪s vision is apparent. It becomes clear that we have been watching a deadpan but nonetheless heartfelt affirmation of human existence which may be fragile and pointless but is still worth something." the Living �۝ only the fourth feature Mr. Andersson has made in a career that began more than four decades ago enfolds its considerable aesthetic and intellectual ambition in a plain dry beautifully made wrapper. The director a prolific and inventive maker of television commercials works in the comic tradition of Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati constructing visual gags that are at once painstakingly elaborate and gratifyingly simple. Using a mostly stationary camera he turns the frame into a kind of live-action newspaper cartoon panel. The jokes are sometimes broad sometimes sublimely subtle and sometimes somehow both at once." in which a gaunt gray marching band musician lies on his back straddled by a much fleshier red-haired companion wearing nothing but her lover�۪s Prussian-style headgear. The man rambles on about some trouble he�۪s had with his bank and his flat recitation in counterpoint with the woman�۪s nonverbal exclamations turns the scene into an odd little symphony. And in most of the disjointed vignettes that make up  the film ��� some linked in oblique narratives others standing alone ��� Mr. Andersson�۪s use of sound is as deft and sly as his composition of images." the sousaphone and the bass drum most notably) and the incongruous music of thunder machinery and the Swedish language. Much of the dialogue is spoken directly into the camera as people mostly played by nonprofessional plain-looking actors catalog their woes or recount their dreams. These are dramatized with somber care and they are no more inscrutable or haunting than the waking reality they punctuate." the Living �۝ the appalling keeps close company with the banal and any sense of what it all might mean is kept at arm�۪s length. But while the film is abstract and elusive it is never dull or inaccessible. The drab color scheme ��� muted blues and washed-out yellows ��� attains a delicate painterly beauty and the disconnected scenes have the force and coherence of short poems. Zen limericks perhaps or vaudevillian haikus." bars offices and barbershops are sets a simulated reality only a little less grand (if a lot less manic) than the fake Manhattan  constructed by Philip Seymour Hoffman�۪s character in ���Synecdoche New York.�۝ But the emotions that circulate through this world ��� envy desire befuddlement pity impatience ��� could hardly be more recognizable and the artifice of their setting only makes that familiarity more vivid." sometimes wantonly expressive sometimes the opposite. But their exotically ordinary appearance is Mr. Andersson�۪s cleverest sleight of hand. The title of this movie is meant literally. It�۪s about you."

�۝ a sharply written fast-talking almost dementedly articulate satire on modern statecraft should commence with a verbal slip-up. In an atmosphere of impending military action as the governments of Britain and the United States gear up to invade an unspecified Middle Eastern country Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) the British minister of international development gives an interview to the BBC. Surprised by a question outside his area of expertise ���whatever that might be ��� he declares that in his view ���war is unforeseeable.�۝" which might sound either obvious or opaque to a casual listener ignites a minor firestorm in and around 10 Downing Street since Simon�۪s words seem to depart from the official line. Offered a chance to walk his gaffe back the poor fellow only digs himself deeper. Winging it in front of the news cameras he observes that while peace is of course a desirable state of affairs it is sometimes necessary to climb ���the mountain of conflict.�۝" �۝ directed by Armando Iannucci and written by a crack team of British wits is that it turns this mountain into a series of festering molehills. War is a deadly and consequential business. That much goes without saying and when some of the motley technocrats and would-be statesmen who populate this film do say it their words sound either embarrassingly tinny or patently self-serving. And that�۪s the point: Grave matters involving global power cannot finally be separated from the pettiness of democratic governance which is impelled by careerism vanity moral compromise and in London more than in prim Washington by ear-singeing profanity." Britannia would rule the waves thanks to the uncivil tongue of Malcolm Tucker a powerful press officer. Almost nothing he says  can be quoted here. Loosely based on Alastair Campbell Tony Blair�۪s press secretary and played by Peter Capaldi as a wiry dervish of Scottish hostility Malcolm is so completely cynical that he attains a kind of integrity and thus becomes both the film�۪s chief monster and the closest thing it has to a hero." and no rogue nation or political party is ever mentioned but the real-world template for ���In the Loop�۝ is easy enough to identify. The British-American push to war involves dubious possibly cooked intelligence and voices of dissent inside both governments are silenced and suborned." the film�۪s insights are less topical than procedural. It�۪s not about something that happened but rather about the way things work. Using a mock-v̩rit̩ style familiar from television shows like ���The Office�۝ (and his own series ���The Thick of It �۝ in relation to which this film is somewhere between spinoff and stepchild) Mr. Iannucci maps the queasy interpersonal power games at the heart of any political endeavor. The inhabitants of his universe  are in essence well-connected cubicle rats or junior high school clique members with media access and large standing armies or perhaps Renaissance courtiers with BlackBerrys and power suits." destroying or using one another. But of course all of them ��� the smooth-faced aides the preening deputies the ciphers and backstabbers and the snarling press secretaries who seem to run the whole show ��� are allies colleagues and in a few cases lovers. A journalist�۪s voice is sometimes heard squawking on the other end of a phone line and a single significant member of the public at large materializes in the person of Steve Coogan but otherwise the entire menagerie is as the picture�۪s title implies on the inside and on the same side." needless to say is divided against itself. The hapless Simon is pulled this way and that by two rival underlings the sharp-tongued Judy (Gina McKee) and the deceptively guileless Toby (Chris Addison). Their  boss is also sucked into a power struggle between two opposing state department honchos Karen Clark (Mimi Kennedy) who wants to slow down the rush to war and Linton Barwick (David Rasche) who wants to speed it up. Karen and Linton have a pair of antagonistic aides Chad (Zach Woods) and Liza (Anna Chlumsky) eager young things already adept at smiling collegial knife work." though at times it looks more like a tangle of crossed wires. The short summary is that everybody betrays everybody else that opportunism trumps idealism and that telling the truth is a matter of tactical calculation rather than  ethical imperative. The principal doves ��� Karen and a sensitive Pentagon general played by James Gandolfini ��� are as puffed up and shabby as the hawks. Nobody�۪s motives are pure and when it�۪s all sorted out the killing will start." meanwhile is likely to die laughing. While ���In the Loop�۝ is a highly disciplined inquiry into a very serious subject it is also line by filthy line scene by chaotic scene by far the funniest big-screen satire in recent memory. The hand-held camera work the hectic jump-cuts and the grubby visuals may  resemble television but the restless pacing and drab  appearance serve a clear aesthetic purpose. The film visits some of the world�۪s great monuments to liberty and order on both sides of the Atlantic ��� 10 Downing Street the White House the United Nations headquarters ��� and they�۪ve never looked worse as if shot through a filter made of grime." which is also evidence of Mr. Iannucci�۪s satirical rigor. The people in whose hands momentous decisions rest are shown ��� convincingly and in squirming detail  ��� to be duplicitous vindictive small-minded and untrustworthy.

�۝ the disembodied British voice says over the image of an empty operating room. That voice ��� softly rounded male caressing somehow naturally comforting ��� belongs to Henry Marsh the British brain surgeon whose humanity and talent with power drills make him an uncommonly enthralling linchpin in the documentary ���The English Surgeon.�۝" ���The English Surgeon�۝ centers largely on  Dr. Marsh�۪s  admirably generous charity  work in  Ukraine. He became involved in the Ukrainian medical world he explains in a voice-over when after delivering a speech in that former Soviet satellite in 1992 he discovered the appalling  state of one of its hospitals." Dr. Igor Kurilets he sought to improve conditions by exporting equipment from chairs to used-if-still-usable surgical tools and performing advanced costly operations. Decency  appears to motivate Dr. Marsh ��� he doesn�۪t  seem to receive any monetary compensation for his trouble just an evident sense of well-being ��� as do the travails of Dr. Kurilets whose efforts to modernize his country�۪s medical system have brought him consistent grief." a bespectacled man whose perpetually bowed head suggests a tremendous burden doesn�۪t have it easy. He rents space for his clinic from the Ukrainian Security Service (the successor to the K.G.B.) and yearns to build a hospital he can�۪t yet afford. He  is at constant odds with the medical establishment: he couldn�۪t practice for a few years because of one kerfuffle. More details and shading would be welcome along with a few contrasting even contesting voices but Mr. Smith    doesn�۪t supply expansive historical context professional or otherwise. Much like the doctors�۪ bona fides and backgrounds the details of their personal lives remain blurred. Is the attractive unidentified blonde hovering in Dr. Marsh�۪s house his wife girlfriend? It�۪s uncertain." though Mr. Smith leaves some things unsaid or only in vague outline he rather wonderfully and appropriately does get you somewhat inside the heads of the two surgeons. You might not learn  the names of their favorite musicians or the  hospitals  where they�۪ve practiced but you do discover   early on that Dr. Marsh himself builds the wood crates he uses to ship equipment to  Ukraine and that he works on the rough planks with careful exacting movements. These early images of his hands fabricating the crates initially register as so much filler or comic relief (he does like his drills) yet it�۪s precisely this kind of  nominal throwaway detail that turns the good doctor into a great character." joking and operating alongside Dr. Kurilets. Sitting next to each other in a cramped consulting room in the Ukrainian clinic they examine charts discuss treatments and deliver the sometimes heartening sometimes wretched news to patients for whom they represent the final stop. The bleakness of the clinic is claustrophobic unrelenting. There are moments when its grim walls and unsmiling functionaries bring to mind the Romanian drama ���The Death of Mr. Lazarescu �۝ albeit without that fiction�۪s ameliorating mordant humor and intellectual distance. There is another similarity: in ���Lazarescu�۝ the sick die partly because of the indifference and poverty produced by decades of totalitarianism. The same holds true here." Mr. Smith lavishes most of his attention on the eminently quotable Dr. Marsh. (If the British doctor is more appealing it�۪s because he appears happier: he can after all leave the country.)  The other important character is Marian a young man with a sizable tumor whose brain takes pride of cinematic place during an on-camera operation. Mr. Smith isn�۪t above exploiting his material a tendency most evident in an abrupt image of a surgeon using an instrument that for all intents and purposes makes it look as if he were flossing a skull. As Dr. Marsh says hospitals are full of a small number of people doing horrible things to a large number of people." Mr. Smith thankfully does prepare you for the most graphic set piece Marian�۪s operation a procedure that is in a word astonishing. It is perhaps to state the obvious unsettling if strangely reassuring to watch a skilled surgeon rummaging around the brain of another human being. Yet what resonates most deeply in this unexpectedly effective and often affecting documentary is not the whirring grinding and wet noises of Marian�۪s operation or even the images of his brain pulsating under a window cut into his skull. It�۪s a quiet quietly haunting scene in which the surgeons their faces knotted and gray struggle to find a way to tell a 23-year-old that she�۪s going to die. These men perform miracles but they are also agonizingly human." Graham Day; edited by Kathy O�۪Shea; music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis; released by Eyeline Films.

most notably the suffragist movement in the early part of the last century and women�۪s rights toward the latter. Liberated women along with the pill quickie divorces swinging couples blended families and various wars both abroad and at home might have dinged the genre but it has endured and adapted even when the story now hinges on boy meets boy meets boy (as in ���Shortbus�۝)  or pops up on the small screen (���Sex and the City�۝)." however you might as well forget it at least if you�۪re a woman. Outside of Judd Apatow who has carved out a niche and inspired something of a subgenre with movies about funny smutty but sincere man-boys puzzling their way through adult heterosexual relations the romantic comedy is nearly as dead as Meg Ryan�۪s career. In the best of these films the women aren�۪t romantic foils much less equals: they�۪re either (nice) sluts or (nicer) wives and essentially as mysterious and unknowable as the dark side of the moon. In the most calculating (���The Hangover�۝) they are strippers with hearts and racks of gold or emasculating shrews." �۝ a cynical clumsy aptly titled attempt to cross the female-oriented romantic comedy with the male-oriented gross-out comedy that is interesting on several levels none having to do with cinema. Katherine Heigl plays Abby a producer for a ratings-challenged Sacramento morning television show the kind that specializes in empty smiles cooking tips and weather updates. She�۪s single and therefore in the moral economy of modern Hollywood unhappy. Her life goes into a tailspin when her boss hires a professional ape Mike (Gerard Butler) who delivers loutish maxims on camera about the sexes that basically all boil down to this: Men have penises and women should accommodate them any which way they can preferably in push-up bras and remote-controlled vibrating panties." bathed in an otherworldly golden light that makes their skin look honey-roasted and turns their teeth into beacons look tasty indeed almost finger-lickin�۪ good. Ms. Heigl doesn�۪t do perky all that persuasively but she does keep her smile and relative dignity even in scenes in which Abby is forced to play the fool which is often as when she�۪s hanging upside down from a tree in her skivvies. She even survives the scene that finds Abby writhing spasmodically during a dinner with her corporate masters because well she�۪s wearing those pulsating panties the boy at the next table has the remote and there�۪s nothing funnier (or really scarier) than the spectacle of female pleasure. Well it worked in ���When Harry Met Sally.�۝" Robert Luketic who did far better with ���Legally Blonde �۝ appears to have instructed his actors to (over)play their roles for the hard of seeing and hard of hearing resulting in across-the-board loud line readings mugging faces and flopping (clothed) body parts. Mr. Butler an appealing screen presence who needs better roles or savvier career counseling does his grinning best with a charmless unbelievable character who of course is hiding a wounded heart under his leathery man hide. (The first tip-off: Mike provides babe advice to his young nephew an ape in training.) The fantasy of the redeemable even lovable cad is a favorite romantic fantasy one that the writers Nicole Eastman Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith peddle shamelessly." which is overseen by Amy Pascal the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. One of the lessons of ���The Ugly Truth�۝ ��� beyond the obvious one that a desirable desiring woman can never ever be happily single and sexual in modern Hollywood ��� is that holding to your hard-won ideals is of no consequence at least when there�۪s a guy to be hooked. When Mike is brought in Abby fights him because she sees him for what he is: the lowest common denominator.

I�۪m willing to concede probably one of the best ��� is about an hour shorter than ���Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen �۝ half as pretentious and twice as witty. Call this faint praise if you like. ���G-Force �۝ as loud and enervating as the words ���A Jerry Bruckheimer Production�۝ might lead you to expect can hardly be accused of modesty but on the other hand no film full of talking guinea pigs would be so rash as to attempt the kind of lumbering gravitas that Michael Bay has seen fit to bestow on a bunch of toys." clanking climax in which blenders coffee makers and other appliances turn angry and amalgamate into robotic apocalyptic threats to civilization as we know it almost seems like a critique of ���Transformers.�۝ Or maybe ���critique�۝ is the wrong word. Kids like big noisy destructive metal robots. They also like furry little rodents who speak in the voices of Sam Rockwell and Pen̩lope Cruz (especially all those 10-year-olds who dug ���Choke�۝ and ���Vicky Cristina Barcelona�۝). So if you make a movie that has both robots and rodents plus a bunch of swaggering catch phrases a couple of flatulence jokes and a bunch of human actors hopping around pretending to interact with the computer-generated rodents ��� well the pitch makes itself doesn�۪t it?" maybe not the right word ��� behind ���G-Force �۝ which manages to be fairly entertaining in that exhausting rackety late-summer-kiddie-movie way. Mr. Rockwell and Ms. Cruz are joined by Tracy Morgan and Nicolas Cage his voice almost unrecognizable playing a mole named Speckles. The other three are guinea pigs and this foursome is part of an off-the-books experiment run by a renegade government nerd played by Zach Galifianakis.

The 3-D application (available in some theaters) has the odd effect of making the animated critters look warmer and more real than the actual people and it must be said that some of the action sequences are impressively executed and edited. One of the best is a fairly simple gag in which two guinea pigs go rocketing down a suburban street in an old tire. I mean simple as a visual conceit since a great deal of effort and ingenuity must have been expended in putting this amusing little sequence together." and the money behind it might have been spent on a better script or a different movie. ���G-Force �۝ directed by Hoyt Yeatman lives up to its promise to provide nearly an hour and a half of semicrude jokes and big effects pausing for an obligatory scene of heartfelt lesson learning in which the guinea pigs are encouraged to believe in themselves. Fine. It can�۪t hurt." which as we all know can be harnessed for good or for evil.

�۝ the anonymous title character (Nina Hoss) runs into an old friend. It is 1945 the German capital has recently fallen to the Soviet Army and the two women exchange what is  apparently a common greeting at that time and place: ���How often?�۝ The unspoken self-evident meaning of this question is ���How many Russian soldiers have raped you?�۝ That such horrific information can be exchanged so matter-of-factly even with rueful stoical humor can stand as a concise summary of the insights offered by Max F�_rberb̦ck�۪s sprawling difficult powerful film." certainly not to the women who suffered them. But the systematic rape of German women by Russian soldiers was nonetheless shrouded in silence for decades. When the diary that provided the source material for ���A Woman in Berlin�۝ was first published in Germany in 1959 it was attacked in print and quickly pushed aside. In West Germany patriarchal attitudes defining male sexual violence as a matter of female honor made the frankness of the diary seem brazen and shameful while in the East criticism of the heroic Soviet liberators was forbidden." and its subsequent adaptation by Mr. F�_rberb̦ck were thus enabled both by the rise of feminism and the collapse of Communism. And ���A Woman in Berlin�۝ is timely in another sense: it is part of a wave of recent cinematic explorations of World War II and its aftermath (mostly but not exclusively European and including Mr. F�_rberb̦ck�۪s earlier ���Aim̩e & Jaguar�۝) that try to tease out some of that era�۪s hidden stories and ethical ambiguities." �۝ but from the start the notion that anyone in Berlin in the spring of 1945 could be considered innocent is put aside. An early flashback shows the main character a journalist and photographer engaged to a military officer (August Diehl) at a party some years before where she and her companions radiate smug patriotic pride at their country�۪s marvelous destiny. Their gaiety is quieted for a moment of silence in honor of the brave young men serving in combat which is to say waging a war of extermination and terror across Europe." however are the Russians depicted as monsters. Rather the accomplishment of ���A Woman in Berlin�۝ is to tell its story ��� much as the author of the original diaries did ��� with a combination of dispassionate clarity and complex human feeling." off-center close-ups and teeming medium-range shots ���  conveys danger and intensity without resorting to graphic extremity. To turn away from the initial rapes would be evasive whereas to show them in too much detail would risk prurience and exploitation. Instead he emphasizes the fear the sudden violence and the women�۪s struggle to hold on to their dignity." whose strong frame and graceful bearing suggest both old-style movie-star glamour and Aryan ideals of feminine beauty is an actress of haunting subtlety and the film episodic ambitious and a few beats too long is held together by the force of her performance. The story turns on her decision at a moment of profound powerlessness to exercise some measure of control over her circumstances by vowing that no more Russian soldiers will sleep with her without her consent." one taken up by the other women living in the half-wrecked but nonetheless habitable apartment building where much of the film�۪s action takes place. A widow (Irm Hermann) ���who could be had for a bit of bacon�۝ seems almost to delight in her newfound sexual attractiveness and clings to quaint bourgeois notions of decorum and civility when entertaining the military emissaries of the worker�۪s paradise." seeking out a protector settles on a sad-faced major named Andrej (Evgeny Sidikhin) and the affair between them is sometimes tense sometimes tender and sometimes bluntly transactional. The relationship becomes a lens through which the film refracts its thoughts about politics sexual and otherwise. Andrej and the woman conduct a kind of intuitive diplomacy brokering a delicate entente between the groups they represent." ���A Woman in Berlin�۝ is also lively and observant stocked with vivid minor characters and well-observed scenes that capture glints of comedy in the midst of desperation. That the film manages to be understated calm and intelligent in spite of its wrenching subject matter is perhaps its most impressive accomplishment.

Given all this it�۪s somewhat remarkable that ���(500) Days �۝ the feature directing debut of the music video auteur Marc Webb is neither depressing nor French." all the same a fairly pointed response to the sorry state of romantic comedy in Hollywood which runs the gamut from gauzily implausible fantasy to blatant and fatuous dishonesty with an occasional detour into raunchy humor. The governing commercial calculus these days seems to be that dudes want smut ladies want weddings and a picture (like ���The Hangover �۝ say) that delivers both will make the audience happy and the studios rich." and perhaps more authentic feelings and attitudes must be spoken about either with subtitles or from time to time in mumbles. So a winsome accessible movie about more-or-less recognizable young people navigating the murky waters of post-sexual-revolutionary midrecessionary heterosexual attraction has a novelty and a measure of bravery working in its favor whatever its shortcomings.

not quite. ���Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince �۝ the latest big-screen iteration of the global phenomenon is merely the sixth chapter in a now eight-part series that much like its young hero played by Daniel Radcliffe has begun to show signs of stress around the edges a bit of fatigue or maybe that�۪s just my gnawing impatience. Not that the director David Yates doesn�۪t keep things moving and flying and soaring his cameras slashing through the gloom that has settled onto this epic endeavor like a damp enveloping fog and at times threatened to snuff out its joy as terminally as a soul-sucking Dementor." the poisonous potions and murderous sentiments is partly a testament to the remarkable sturdiness of this movie franchise which has transformed in subtle and obvious fashion changing in tandem with the sprouting bodies and slowly evolving personalities of its young now teenage characters. The series is now almost as old (it took off in 2001) as Harry was when he started his journey which found the orphan whisked after his 11th birthday from a cramped tragic nook to Hogwarts a school of witchcraft and wizardry in a parallel world teeming with wondrous creatures including an embarrassment of lavishly talented British screen actors." who has written all the screenplays save for No. 5 ���The Half-Blood Prince�۝ was to be the penultimate film the corollary to the J. K. Rowling book. Instead the concluding volume ���Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows �۝ has been deemed hefty enough by Warner Brothers ��� 784 hardcover pages 2.4 pounds shipping weight a fight to the death ��� to be split into two movies that will hit in late 2010 and summer 2011. Considering that the take for Harry Potter and His Big Pot of Cinematic Gold now totals almost $4.5 billion in international box office the studio�۪s reluctance to embrace the end is touchingly obvious." seriously could we just get on with it? For at least one committed follower of the series who closed the last chapter on Harry soon after ���The Deathly Hallows�۝ was published in 2007 the lag time between the final books and the movies has drained much of the urgency from this screen adaptation which far more than any of the previous films comes across as an afterthought. Mr. Yates who directed the last movie ���Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix �۝ which also arrived in summer 2007 does a fine job of keeping Ms. Rowling�۪s multiple parts in balanced play nimbly shifting between the action and the adolescent soap operatics. Yet even with a surer directorial touch he can�۪t keep the whole thing from feeling like filler." starting with some preliminary mayhem meant to signal that this  isn�۪t your 10-year-old�۪s Harry Potter." with Harry bloodied but victorious the new picture opens in London where an office filled with nonmagical humans (Muggles in Rowling-speak) are staring out the high-rise windows ��� as slack-jawed presumably as those filling theater seats ��� at sinister gray clouds surging in the sky. Suddenly three plumes of black smoke Death Eaters in fast fuming motion cut through the moody overhead dome race through the streets and wobble the pedestrian-only Millennium Bridge that slings across the Thames snapping cables fatally upending human bodies and further unnerving the wizardly world." well there�۪s always Wikipedia. Although Mr. Kloves has done an admirable job tailoring Ms. Rowling�۪s progressively longer and baggier books he or perhaps more accurately the series�۪s producers have not made many concessions for the uninitiated. If you have kept pace you will grasp why Dumbledore (the invaluable Michael Gambon) the headmaster of Hogwarts has placed so much trust in Harry a callow student with prodigious wizard gifts and little discernable personality. The chosen one Harry has been commissioned to destroy the too-little-seen evildoer Voldemort a sluglike ghoul usually played by Ralph Fiennes (alas seen only briefly this time out) and here played in his early embodied form as Tom Riddle by the excellent young actors Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Frank Dillane." who plays the dark lord as a spectrally pale creepy child of 11 is Ralph Fiennes�۪s nephew and Frank is the son of the terrific actor Stephen Dillane (Thomas Jefferson in the HBO mini-series ���John Adams�۝). The younger Mr. Dillane who plays Voldemort at 16 conveys the seductiveness of evil with small silky smiles he bestows like dangerous gifts on Jim Broadbent�۪s Horace Slughorn a professor whose trembling jowls suggest a deeper tremulousness. When Slughorn the fear almost visibly leaking from his body shares the secret of immortality with Voldemort you feel much as when Ralph Fiennes raged through ���Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire�۝ in 2005 that something vital is at stake." �۝ it�۪s partly because the series finale is both too close and too far away and partly because Mr. Radcliffe and his co-stars Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as Harry�۪s friends Hermione and Ron have grown up into three prettily manicured bores. Unlike the veterans notably the sensational Alan Rickman who invests his character Prof. Severus Snape with much-needed ambiguity drawing each word out with exquisite luxury bringing to mind a buzzard lazily pulling at entrails Mr. Radcliffe in particular proves incapable of the most crucial cinematic magic. Namely the alchemical transformation of dialogue into something that feels like passion something that feels real and true and makes you as wild for Harry as for all those enticingly dark forces." though sometimes rather intense." based on the book by J.

Mrs. Goldberg �۝ Aviva  Kempner�۪s engrossing documentary portrait of a once-beloved radio and television star who died in 1966 and today is barely remembered. The film could be described as Exhibit A in a study of media celebrity and collective forgetfulness in the age of information overload." 1929 less than a month after the stock market crash ���The Rise of the Goldbergs �۝ a 15-minute family sitcom Berg wrote produced and starred in was first heard  on the radio. With its name later shortened to ���The Goldbergs �۝ the show chronicling the domestic life of a struggling Jewish family in a Bronx tenement remained on the air for the next 17 years and earned its creator the nickname the First Lady of Radio." �۝ it established the character-driven domestic sitcom as a staple television genre and won Berg the first Emmy for best actress." Berg who adopted a Yiddish accent to play the malapropism-spewing Bronx Jewish matriarch Molly Goldberg was voted the second-most-admired woman in America after Eleanor Roosevelt according to the film. The signature gesture of the homey gregarious Molly was to lean out her apartment window and call out ���yoo-hoo�۝ to neighbors with whom she exchanged the urban equivalent of back-fence gossip." the show had its serious moments. In one episode a rock was thrown through the window as the family held a Passover Seder. Other shows included references to overseas relatives threatened by the Holocaust." who was born Tillie Edelstein in 1898 was not at all like her character. Elegant and well dressed a workhorse and a taskmaster with a home on Park Avenue she wrote 12 000 scripts for the show which consumed her life to the point that in a ���Person to Person�۝ interview with Edward R. Murrow excerpted in the documentary she muses that she spent more time researching writing and playing Molly than being herself." Berg developed her talents writing and directing sketches to entertain guests during rainy weather. At 18 she married Lewis Berg an older  Englishman and chemical engineer with whom she had two children." who played Molly�۪s husband Jake as a Communist sympathizer. When the show�۪s sponsor General Foods delivered an ultimatum that Loeb be fired within two days Berg stood by him and threatened to persuade  the public to boycott the company. Although General Foods backed down the show was canceled several months later." who agreed only on the condition that she convert to Roman Catholicism which she refused to do. A broken man Loeb committed suicide in 1955. Although a replacement was later found and ���The Goldbergs�۝ returned to television it was never the same and when its setting was moved to the suburbs it lasted for only one season." Berg joined a cast of blacklisted actors in a TV presentation of ���The World of Sholom Aleichem �۝ a show that helped break the blacklist and went on to triumph on Broadway winning the 1959 Tony Award for best actress in a play for ���A Majority of One.�۝ She was heartbroken when Rosalind Russell got her role in the movie adaptation." Mrs. Goldberg�۝ has a generous helping of old kinescopes of ���The Goldbergs�۝ and respectful recollections of grandchildren acquaintances and admirers including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

The movie doesn�۪t strain for symbolism but you might view Sergey wonderfully played by Mr. Lyapin as the embodiment of a young generation of Russians recklessly barging into an unforeseeable future." elegiac film with a screenplay by Sergey Rokotov and Evgeny Nikishov embraces a view of history that is more far-reaching than the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. Sergey lives with his younger brother mother and a beloved grandfather a distinguished archaeologist who is more amused than outraged when his grandson steals his valuable old books to sell to used-book stores for cash to buy contraband albums and imported jeans." he has a vision of a desolate ruin in Khorezm that his grandfather calls the City of the Wind.

A partial list as I say of performers captured with remarkable sonic brilliance and visual immediacy on an outdoor stage in Kinshasa Zaire (now Congo) in 1974." you will by now have stopped reading and gone off to order tickets to this extravagantly entertaining documentary assembled by Jeffrey Levy-Hinte from a trove of hundreds of hours of footage captured by some of the world�۪s finest cin̩ma v̩rit̩ camera operators some 35 years ago." and the release of ���Soul Power�۝ may lead to a rash of unlikely passionate claims to have been in Zaire when this monumental and now half-forgotten concert went down. It�۪s not too late. And if for some reason you think of James Brown and Bill Withers  as dusty names in the annals of popular music this movie will help you complete your education." ���Soul Power�۝ offers a vivid glimpse of a fascinating moment in musical history racial politics and global pop culture. The Zaire �۪74 festival was originally conceived as a companion to the heavyweight championship fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Just before the concert was scheduled to begin and too late for postponement Mr. Foreman injured his eye. The bout was pushed back six weeks but the show went on." though it took a long time for the images to see the light of day. ���When We Were Kings �۝ Leon Gast�۪s unforgettable account of the Ali-Foreman fight was released in 1996 and included only glancing mention of the concert. Mr. Levy-Hinte�۪s film complements Mr. Gast�۪s though its approach is a little different. There are no ex post facto talking-head interviews with witnesses and interpreters (though George Plimpton does show up drunk at a party). Instead the music and the musicians speak for themselves." vain shrewd and witty as ever cooling his heels and running his mouth expounding on the legacies of colonialism and slavery and presenting himself hyperbolically and in sly earnest as a global ambassador of freedom and justice. The promoter Don King is also on hand spinning rhetorical webs that link his own commercial interests with the causes of liberation and self-determination. He sometimes has a point though Brown makes it more succinctly and with a bit more credibility when he observes that ���you can�۪t get liberated broke.�۝" a corrupt and brutal strongman with a touch of theatrical flair and unusual fashion sense Zaire �۪74 may not stand up very well as the expression of a political cause. But the preparations in New York and in Kinshasa illuminate the complexities and contradictions of organizing a modern media spectacle in a third-world country and suggest that some of the perks and stresses of show business are pretty much the same wherever you go." African-American and Caribbean musical expression collide and commingle providing enough research material for a course in ethnomusicology. The beats of Ms. Cruz and her salseros bounce off the rhythms of Zairean dancers while the sounds of Memphis and Philadelphia both echo and feed the songs of Mali and South Africa." performing a call and response with a group of children. Other children are shown doing marching exercises which look like versions of the crisply choreographed stages moves executed by the Spinners. At the end Brown a musical cosmos unto himself sums it all up and breaks it all down." natural and free. ���Soul Power �۝ as aptly and succinctly titled a movie as I have ever seen takes you to a place where the discipline that produces great popular art is indistinguishable from the ecstasy that art creates."

There is also the troubling question of how to explain all this to Anna." ���Humpday�۝ explores the ramifications of their decision in a free-form Mumblecore style. Much of the dialogue in a film that rarely stops talking was semi-improvised and as Ben and Andrew who are perfectly cast consider the fine print of their verbal agreement most of what they say sounds convincingly spontaneous. For starters there is the matter of role playing a question that is too daunting to explore when the subject is broached." there is no intimation of any lurking erotic subtext in their friendship. And in a revealing moment Andrew about to have a threesome with the party hostess and her girlfriend loses his nerve when they produce an array of sex toys." anything-for-a-lark pose he is deeply conventional.

The case however proves to be something of a distraction since Bertrand�۪s attention is quickly hijacked by Audrey Varella (Louise Bourgoin) a minor local celebrity ��� and major party girl ��� whose television weather report pretty much makes ordering soft-core pay-per-view on hotel-room cable redundant." with her generous curves her skimpy clothes and her complete lack of inhibition is a middle-aged male fantasy come to life would be to state the obvious. And the director Anne Fontaine is clearly at least in part offering up a satire on male sexual vanity and the capacity for self-delusion it creates. Bertrand is established early on as something of a playboy but Audrey�۪s forthrightness along with the apparently unfeigned intensity of her desire for him knocks him off balance. He makes a fool of himself at nightclubs and on beaches and experiences bouts of jealousy and insecurity that follow like bad hangovers in the wake of erotic bliss." his baroque eloquence a big turn-on for Audrey Bertrand is also its simplest most psychologically transparent character. Audrey is trickier not so much because she is inwardly complex but because Ms. Fontaine seems not quite to have figured out what she is supposed to be and how seriously she is meant to be taken. Audrey  sometimes seems to be a stereotypical dumb blonde at others a gold digger a tease a carnal free spirit and a needy capricious Medusa." Christophe hired to be Bertrand�۪s bodyguard is a former lover of Audrey�۪s. The two men play out a sly buddy comedy that is the film�۪s most fully worked-out and pleasurable aspect with Mr. Zem�۪s enigmatic stoicism contrasting amusingly with Mr. Luchini�۪s pomp and vanity. Christophe�۪s own feelings ��� about Audrey about his employer about the line between duty and passion ��� remain mysterious almost until the end." and also a sequence of events that has faint echoes of ���Mildred Pierce.�۝ But somehow Ms. Fontaine�۪s attempt to mix styles and genres does not quite work and instead of drawing tighter ���The Girl from Monaco�۝ snaps and slackens its apparent ingenuity revealed as a dubious contrivance." it does at least have an interesting sense of place.

it revisits with meticulous detail and convulsions of violence a short frantic period in the life and bank-robbing times of John Dillinger an Indiana farm boy turned Depression outlaw played by a low-voltage Johnny Depp. Much of what makes the movie pleasurable is the vigor with which it restages our familiar romance with period criminals a perennial affair. But what also makes it more than the sum of its spectacular shootouts is the ambivalence about this romance that seeps into the filmmaking steadily darkening the skies and draining the story of easy thrills." it is the kind of sky that tends to show up as a backdrop in paintings of the Madonna and Child but here offers a sharp contrast to the long-distance image of Dillinger and his friend Red (Jason Clarke) quickly striding toward an enormous looming prison. Mr. Mann goes in closer once the men enter the prison where they help disarm the guards and he pulls back again for the long view as Dillinger fires on the prison with a machine gun while the escapees make a run for the getaway car." you might expect that this vision of the suddenly lone gunman would serve as a prelude to another exciting joy ride about living fast and dying young. Instead it�۪s followed by a striking short scene of a wounded escapee being dragged alongside the speeding car while Dillinger and another man struggle to pull him up. In the most startling shot Mr. Mann places the camera right next to the fallen man pointing it up at Dillinger�۪s dark ominous figure as he almost blots out that blue sky. Dillinger holds on until the man�۪s grip wilts the dead body slipping away in one direction as the car races off in the other. Laying the blame elsewhere he next tosses another man out of the moving car." then is Mr. Mann�۪s Dillinger: brave enough to stand his ground loyal ruthless. There�۪s a hint of the demonic in this portrait particularly when the outlaw  is gliding through a bank his long dark coat fanning around him and a tommy gun in one hand. This is the stuff of legends of shoot-�۪em-ups and matinee gangsters with jaunty smiles. Mr. Mann loves this apparition of calculated bravura and initially he frames the first few heists as seamlessly choreographed set pieces. During the first robbery  he shows Dillinger and two accomplices from high overhead the camera peering straight down as the men fan across a black-and-white bank floor like MGM dancers. When Dillinger leaps across a railing he soars." not just the law ��� and much like the other action scenes it gives the movie a jolt. It also perhaps in homage mirrors a similar shot of the escaping serial killer in David Fincher�۪s ���Seven.�۝ Like Mr. Fincher Mr. Mann makes big-budget art movies that because of their complex pleasures and ambiguities don�۪t always hit the box office sweet spot (���Seven�۝ and ���Collateral �۝ Mr. Mann�۪s movie with Tom Cruise being exceptions). Despite Mr. Mann�۪s mainstream bona fides notably with the 1980s hit TV show ���Miami Vice �۝ and preference for muscular cinematic genres there�۪s something resolutely noncommercial about his movies. Among other things they�۪re deeply serious (at times to the edge of parody) which is why they rarely pop." a vividly realistic if fictionalized portrait of a country deep in depression and jumping with bad men. The story centers on two dramatic antagonists Dillinger and Melvin Purvis (a remote Christian Bale) the F.B.I. agent who doggedly if often ineptly led the hunt for America�۪s most wanted. At first  the bureau�۪s young chief J. Edgar Hoover (a terrific Billy Crudup his neck thickened and delivery clipped) ignored Dillinger deeming him a state problem. Hoover would have been spared embarrassment if the outlaw  had remained out of federal jurisdiction because when the chase was on it was with agents who didn�۪t know how to conduct a stakeout or properly fire their guns." Hoover cultivated a public profile that looked good on paper and later up on the screen. They had a lot of competition. Bonnie and Clyde were running wild as were Pretty Boy Floyd Baby Face Nelson and other hoods with marquee-ready stories some of whom make appearances here. Banks made for easy targets logistically and otherwise and as the writer Bryan Burrough points out in a book about America�۪s inaugural war on crime these outlaws took advantage of the public�۪s hatred of those recently failed institutions. Dillinger raided bank vaults and staged prison breaks to increasing approval. He shot one man to death though didn�۪t always own up to the killing. It was bad for his image." Honey �۝ he instructed one female teller with his crooked smile. The press raised his profile with screaming headlines and the comic Will Rogers joked about the ineptitude of the authorities. (They were going to shoot Dillinger Rogers joked but ���another bunch of folks came out ahead;  so they shot them instead.�۝) Mr. Mann working with incidents drawn from Mr. Burrough�۪s ���Public Enemies: America�۪s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the F.B.I. 1933-34 �۝ underscores the celebrity angle. But that�۪s only part of the big picture sketched out in his ambitious screenplay written with Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman which also makes room for a love story amid the blazing guns and tabloid glory." holding her own in this man�۪s world) eats up considerable time sometimes winningly though both actors are better when they�۪re apart. When not in pirate drag Mr. Depp can be a recessive even inscrutable screen presence which is crucial to his strengths and performative limits. He�۪s a cool cat to be sure: veiled and often most memorable when he�۪s staring into space while the camera soaks in his subdued but potent physical charms. He might have made a great silent star as earlier roles suggest. Part of his initial appeal was that he seemed almost Garboesque in a movie world that increasingly makes no room for sacred idols." inching into your system scene by scene. The same holds true of ���Public Enemies �۝  which looks and plays like no other American gangster film  I can think of and very much like a Michael Mann movie with its emphasis on men at work its darkly moody passages eruptions of violence and pictorial beauty. Mr. Mann�۪s digital manipulations in particular which encompass almost pure abstraction and interludes of hyper-realism is worthy of longer exegesis one that explores how this still-unfamiliar format is changing the movies: it allows among other things filmmakers to capture the eerie brightness of nighttime as never before." not only because it�۪s been shot in digital but also because Mr. Mann is searching for a new kind of gangster story to fit the times one that makes room for greater ambivalence and lawmen and outlaws who are closer to one another in temperament and deed. If he doesn�۪t fully succeed it�۪s because he knows that the gangster�۪s rakish smile is at once a fiction of cinema and one of its great irresistible lies. During the big finish Dillinger grins wryly at a black-and-white Hollywood picture with Clark Gable as the kind of gangster who could only have been invented by the movies a gangster who is as false as the bullets that finally stopped Dillinger were real."

But it has ambitions beyond mere ghoulish mawkishness. The director Nick Cassavetes has in the past in movies like ���The Notebook�۝ and ���John Q �۝ attempted a kind of honest manipulation wringing outsize waves of emotion out of more or less ordinary situations and trying to hold on to some notion of realism in the process." he assembles an able cast into a family defined and distorted by the leukemia of their older daughter and middle child Kate (Sofia Vassilieva). Kate�۪s disease was diagnosed when she was a toddler and to save her life her parents Sara (Cameron Diaz) and Brian (Jason Patric) conceived another daughter Anna (Abigail Breslin) who was genetically engineered to be a perfect donor of blood marrow and whatever else Kate might need. Most of this is told through flashbacks as each member of the family ��� there is also an older brother Jesse (Evan Ellingson) ��� takes a turn providing voice-over narration and giving his or her own perspective on the story so far." Anna has engaged a lawyer ��� a marvelously florid Alec Baldwin ��� to represent her in a suit against her parents. She wants to be medically emancipated and not compelled to give up the kidney her sister now desperately needs. Her action sends a shock wave through the family enraging her mother and throwing what had seemed to be agreed-upon principles into doubt. And yet because of their long habits of comfort and care the five Fitzgeralds seem to hang together in spite of Anna�۪s apparent betrayal." which are passed over rather lightly as the case comes before a judge (Joan Cusack) who has recently lost her own daughter. Do Anna�۪s rights to govern her own body trump her obligations to the sister she claims to love? Is she prepared to let Kate die?" which is explored with varying degrees of superficiality and plausibility. Ms. Diaz is entirely believable as an ambitious tough-minded woman whose ferocious protectiveness makes her at once heroic and a little monstrous and Ms. Breslin and Ms. Vassilieva both nimbly navigate tricky roles finding a vein of humor that undercuts some of the maudlin moments and adds to the emotional impact of the story." who wrote the script with Jeremy Leven has changed some  details of Ms. Picoult�۪s novel in particular by taking out a grotesquely shocking plot twist and replacing it with one that is mildly surprising even as it reveals some of the film�۪s themes to be red herrings." ���My Sister�۪s Keeper�۝ manages to be quietly insightful. A touching subplot traced in a long patient flashback about a romance between Kate and a young fellow cancer patient (Thomas Dekker) is one of the few extended passages in the film that have some of the fine grain of lived experience. In general though Mr. Cassavetes writes in the shorthand of sentimentality rather than the prose of real feeling relying on montage sequences blackout cuts the mellow golden hues of Caleb Deschanel�۪s cinematography and a heart-tweaking musical soundtrack as a substitute for hard dramatic work." and to the extent that Ms. Vassilieva has embodied an authentic adolescent rather than a symbol of suffering they are earned. But the film cannot quite decide what to make of the Fitzgerald family tragedy. It tries to some extent to resist the temptation to spiritualize Kate by finding meaning or comfort in her terrible situation even as it succumbs in the end to creepy and unconvincing redemptive impulses. ���My Sister�۪s Keeper�۝ takes on a very tough subject ��� and has in Anna and Kate two pretty tough characters played by strong young actresses ��� but ultimately it is too soft too easy and it dissolves like a tear-soaked tissue." occasional strong language and some upsetting hospital scenes." based on the novel by Jodi Picoult; director of photography Caleb Deschanel; edited by Alan Heim and Jim Flynn; music by Aaron Zigman; production designer Jon Hutman; produced by Mark Johnson Chuck Pacheco and Scott L.

Herself a former courtesan Charlotte solicits L̩a�۪s help with Ch̩ri a 19-year-old who�۪s cultivating his dissolution. With cheekbones so sharply angled they look like they could slice through a caressing hand Ch̩ri seems a perilous project. But L̩a who�۪s known him since he was a child scoops him up as thoughtlessly as she would a puppy. Years later the affair takes a sharp turn when he announces that his mother has arranged for him to marry a suitable prospect with a significant dowry Edm̩e (Felicity Jones) an innocent who guilelessly upends this world." L̩a and Ch̩ri�۪s affair has left a great deal of wreckage in its seductive wake. It takes time to assess the damage and Mr. Frears working from Christopher Hampton�۪s intelligently compressed adaptation (the two were also united on the 1988 film ���Dangerous Liaisons�۝) seems in no hurry to break the bad news. Working with the cinematographer Darius Khondji and a host of other talented artisans he luxuriates in the Belle ��poque milieu with its sumptuous clothes gaudy homes and heavily bloomed gardens almost as self-indulgently as L̩a lounges in bed. The camera lingers over the silks and furs with an almost sentimental attachment." of course. And both are extremely gifted at what they do. What�۪s surprising at least at first is how eagerly Mr. Frears wants to please the audience or at least leave it untroubled. Though the film cannot rightly be characterized as soft ��� the cruel often funny verbal barbs invest it with pleasurable prickliness ��� there�۪s a certain reserve even hesitancy to his direction that in part may have something to do with the conundrum presented by Ms. Pfeiffer�۪s casting. After decades of pleasuring others L̩a now faces an empty bed a state of declining affairs that has taken on extra resonance in the story�۪s transposition from page to screen." and her success has largely rested on a combination of extraordinary looks and an underlying fragility that dilutes the threat that great beauty can bring with it. No matter the role with her watery eyes and slender limbs she often seems on the verge of breaking. She can seem as brittle as a twig and just as easy to snap. At other times you see the steeliness that comes with any sustained and successful movie career. In ���Ch̩ri�۝ you see the frailty and the strength yet you rarely experience either with the depth of feeling you might because of the palpable uneasiness surrounding her performance." as if she were a fine jewel in a shop window rather than a flesh-and-blood woman. Yet in flattering Ms. Pfeiffer he also ends up insulting her talent. Even a lingering close-up of her face which is meant to reveal how Ch̩ri suddenly sees L̩a in the harsh light of day backfires and not only because like most Hollywood stars of her age Ms. Pfeiffer looks all of 40. There�۪s something poignant about the image of this actress sitting in a pool of sunlight without a smile or trace of visible makeup. But she�۪s trying to reach a character that her director seems intent to keep from her grasp." based on the novels ���Ch̩ri�۝ and ���The Last of Ch̩ri�۝ by Colette; director of photography Darius Khondji; edited by Lucia Zucchetti; music by Alexandre Desplat; production designer Alan MacDonald; produced by Bill Kenwright.

�۝ the second blockbuster inspired by the popular Hasbro toys have segmented their demographic into four discrete categories:" viewers can embrace several categories at once; say those who collect toys and liked Mr. LaBeouf in the last ���Indiana Jones�۝ movie. Or those who fantasize about having sex with Ms. Fox while shooting guns a vision that distills the auteurist ambitions and popular appeal of the movie�۪s director Michael Bay." as conspicuously as that of Lars von Trier and every single one is inscribed with a specific worldview and moral sensibility. Mr. Bay�۪s subject ��� overwhelming violent conquest ��� is as blatant and consistent as his cluttered mise-en-sc̬ne. His images particularly during the frequent action sequences can be difficult to visually track but they are also consistently disjointed. (And proudly self-referential: the only director he overtly cites is himself with a shot of the poster for his movie ���Bad Boys II.�۝) The French filmmaker Jacques Rivette once described an auteur as someone who speaks in the first person. Mr. Bay prefers to shout." the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons hang out on Earth disguised as machines with cute nicknames mostly fast cars big rigs and military planes. The Autobot leader Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) usually rolls as a Peterbilt truck tricked out with shiny chrome and red painted flames while the car parked in Sam�۪s family garage a screaming if now voiceless yellow 2010 Camaro goes by Bumblebee. Every so often the aliens convert to their true shapes their articulated parts opening up like metallic origami." it�۪s no surprise that he plucks Sam out of school right after he cracks his first textbook. Along with his unlikely girlfriend Mikaela (Ms. Fox) Sam heads off to an adventure that reunites him with many of the first movie�۪s characters including an embarrassing John Turturro as Simmons who provides some wincingly unfunny comic relief and some military beefcake in the hardbody forms of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. Also back if not for long are the Autobots Ratchet (a Hummer H2) and Ironhide (a GMC TopKick pickup) which have suffered a fate more terminal at least to the brand than any meted out by the Decepticons: General Motors has sold Hummer and discontinued the TopKick." the illiterate bickering twins Skids (Tom Kenny) and Mudflap (Reno Wilson) both of which take the shape of Chevrolet concept cars. The characters have been given conspicuously cartoonish so-called black voices that indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when well Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas. For what it�۪s worth the script by Ehren Kruger Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman also includes a crack about Simmons who�۪s coded as Jewish and his ���pubic-fro head.�۝" of course just like there�۪s nothing to the reference to President Obama being whisked out of danger instead of standing tall like Optimus Prime and the rest of the robotic heroes. But that�۪s the perverse genius of Michael Bay. Despite the tediousness of his stories and inanity of his visual ideas he always manages to keep you laughing and shaking your head in disbelief at the outlandishness of his cinematic spectacles with their orange explosions armament fetishism and even their noxious stereotypes. The man just wears you out and wears you down so much so that it�۪s easy to pretend that you�۪re not ingesting 2 hours and 30 minutes of warmongering along with all that dumb fun." Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman based on Hasbro�۪s Transformers action figures; director of photography Ben Seresin; edited by Roger Barton Paul Rubell Joel Negron and Thomas Muldoon; music by Steve Jablonsky; production designer Nigel Phelps; visual effects and animation by Industrial Light & Magic; produced by Don Murphy Tom DeSanto Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Ian Bryce; released by DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures.

�۝ Jerry Lewis or some other professional wisenheimer once said ���is a man in trouble.�۝ In Harold Ramis�۪s ���Year One �۝ a thoroughly sometimes gaggingly broad and sly conceptual laugh-in laced-with-jokes  ��� about God poop circumcision female underarm hair and the state of Israel ���  comedy is two men dressed in animal skins and neck deep in shtick. Set in what looks like a succession of B-movie studio sets the film brings to mind a Hope and Crosby road movie though only if Bob and Bing after studying the Bible as children and reading Nietzsche as adults were grappling with issues of faith." the two hit a surrealistic road that takes them from the forest to the desert with stops along the prehistory and history continuum. Before they depart however Zed bites into a golden apple he plucks from the forbidden tree of knowledge a defiant act that awakens his mind. ���Everything is weird �۝ he declares with philosophical purity. Not long after he is down on his hands and knees sampling human scat." in which theological questions are smuggled in between silly bits about excrement and body hair. Much as Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner did with the 2 000 Year Old Man Mr. Ramis who wrote the screenplay with Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg is playing with history or rather with the serious stories familiar from religious instruction and Hollywood epics. ���Is it true that you were at the scene of the Crucifixion some 2 000 years ago?�۝ Mr. Reiner asks the 2 000 Year Old Man. ���Oh boy! I knew Christ �۝ Mr. Brooks replies. ���Thin lad. Always wore sandals. Hung around with 12 other guys. They came in the store no one ever bought anything. Once they asked for water.�۝" which take them first to a meadow where they meet two pastoral types one of whom has a really bad attitude. That would be Cain (David Cross) who�۪s soon brutally whaling on his brother Abel (Paul Rudd). (���You want some of that?�۝) Er spoiler alert! Cain kills Abel beating him to death with a rock. Mr. Ramis stages the murder with so many (off-screen) blows that the scene rapidly morphs from funny to queasily humorous to just plain unpleasant before rebounding to the uneasily comic. Mr. Ramis likes to push humor to its tasteless edge but the violence here feels almost personal as if he were wielding that rock." �۝ which as Zed and Oh amble through different historical periods and Bible stories takes knowing and often profane swats at the sacred. Cain proves to be a real pest (a nice observation on the persistence of evil) and things go from bad to worse. Zed and Oh are sold into slavery and marched across the desert by Romans with British accents. They escape only to inadvertently persuade Abraham (Hank Azaria wearing a long glued-on beard) not to slay Isaac (Christopher  Mintz-Plasse). Jokes about snipped foreskins and the Holy Land�۪s borders ensue as does a trip to Sodom leading to an assortment of predictable if unprintable puns and yuks." Part I �۝ Mr. Brooks revisits the past starting with the dawn of hirsute man and ending with the French Revolution tossing in some religious broadsides along the way. Mr. Ramis by contrast fashions a seamless narrative from Zed and Oh�۪s adventures jettisoning the usual time frames associated with these foundation stories to create something of an ahistorical collage. In this film Stone Age man walks alongside Roman centurions and heroes and villains from the Old Testament which suggests that when Mr. Ramis hasn�۪t been listening to old comedy routines he�۪s been boning up on the debate about evolution versus creationism. Riffing on the movie�۪s title: in the beginning there were multiple beginnings each good for lots of laughs." tasteless groaningly goofy and irresistible though I wish the filmmakers had resisted the temptation to sacrifice for an unnecessary gag a Sodomite priest (Oliver Platt) who had taken a liking to Oh. By that point the film has run out of steam having mined various B-movie clich̩s (the kind in which prehistoric women wear eyeliner) and even taken a time out for a discourse on God. I would like to think that the final scene which finds Mr. Ramis playing Noah and sending Zed and Oh off with female mates was a lazy afterthought simply an admission of how the past was written. Here�۪s hoping that in ���Year Two�۝ the Stone Age finally gives way to Stonewall." Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg based on a story by Mr. Ramis; director of photography Alar Kivilo; edited by Craig P. Herring and Steve Welch; music by Theodore Shapiro; production designer Jefferson Sage; produced by Mr. Ramis Judd Apatow and Clayton Townsend; released by Columbia Pictures.

Their deliberate pacing and the decorous rhythms of the dialogue might charitably be described as classical given the picture�۪s occasional evocation of a Broadway-to-Hollywood adaptation from the 1930s. A less generous word might be sloppy given the near-total absence of the kind of Lubitschean verve of which Mr. Allen when he�۪s on his comic game is capable." a formerly eminent physicist named Boris Yelnikoff.

She is a homeless Southern waif who follows Boris home one rainy night and despite his loudly and repeatedly professed lack of interest in her feelings her opinions her long legs or her short shorts falls in love with him.

���The Proposal �۝ Sandra Bullock playing a Type A (rhymes with) witch totters around in a pair of exquisite high heels the kind that elongate the legs and give a woman�۪s derri̬re the gentle backward thrust familiar from fertility figurines. The character a no-nonsense no-smiling publishing executive otherwise favors an aerodynamic look (pencil skirts and ponytails) but the heels betray her. They throw a curve into her straight line and force her to tilt sway and wobble. She might be the mistress ��� the harsh and exacting mistress ��� of her universe but she�۪s clearly been prepped for a fall." ���The Proposal�۝ is all about bringing a woman to her knees quite literally in this case. The simple premise is partly telegraphed in the advertising tag line ���Here comes the bribe �۝ which evokes wedding bells and desperation. One day at the office Margaret Tate (Ms. Bullock) a Canadian who�۪s let her visa expire suddenly finds herself scrambling for a way to stay in the United States and the big New York office where she rules with an iron fist clutching a designer bag. She finds the means to her salvation yes in more ways than one in the pleasant form of her assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) a beleaguered Guy Friday who slavishly attends to many of her needs." Andrew will soon be attending to Margaret�۪s other desires of course. Overlong story short: Margaret blackmails Andrew into a sham marriage proposal in exchange for a promotion. He agrees though only after making her kneel on the sidewalk. They fly to a cute little town in Alaska where she discovers his family lives on its own island in a mansion picturesquely surrounded by mountains. You can�۪t see Russia from the front door but there are loads of amenities if remarkably no visible hired help. Mom (Mary Steenburgen) and Dad (Craig T. Nelson) are on hand as is Grandma Annie (Betty White) the resident unfunny old-lady kook who�۪s about to turn 90 and could use a little face time with a big pillow." Margaret melts. He mans the ramparts she lowers her defenses. He thrusts she parries. He chops wood and loses his shirt. She loses her cellphone and ditches the heels. He rescues her scooping her out of the water after she falls from a boat. She shivers and smiles and tears up as she talks about her tragic past revealing the sad little girl who�۪s long been hidden behind the cruel disguise of a sensationally successful professional adult. Ding-dong the witch is soon dead and in her place well here comes the bride." whose last gig was the similarly obnoxious ���27 Dresses.�۝ Working from a script by Peter Chiarelli Ms. Fletcher betrays no originality from behind the camera and not a hint of visual facility. The opening scenes including shots of Andrew rushing through the streets while balancing coffee cups are right out of ���The Devil Wears Prada �۝ minus the snap. The scene in which Margaret runs around naked is borrowed from ���Something�۪s Gotta Give �۝ though here the point isn�۪t that desirability transcends age but that at 44 Ms. Bullock still has an amazing body. The rest of the movie looks like many industrial entertainments of this type: it�۪s decently lighted and as lived in as a magazine advertisement." who excels at playing spunky is as appealing as usual but the role proves as awkward as those heels. (Mr. Reynolds is equally likable though more decorative than anything else.) She�۪s always been better in fundamentally independent roles that allow her to grab the wheel (���Speed�۝) and take the spotlight (the ���Miss Congeniality�۝ flicks) an independence that persists all the way through the last-act coupling. She can smile as brightly at a man as well as the next leading lady though like all genuinely big female stars she�۪s really more of a solo act. Certainly she�۪s no shrew in need of taming. She�۪s just another female movie star in need of a vehicle that won�۪t throw her overboard for sexist giggles and laughs." ���Show her who�۪s boss.�۝ Enough said."

�۝ Bertolucci�۪s 1970 film about the moral corruption and aesthetic decadence of Italy under Mussolini the French actor Jean-Louis Trintignant laid bare some of the psychological dimensions of the Fascist personality with a sinister precision rarely matched before or since. Admirers of that performance will find a precedent in ���Le Combat dans l�۪�_le �۝ a curious and fascinating French film from 1962 in which Mr. Trintignant in effect rehearses in his native language the creepy and seductive mixture of sadism and insecurity he would translate into Italian eight years later." �۝ directed by Alain Cavalier and produced by Louis Malle Mr. Trintignant plays Cl̩ment a factory owner�۪s son who is involved with a clandestine group of right-wing militants. Their ultimate aims are mysterious but this small armed cadre is disciplined and serious enough to plot the assassination of a prominent politician and to acquire for that task a bazooka which finds its way into Cl̩ment�۪s coat closet." Anne played with heart-stopping capriciousness by Romy Schneider who was never lovelier and who is capable of distracting everyone in the film and the audience above all from whatever grave political matters are afoot." allegorical or merely atmospheric can be difficult to assess. There is no doubt that the ambiguous shadow of France�۪s experience in World War II lingered into the early 1960s and beyond and that tremors of domestic social unrest and war in Algeria can be discerned hovering outside the somber elegant frames of this film. But it also seems that the movie�۪s main source of energy lies elsewhere in the electromagnetic forces of desire jealousy violence and cinema itself." slightly demented freedom from Paris to the countryside from political thriller to romantic melodrama. Cl̩ment cold and domineering with his wife nonetheless expresses a kind of neurotic devotion to her and holds onto her loyalty despite (or perhaps by means of) his icy volatility. Until that is he entrusts her to the care of his old friend Paul a printer who lives in a charming  mill and a state of equally alluring bohemian bachelor rusticity." and the contrast between him and Cl̩ment would hardly be clearer if ���Le Combat dans l�۪�_le�۝ were a superhero comic book. Large and loose-limbed with flowing dark hair and a warm rugged full-featured face Mr. Serre is a perfect visual foil for the fair compact tightly wound Mr. Trintignant. And the temperamental differences between their characters seem to follow from these physical traits. Paul is a natural democrat with easy manners and an intuitive appreciation for both hard work and honest pleasure while Cl̩ment is punctilious and intolerant perverted by his own self-repressing will and his unacknowledged guilt." like Anne gravitates toward Paul there is sympathy left for Cl̩ment partly because Mr. Trintignant never loses sight of this foolish angry young man�۪s essential humanity. Of the three though it is Anne who emerges as the most interesting character since she is less burdened with symbolic and ideological baggage than the two rivals for her affection." �۝ it is nonetheless intriguing and absorbing ��� and also thanks to Pierre Lhomme�۪s silvery and smoky cinematography and the natural gorgeousness of the cast ���  beautiful to behold."

Mr. Berkowitz the musician Michael Callen and the virologist Dr. Joseph Sonnabend (whom Mr. Berkowitz describes as his Moses) were among the first public voices to promote protected sex strenuously  and warn against unbridled promiscuity.

nonorganic popcorn at the concession stand. That at least is one of the unappetizing lessons to draw from one of the scariest movies of the year ���Food Inc. �۝ an informative often infuriating activist documentary about the big business of feeding or more to the political point force-feeding Americans all the junk that multinational corporate money can buy. You�۪ll shudder shake and just possibly lose your genetically modified lunch." to borrow a loaded agribusiness phrase  ���  the movie is nothing if not ambitious. ���There are no seasons in the American supermarket �۝ the unidentified voice intones in the opening scene as the camera sweeps the aisles of one such brightly lighted heavily stocked if nutritionally impoverished emporium. From there the director Robert Kenner jumps all over the  food  map from industrial feedlots where millions of cruelly crammed cattle mill about in their own waste until slaughter to the  chains where millions of consumers gobble down industrially produced meat and an occasional serving of E. coli bacteria." author of ���In Defense of Food�۝ and ���The Omnivore�۪s Dilemma �۝ as well as a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine. (Somewhat confusingly the movie uses voice-overs without clearly identifying who�۪s issuing forth on the soundtrack.) Mr. Pollan who periodically appears on screen seated at a homey-looking table is a great strength of ���Food Inc. �۝ as is one of its co-producers Eric Schlosser the author of ���Fast Food Nation.�۝ These two embodiments of conscience together with Mr. Kenner chart how and why the villains not only outnumber the heroes in contemporary food production but also how and why they outbluff outmuscle and outspend their opponents by billions of often government-subsidized dollars." �۝ you won�۪t be surprised by what the movie shows and tells about the killing floors and soybean fields. Chances are that you�۪ll still be appalled which is to Mr. Kenner�۪s credit. Much as Mr. Schlosser does in ���Fast Food Nation �۝ the movie takes a look at the animal abuse in industrial food production  ���  including clandestine images of  sick and crippled cows being prodded to join the rest of the ill-fated herd  ���  but its main focus is on the human cost. It�۪s a cost visible in the rounded bodies of a poor family that eats cheap if filling fast-food burgers for breakfast and in the obscured faces of farmers too frightened to go on record about Monsanto the agricultural biotech giant." including bushels of statistics a veritable village of talking heads and too many dopey graphics he makes the case that there�۪s something horribly wrong with a system in which a bag of chips cost less than a bag of carrots. It�۪s such a good case that you soon realize there are a dozen more documentaries tucked inside this one. The section on Monsanto is particularly eye-opening and could be spun out in more detail. And I could have spent more time with the philosophizing organic farmer Joel Salatin who guts his chickens al fresco hails his free-ranging livestock (���Hey pig!�۝) and is a reality show waiting to happen. It could be called ���Hello and Goodbye Pig!�۝" in the end something inherently frustrating about a movie that�۪s at once as fine ambitious and at a crisp 93 minutes as abbreviated as ���Food Inc.�۝ Time and again the movie stops short before it really gets started as with the debates over the big business of organic food. The moment when an organic farmer cheerily tells a smiling Wal-Mart representative that her family has been boycotting the company for years is hilarious. But it�۪s also over before the issues have really been thrashed through.

�۝ a visually lush cinematic fugue about love ambivalence and two brothers fleeing the dark shadow of their domineering father a world-famous conductor ���  through the lens of autobiography. But like much of this movie the lens appears clouded. Mr. Coppola�۪s father Carmine who died in 1991 was a rather less celebrated musician best known for some of the scores for his youngest son�۪s films including ���The Godfather: Part II�۝ and ���Apocalypse Now.�۝ Then again the ravenous larger-than-life patriarch in ���Tetro�۝ could also be a self-portrait of the director." in the first two ���Godfather�۝ movies with their instances of symbolic and literal fratricide and in the autobiographically inflected ���Rumble Fish �۝ which he dedicated to his older brother August. ���Tetro�۝ largely turns on the relationship between a 17-year-old Bennie (the fine newcomer Alden Ehrenreich) and his much older brother the anguished title character (Vincent Gallo decoratively sullen) a cosmopolitan type who�۪s fled his homeland (fatherland) for an old-fashioned bohemian existence in Buenos Aires marked by late mornings caf̩ idylls colorful characters and erotic pleasures. These latter needs seem mainly provided by his live-in lover Miranda (Maribel Verd̼) a vague warm presence who embodies the sensual and the maternal." one Mr. Coppola has summoned up with great visual beauty. The movie was shot in widescreen in lustrous black-and-white digital video with bursts of color by Mihai Malaimare Jr. the cinematographer for Mr. Coppola�۪s previous feature ���Youth Without Youth.�۝ (���Rumble Fish�۝ was also shot in black and white with splashes of color.) Mr. Coppola has cited Elia Kazan�۪s films like ���On the Waterfront�۝ as one inspiration for his new movie�۪s striking high-contrast visuals an influence that also reverberates in the brooding tensions between the brothers who at times bring to mind those in Kazan�۪s ���East of Eden.�۝ While shooting ���The Godfather �۝ it seems worth mentioning Mr. Coppola had nightmares that he was going to be replaced by Kazan." where an image of Robert Mitchum from ���The Night of the Hunter�۝ ��� the words love and hate tattooed on his hands ��� glowers down from a wall. The family theme echoes even here; in that eccentric 1955 classic Mitchum plays a preacher who tracks the two children of a woman he�۪s married and murdered. The patriarchal damage in Mr. Coppola�۪s movie is somewhat subtler the work of a man Carlo Tetrocini (Klaus Maria Brandauer) who has crippled the dreams of his own brother another composer (Mr. Brandauer heavily disguised) and the sanity of his older son. Tetro may have renounced his father but he can�۪t shake him in spirit or name." much like Mr. Coppola�۪s own filmmaking past the old man looms. Hollywood haunts ���Tetro�۝ just as Carlo haunts his sons. Eschewing the inexorable forward thrust of most contemporary studio products Mr. Coppola working from his own screenplay ��� his first original one since ���The Conversation�۝ in 1974 ��� drifts and circles around his themes much as Bennie and Tetro amble around town. Tetro we discover is a genius or would be if he ever completed his work an aside that�۪s funny and tragic though it�۪s unclear if it�۪s meant to be both. One of the many themes that surfaces elliptically if stubbornly is the pressure family exerts on genius or maybe vice versa a topic that�۪s imprinted on the Coppola Family Saga." though mostly what rises to the fore are moods and feelings and the heavy silences that drive wedges among even the closest of intimates. The sense of heaviness is partly due to the dark imagery as well as the intentionally artificial somewhat leaden sound work by Walter Murch Mr. Coppola�۪s longtime editor and sound guru. Resolutely nonrealistic  ��� or rather nongeneric Hollywood ���  the audio adds greatly to the movie�۪s unreality to the sense that we�۪re watching (experiencing) someone else�۪s dream or nightmare. Every word of dialogue and chair scrape sounds as if it had been separately recorded and the usual atmospheric noise ��� the ambient filler that gives movies their spark of artificial life ��� has gone provocatively missing." �۝ sometimes powerfully sometimes obscurely. Filled with incidents (a well-timed broken leg a production of ���Faust�۝) and diversions (a powerful critic named Alone played with an inscrutable smile by Carmen Maura) and a few glorious peeks at the soaring Patagonian mountains the movie finds Mr. Coppola stretching beyond the mainstream conventions that have alternately liberated and constrained him for more than four decades of filmmaking. As with ���Youth Without Youth �۝ this new movie feels like a transitional work but also an inspired one the creation of a director who having recently turned 70 has set off on a new adventure that requires more from his audiences than some might be willing to give.

�۝ a movie about some of the violent convulsions rocking contemporary China occurs when a building shudders into the air like a space shuttle. The image is never explained on screen and seems at odds with the movie�۪s overriding realism which nonetheless also makes room for what looks like a U.F.O. Yet these alien images make sense given the dislocating otherworldly strangeness of Chinese existence charted by the filmmaker Jia Zhang-ke in ���Still Life�۝ and elsewhere. ���I think �۝ he said in a recent interview in Film Comment ���surrealism is a crucial part of China�۪s reality.�۝" ���24 City �۝ despite the vaguely science-fiction title. An experimental fiction-nonfiction hybrid it takes place in the southwest city of Chengdu the capital of Sichuan Province. (It was shot before  last year�۪s  catastrophic  earthquake.) The focus is a state-owned factory building a ruined monument to precapitalist China or rather to its workers who helped turn the country into a global power. Mr. Jia managed to catch the sprawling colloquially named Factory 420  ���  which originally manufactured fighter aircraft engines before branching out to refrigerators and the like  ���  as it was being demolished to make room for a mixed-use development that will spread across 3.3 million square feet house 60 000 residents and include an eight-screen multiplex that is unlikely to show his work." though it�۪s hard to believe that his movies with their lengthy takes and generous silences will ever attract a popular audience of any nationality. Given his rarefied style it was instructive to read in a recent New Yorker profile that Mr. Jia has been criticized by some Chinese intellectuals for ���abandoning his most subversive themes.�۝ This criticism might be due to the fact that Mr. Jia who once flew under the government�۪s radar now shoots his movies with its official approval. Or that the state-owned company that redeveloped the factory also helped pay for ���24 City.�۝ Whatever the case Mr. Jia doesn�۪t seem to have sold out for the state�۪s blessing at least as far as  this Westerner can tell." even across the divide that often separates one country�۪s critics from another country�۪s filmmakers is Mr. Jia�۪s increasing restlessness or perhaps frustration with some of the narrative strategies he has used in the past. His earlier films including ���The World�۝ (2004) a fiction about workers at a theme  park that features small-scale replicas of the Pyramids along with the twin towers can scarcely be called mainstream. Yet these documentary-inflected works with their drifting characters and ambiguities also fit into a recognizable art-cinema continuum. When a woman walks down a hall during an extended traveling shot in ���The World �۝ you�۪re not just watching her on a long march to nowhere; you�۪re also watching a scene signed by an auteur." �۝ in the Yeats poetry that spills down the screen as text and in the mesmerizing image of workers leaving the factory a likely homage to an  1895 short by the French film pioneers Louis and Auguste Lumi̬re. Mr. Jia�۪s own movie  ���  he shifted from celluloid to digital video a while ago  ���  includes four monologues delivered by professional actors which are interspersed with five interviews with nonactors most of whom worked in the factory. Mixed in with these true and false witnesses are images  of the closing and derelict factory and of the city beyond. A few people also presumably nonactors pass by including a girl roller-skating in tight circles on a roof." and between people and places is at once immersive and distancing. Because the names of Joan Chen and the Jia regular Zhao Tao appear in the opening credits I understood the first time I watched the movie that they were delivering performances. But I was uncertain about most of the other people even though Mr. Jia does include images of some workers on old identity cards. There�۪s something slightly disorienting about a work that doesn�۪t have the usual markers that assure you that now you�۪re watching a fiction now you�۪re watching a documentary which as I realized on second viewing can work beautifully for a movie about profound dislocation." but it�۪s also dramatically potent. The actors in ���24 City�۝ bring their own existential realities to their short touching performances. In the end the deep emotions they stir up  ���  the actress Lv Liping delivers a harrowing story about a lost child  ���  constitute another kind of monument to the workers of Factory 420.

Uhde an early patron of Picasso and Braque was also famous for having discovered and popularized the work of Rousseau a Belgian customs officer whose vibrant and exotic paintings seemed to come from nowhere and find their way to the very center of modern consciousness.

This is partly thanks to the three principal actors Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis who incarnate familiar masculine stereotypes in ways that manage to be moderately fresh as well as soothingly familiar." nerdy dude ��� a dentist only because making him an accountant would deprive the film of a choice tooth-extraction gag ��� who lives in cowering terror of his bossy judgmental girlfriend (Rachel Harris). Mr. Galifianakis is the childlike loser whose borderline-creepy non sequiturs are more hilarious the less sense they make. But it is Mr. Cooper who offers the most interesting variation on an old standard playing his aggressive cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss." Phil (Mr. Cooper) and Alan (Mr. Galifianakis) ��� drive to Las Vegas from Los Angeles with another buddy Doug (Justin Bartha) who seems much better adjusted than the others which is to say blander and duller and who mercifully vanishes for most of the picture.

Stu and Alan wake up to find their luxury suite at Caesars Palace a shambles with a tiger in the bathroom a baby in the closet and a chicken scratching around the detritus of what looks to have been quite a bacchanal. Stu has a missing incisor Phil has a hospital bracelet around his wrist and Doug is nowhere to be found. What on earth could have happened?" since even the craziest stuff has a way of becoming less so in the course of being explained. Still there are some moments of dizzying demented lunacy most of them immune to being spoiled by mere verbal description. (The verbal jokes I will leave for you to discover and repeat with your co-workers in the break room.)"

Far from being screw-ups Verona and Burt played with passive-aggressive winsomeness by Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski are manifestly superior to everyone else in the movie and by implication the world." it�۪s clear that they are acutely at times painfully aware of their special status as uniquely sensitive caring smart and cool beings on a planet full of cretins and failures." directed by Sam Mendes from a script by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida takes a while to register partly because Ms. Rudolph and Mr. Krasinski are appealing and unaffected performers and partly because the writing has some humor and charm. The opening scene which finds the couple in bed is disarmingly sweet and candid in its depiction of the sexual rapport of longtime lovers. There is real intimacy and affection between them which is wonderful until before too long it becomes as insufferable as the songs by Alexi Murdoch which similarly wear out their rueful faux-na��ve welcome." cute premise. The parents-to-be need to find a suitable place to raise their daughter and their search gives them an opportunity to visit friends and relatives and to collect the nuggets of grievance and disappointment that fuel their search for perfect happiness." and their dinner table display of selfishness kicks off a transcontinental parade of bad child-rearing. A visit to Lily (Allison Janney) a former boss of Verona�۪s who lives in Phoenix reveals a tableau of vulgar suburban dysfunction: fat sullen kids; wildly inappropriate language; daytime drinking;  and free-floating political paranoia (courtesy of Lily�۪s husband played by Jim Gaffigan)." a bit later by a family in Madison Wis. whose matriarch L N a gender studies professor played by Maggie Gyllenhaal is a soft-spoken medusa of political correctness and New Age malarkey." which gives the film�۪s comic moments a bullying self-righteous tone." with a special emphasis on maternal instincts gone awry." there is a mom who has fled and another whose adopted brood can�۪t compensate for her inability to bear children. And then there is Verona�۪s sister (Carmen Ejogo) whose boyfriend is such an evident loser that he can�۪t even make it onto the screen alongside the marvelous Burt." he and Verona glow with a modesty that only adds luster to their many other virtues.

But the dream of being left alone in a world of your own making far from anything sad or icky or difficult is a child�۪s fantasy.

Philip Gourevitch author of the definitive English-language book on the 1994 Rwandan genocide wrote about that country�۪s progress 15 years after the killing toward national reconciliation and political  normalcy. ���Munyurangabo �۝ a quiet probing film by Lee Isaac Chung that was first shown at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival examines similar themes in a different key using the fine-grained techniques of cinematic neorealism to illuminate the psychological and emotional landscape of a still-traumatized place." Munyurangabo (Jeff Rutagengwa) and Sangwa (Eric Ndorunkundiye) as they make their way from Kigali the Rwandan capital to the farm where Sangwa�۪s parents live. The companionship between the travelers seems easy and friendly enough but it is also shadowed by suspicion and by a sense of unspoken and perhaps unacknowledged tension. The symbol of this and of the horrors that lie somewhere in the recent past is the machete that Munyurangabo takes with him on the road." which Mr. Chung wrote with Samuel Anderson (with dialogue mostly improvised by the nonprofessional actors) allows weighty themes of vengeance justice and forgiveness to hover around the characters and their actions rather than trying to dramatize them too pointedly. As a result ���Munyurangabo�۝ at times drifts from oblique understatement toward inscrutability and vagueness." bringing home the sensual and material reality of Rwanda a  country that functions for many in the West as a near-abstraction a synonym for unimaginable cruelty. Unlike Terry George�۪s earnestly melodramatic ���Hotel Rwanda �۝ Mr. Chung�۪s film the first narrative feature in the Kinyarwandan language leaves the violence off screen and in the past. But the enormity of the 1994 massacres ��� during which at least 800 000 Tutsis and dissident Hutus were killed many by their own neighbors acting on the orders of the Hutu nationalist government ��� is if anything underscored by the absence of graphic physical evidence." and you are forced to contemplate how this village this farm this road could have witnessed so much killing. And of course you also wonder what the people you encounter members of the older generation in particular were doing 15 years ago. The hope for a new more harmonious Rwanda is represented by a poet Edouard B. Uwayo whose verses somehow convey everything that cannot be shown on film or said in the course of everyday conversation." it trusts that the implications of its intimate almost anecdotal narrative will resonate in spite of its humble methods. But there is also an arresting audacity in a young American filmmaker�۪s attempt to tackle the raw and complicated reality of Rwanda and what is most impressive is the care with which Mr. Chung manages this risky undertaking. He seems to have made this film above all by listening and looking." directed and edited by Lee Isaac Chung; written by Samuel Anderson and Mr. Chung; director of photography Mr. Chung; music by Claire Wibabara; art director Jean Kwezi; released by Film Movement.

�۝ a muddle of moods and intentions. The British comic actor Steve Coogan plays Campbell Babbitt a flailing depressed journalist who�۪s sent to New Hampshire in the mid-1980s  to write an article pegged to the imminent liftoff of Christa McAuliffe the high school teacher who was part of the Challenger space mission." who happened to be one of Campbell�۪s old college friends. Although largely indifferent to the teenagers other than as potential story material he does take notice of two beauties Lucy (Hilary Duff) and Tess (Olivia Thirlby) who wear their angst as unsuccessfully as their black New Wave clothes." it becomes increasingly unclear what story the first-time feature director Jonathan Glatzer is trying to tell and whose. Based on a play he wrote with  Robert Lawson the movie lurches from melodramatic pathos (Campbell has a tragic back story) to broad satire (the high school is putting on an absurd space-theme musical) to unproductive end as each new tonal shift erodes whatever narrative coherence and momentum Mr. Glatzer has managed to establish. At times he seems to be trying to say something critical about America and heroism (the cartoonish musical suggests as much); at other times he appears to be embracing the very values he previously lampooned." the antagonism that comes to a boil between Campbell and Tess gives the film some bristling tension. Mr. Coogan doesn�۪t seem altogether comfortable with his part which like the story undergoes a number of unconvincing changes. And it�۪s painful to watch him try to feign interest in Ms. Duff miscast as a misfit object of desire. (Ms. Thirlby meanwhile assumes that unscripted role by virtue of her smoky eyes and glower.) Yet even when Mr. Coogan  can�۪t  make his scenes work his prickly  presence keeps you watching as does the eerie scenes of winter that Mr. Glatzer captures with the camera." Antonio Calvache; edited by Mr. Glatzer and Jennifer Godin; music by Roddy Bottum; production designer Tony Devenyi; produced by Jack Nasser R D Robb and Mr. Glatzer; released by  Three Kings Production.

borne aloft by a sense of creative flight and a flawlessly realized love story. Its on-screen and unlikely escape artist is Carl Fredricksen a widower and former balloon salesman with a square head and a round nose that looks ready for honking. Voiced with appreciable impatience by Ed Asner Carl isn�۪t your typical American animated hero. He�۪s 78 for starters and the years have taken their toll on his lugubrious body and spirit both of which seem solidly tethered to the ground. Even the two corners of his mouth point straight down. It�۪s as if he were sagging into the earth." where they go up up and away and off to an adventure in South America with a portly child some talking (and snarling and gourmet-cooking) dogs and an unexpected villain. Though the initial images of flight are wonderfully rendered ��� the house shudders and creaks and splinters and groans as it�۪s ripped from its foundation by the balloons ��� the movie remains bound by convention despite even its modest 3-D depth. This has become the Pixar way. Passages of glorious imagination are invariably matched by stock characters and banal story choices as each new movie becomes another manifestation of the movie-industry divide between art and the bottom line." which tell Carl�۪s story with extraordinary tenderness and brilliant narrative economy and the later scenes of him as a geriatric action hero. The movie opens with the young Carl enthusing over black-and-white newsreel images of his hero a world-famous aviator and explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Shortly thereafter Carl meets Ellie a plucky would-be adventurer who a few edits later becomes his beloved wife an adult relationship that the director Pete Docter brilliantly compresses into some four wordless minutes during which the couple dream together face crushing disappointment and grow happily old side by side. Like the opener of ���Wall-E�۝ and the critic�۪s Proustian reminiscence of childhood in ���Ratatouille �۝ this is filmmaking at its purest." with whom he wrote the screenplay are looking back to the silent era as Andrew Stanton did with the Chaplinesque start to ���Wall-E.�۝ Even so partly because ���Up�۝ includes a newsreel interlude its marriage sequence also brings to mind the breakfast table in ���Citizen Kane.�۝ In this justly famous (talking) montage Orson Welles shows the collapse of a marriage over a number of years through a series of images of Kane and his first wife seated across from each other at breakfast another portrait of a marriage in miniature. As in their finest work the Pixar filmmakers have created thrilling cinema simply by rifling through its history." Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently hitches a ride with Carl forcing the old man to assume increasingly grandfatherly duties. But before that happens there are glories to savor notably the scenes of Carl ��� having decided to head off on the kind of adventure Ellie and he always postponed ��� taking to the air. When the multihued balloons burst through the top of his wooden house it�۪s as if a thousand gloriously unfettered thoughts had bloomed above his similarly squared head. Especially lovely is the image of a little girl jumping in giddy delight as the house rises in front of her large picture window the sunlight through the balloons daubing her room with bright color." an irritant whose Botero proportions recall those of the human dirigibles in ���Wall-E �۝ float to South America where they the house and the movie come down to earth. Though Mr. Docter�۪s visual imagination shows no signs of strain here ��� the image of Carl stubbornly pulling his house now tethered to his torso could have come out of the illustrated Freud ��� the story grows progressively more formulaic. And cuter. Carl comes face to face with his childhood hero Muntz an eccentric with the dashing looks and frenetic energy of a younger Kirk Douglas. Muntz lives with a legion of talking dogs with which he has been hunting a rare bird whose gaudy plumage echoes the palette of Carl�۪s balloons." including the slobbering yellow furball Dug  and a squeaky-voiced Doberman Alpha (both Mr. Peterson) not to mention the dog in the kitchen and the one that pops open the Champagne. And there�۪s something to be said about the revelation that heroes might not be what you imagined particularly in a children�۪s movie and particularly one released by Disney. (Muntz seems partly inspired by Charles Lindbergh at his most heroic and otherwise.) But much like Russell the little boy with father problems and much like Dug the dog with master issues the story starts to feel ingratiating enough to warrant a kick. O.K. O.K. not a kick just some gently expressed regret." but nothing inappropriate for any viewer of any age."

�۝ a small Canadian horror film that makes the most of its minuscule budget is set almost entirely in the confines of a tiny radio station that operates from a church basement in rural Ontario. (The film�۪s title is also the name of the village that is home to the station CLSY Radio.) Here Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie) a growling talk-show cowboy who suggests a bottom-drawer Don Imus holds forth each morning while swigging heavily spiked coffee. By his side are his producer Sydney Briar (Lisa Houle) with whom he continually bickers and Laurel Ann Drummond (Georgina Reilly) a resourceful technician who recently returned from serving in Afghanistan." �۝ the film captures the monotonous daily rituals of broadcasting from inside a studio that feels so sealed off from the outside world that nothing beyond the sound booth seems real. On this snowy Valentine�۪s Day morning phoned-in reports of grisly events in the town seem as bogus as the Sunshine Chopper a fictional traffic helicopter that is actually a truck parked on a hill."

�۝ two exceptionally strong runners-up in that category should not take their disappointment out on Mr. Takita�۪s entry which  doesn�۪t require comparison  with those two formally innovative thematically daring films. It is perfectly mediocre all on its own." predictable in its plotting and utterly banal in its blending of comic whimsy and melodramatic pathos ���Departures�۝ is in the end interesting mainly as an index of the Academy�۪s hopelessly timid and conventional tastes. It operates from start to finish in a zone of emotional safety touching on strong feelings like grief and loss without really engaging them and wrapping itself in a protective membrane of tastefulness. Aided by the classical and pseudo-classical music that decorates the soundtrack Mr. Takita an auteur of Japanese soft-core ���pink�۝ cinema before he turned to more prestigious projects has made a soft pretty film streaked with just enough perversity to give it a vague coloration of art." the smooth-faced protagonist is a professional cellist who loses his job when his orchestra goes bankrupt.  He and his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) return to his hometown and move into the small shut-down bar Daigo�۪s mother used to run. She has been dead for a few years and the whereabouts of Daigo�۪s father who walked out on the family when Daigo was a young boy are unknown." once the contours of the story (written by Kundo Koyama) become clear. Desperate for work Daigo answers an advertisement and takes a job assisting Mr. Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) a gruff old fellow who is in the business of preparing dead bodies for burial. The disreputable nature of this work makes Daigo something of a pariah even to Mika who can�۪t bear to think that the potential father of her children might earn his keep handling corpses." though that the ritual of washing and enrobing those bodies is  a rigorous dignified craft and a source of solace for the bereaved. This is so clear indeed that whatever dramatic tension ���Departures�۝ might have had is almost immediately stifled. Daigo is such a nice hard-working young man and his mentor is so evidently kindly and wise that you never really believe that anyone could hold their vocations against them." and some well-observed local details and a few interestingly eccentric minor characters.

(There are no Israelis in the film.)" ���Laila�۪s Birthday �۝ which begins a one-week engagement at the Museum of Modern Art on Wednesday isn�۪t an anguished political broadside but a fleet dark urban comedy that registers outrage in glancing jabs of absurdist observation. Its examination of ordinary Palestinians going about their business in a city under siege with checkpoints on the ground and helicopters above maintains a wry detachment until the moment late in the film when Abu Laila�۪s composure briefly cracks and he delivers a tirade to the cosmos and to everyone within earshot."
