it should be said. Mr. Madden�۪s knack for swift and intricate drama has shown itself before in films as varied as ���Shakespeare in Love�۝ and ���Proof �۝ but those movies also show the tendency toward glibness that undermines ���The Debt.�۝ Vogel�۪s confinement in the Mossad agents�۪ apartment is the result of an airtight plan disrupted by chance human fallibility and the sheer messiness of experience. But that is precisely what the film with its narrowly construed range of ethical choices and emotional conundrums works to exclude. It errs if anything on the side of professionalism turning a tale full of sticky political implications and emotional undercurrents into a neat sequence of plot twists." �۝ John Madden�۪s remake of a 2007 Israeli thriller shuttles back and forth between a dim creaky East Berlin apartment in 1965 and the sunshine of elite Tel Aviv a little more than 30 years later. The film written by Matthew Vaughn Jane Goldman and Peter Straughan is interested in the ways that the truth of the past can be shaded and illuminated by the imperatives of the present and it probes with perhaps more energy than clarity the ethical and psychological complications that can lie hidden beneath a story of simple heroism." or the effects of a hidden truth they have worked hard to repress. As ���The Debt�۝ grows more complex and suspenseful it also becomes more literal losing some of its dramatic intensity. The claustrophobic unspoken bonds and rivalries that link Rachel David and Stephan in their younger and older incarnations are overshadowed by Vogel and everything he represents and a finely observed study of desire under duress gives way to a breathless and pedestrian globe-trotting thriller." heroic story has to do with what happened in cold war Berlin where three Mossad operatives went on a secret mission to capture a Nazi fugitive named Dieter Vogel. Their daring widely celebrated exploits become the subject of a book written in 1997 by Sarah Gold (Romi Aboulafia) the daughter of two of the agents: Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren) and her ex-husband Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson). Rachel particularly has been lionized for the courage she displayed in her younger days. She not only had the nerve to entrap her diabolical quarry a Mengele-like doctor whose gruesome nickname was the Surgeon of Birkenau but she also had the presence of mind to shoot him dead when he tried to escape." and he becomes a prisoner in the apartment. Earlier under a false name he had been Rachel�۪s gynecologist ��� she posed as a patient to pierce his cover ��� and this history produces a queasy intimacy between them that he tries to exploit to gain her sympathy. Rachel and David are so earnest and idealistic that standing guard over this embodiment of evil feeding him and enduring his anti-Semitic taunts seems to put their souls in peril. Three decades later his memory haunts them like a curse." reasonably clever and sometimes piquant entertainment but they also make you aware that it could have been more." through revisionist flashbacks and tense elliptical conversations the accepted account of Rachel�۪s actions begins to erode. The third member of the team David (Ciaran Hinds) shows up and his anguished demeanor and alarming actions are the first signs of serious trouble. So back we go and then forward through the turns of an absorbing sometimes improbable narrative of guilty secrets and unintended consequences." angry swearing and some uncomfortable sexual situations." Stephan by Marton Csokas and Rachel by Jessica Chastain. Ms. Chastain this year�۪s officially designated emerging movie star seems a bit too delicate to take down a war criminal or to grow up into the regal world-weary Helen Mirren but her exquisite sensitivity nonetheless provides ���The Debt�۝ with its emotional center of gravity." ambitious and cynical. A tense triangular workplace romance takes shape as Rachel negotiates her ambivalent attraction to both men and their much less ambivalent attraction to her. The one she falls in love with may not be the one she ends up with." they are both in their different ways captivating: Ms. Chastain for her expressiveness and Ms. Mirren for her stoicism. The men are all simpler more boldly drawn creatures but the actors do their jobs with efficiency and conviction and the dashing Mr. Csokas supplies otherwise missing elements of humor and sex."

Corinne is smart and capable and while her childhood was shadowed by the unhappy marriage of her parents (John Hawkes and Donna Murphy) she is hardly a desperate pilgrim clinging to easy consolation." a remarkably subtle and expressive instrument.

Pastor Bill has made reference to Revelation 3:16 ��� ���because you are lukewarm neither hot nor cold I shall spew you from my mouth�۝ ��� a verse that seems unequivocal in its condemnation of uncertainty.

Especially when Corinne is with her friend Annika (the amazing earthy Dagmara Dominczyk) ��� who speaks in tongues to God and with easy candor about sex ��� she feels loved and listened to. The patriarchal ways of the pastor (Norbert Leo Butz) and his wife (Barbara Tuttle) grate on Corinne in part because they stifle the intellectual curiosity that feeds her faith." given her professional background ��� a breakthrough performance in ���Down to the Bone �۝ and she nearly stole ���Up in the Air�۝ from George Clooney ��� Ms. Farmiga lavishes solicitous attention on her actors virtually none of whom strike a false note. The story has one or two (like a visit from Corinne�۪s feckless sister played by Nina Arianda) and there are a few fantasy sequences that feel jarring and superfluous." when she joins a tightly knit ecstatic band of worshipers that Christianity becomes a significant force in Corinne�۪s life. A bookish freethinking adolescent she falls in love with Ethan (Boyd Holbrook later Joshua Leonard) who plays guitar and has a troubled sensitive face that is almost a mirror of her own. She becomes pregnant they marry young and a near-catastrophe nudges them from the life of feckless young rock �۪n�۪ rollers and literary dreamers onto the path of salvation." thoughtful way across the burned-over terrain of the American culture wars. The film directed with disarming grace and sharp intelligence by Vera Farmiga (who also stars in it) is about the conflict between skepticism and religious faith but it does not treat that battle as an either/or winner-take-all proposition. Movies about belief and believers frequently succumb to woozy piety or brittle contempt but ���Higher Ground�۝ belongs along with Robert Duvall�۪s ���Apostle�۝ and Michael Tolkin�۪s underappreciated ���Rapture �۝ among the elect. Focused with sympathetic intensity on the ordeal of a single soul it illuminates as though from within a complex spiritual struggle."

If Pinkie�۪s recklessly impulsive behavior is that of a frightened teenager Mr. Riley�۪s slick hair facial scar and cold wide-eyed stare suggest a seasoned smoothie who has watched a lot more dirty water slosh under the bridge than any teenager could have witnessed. The obvious comparison is with Leonardo DiCaprio who probably would have given the character more subtext than is supplied by Mr. Riley�۪s vicious sadist who carries a bottle of acid to splash in the faces of enemies." and Mr. Joffe�۪s chilly film doesn�۪t sentimentalize their relationship except for a crucial touch at the end. Like the Boulting adaptation Mr. Joffe�۪s removes the novel�۪s final deadly sting substituting a fateful quasi-religious miracle that protects Rose from emotional ruin. That change is less a sacrilege than some purists might think since Greene himself collaborated on the earlier film�۪s screenplay with Terence Rattigan." they are also slightly over-the-hill small-time bookies who seem anything but invincible and the movie gives each a complicated personality.

Her eccentric eye and offbeat rhythm sustain ���One Day�۝ through its stretches of banality and mitigate some of its flaws. Among these are a superficial sense of history ��� remember how girls used to wear their hair? remember nuclear disarmament? ��� and more seriously a late disastrous dive into the deep end of weepitude." though I�۪m grateful that it briefly revived interest in W. H. Auden�۪s poetry.) ���One Day�۝ traffics in the same breezy inviting Anglo-ness finding charm in London�۪s gray weather and gentle comedy in the residue of the class system.

Some years are skipped over altogether and others are indicated by a few seconds of actions: an unanswered phone call; a dive into a swimming pool. When we do linger with Emma and Dex separately or together some discreet exposition catches us up on what we need to know." as the two of them thrown together after a night out with friends tumble back to Emma�۪s room as dawn approaches. Though they will remember this not-quite tryst as a ���near miss �۝ it cements an affection that waxes and wanes over the years.

To recast the metaphor for the current era it may even be desirable to reshuffle the tracks to suit diverse sensibilities. Did you like ���When Harry Met Sally�۝? (Now is not the time to act all cool and artsy. I know you did. I saw you there.) Well ���One Day�۝ is like a cover version played by a clever British pop band hitting the theme of platonic male-female friendship (and the supposed long-term impossibility thereof) in a different tempo and key." but ���One Day�۝ is at its best ��� observant relaxed touching and charming ��� when the central couple are apart. As they make their way through professional ups and downs and serious relationships with other people the movie opens up and allows its attention to wander into odd corners and byways encountering vivid fully dimensional minor characters along the way. Among these are Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dex�۪s parents and Rafe Spall and Romola Garai as the poor souls who would appear on paper to be perfect matches for Emma and Dex." Jim Sturgess (Dexter) Patricia Clarkson (Alison) Ken Stott (Steven) Romola Garai (Sylvie) and Rafe Spall (Ian)." I�۪ll tread lightly here but what happens near the end of ���One Day�۝ is likely to have a decisive effect on your opinion of the movie. Perhaps you will have seen this climax coming all along and maybe you will find it splendidly moving. On the other hand you might cringe to see the film�۪s wit and delicacy ruined by maudlin excess and wish you could remix the tape to get rid of that song you always hated." when they are newly fledged happily drunken university graduates to a point just short of the present which is to say middle age for them.

This is the Family Mozart Mr. F̩ret seems to declare with this scene stripped down and at their most human." the subject of at least three novels also titled ���Mozart�۪s Sister �۝ is in this film meant to be something more than a chapter in her brother�۪s biography though it�۪s not exactly clear what. Somewhat frustratingly if reasonably Mr. F̩ret never settles on whether she was a genius a martyr a feminist cause a disappointed daughter a resigned woman or all of the above. In a famous portrait of the family painted around 1780 the adult Wolfgang and Nannerl sit side by side at a piano while Leopold stands to the right holding a violin. Wolfgang and Nannerl�۪s hands are crossed over the keyboard an apt image for a duet that by that point was over.

The costumes and sets are attractive without being fussily art-directed and the dialogue flows out of the everyday business of life on the road with the itinerant brood forced to bed down wherever they can. The contrast between the family�۪s personal and public lives can make for lightly charming scenes as when Nannerl and Wolfgang whoop it up during a pillow fight and are ordered to bed by their mother. Their rowdy cries the joyous yelling of two briefly liberated children are a tiny shock in a story lifted by ethereal music and often brought down to earth by monotone filmmaking." Los Angeles and Santa Fe N.M." among other sources Mr. F̩ret paints a speculative intimate portrait of a family bound by love genius and ambition and almost undone by the same. When the film opens Leopold a musician in his mid-40s when the tour started is a pushy if loving stage father so dazzled by his son that he hardly has eyes or ears for Nannerl. His favoritism is clouded by the parochialism of the day as when he scolds her for playing the violin which he deems an unsuitable instrument for a girl. Her role in life has been decided. An accomplished harpsichordist (and pianist) and singer she serves as her brother�۪s accompanist: when he saws on his violin sometimes while blindfolded she sits smiles and plays." Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia Mozart born in 1751 and known as Nannerl was said to posses a rare talent that by some accounts this film included nearly rivaled that of her brother. Played by Marie F̩ret (the filmmaker�۪s daughter) Nannerl is an attractive obedient and rather opaque 14-year-old going on 15 given to watchful silences and long looks at Wolfgang (David Moreau) who was younger by four and a half years. They were the only children out of the seven born to Leopold (Marc Barb̩) and Anna-Maria (Delphine Chuillot) to survive childhood. If the calamity of those deaths weighed on the family it doesn�۪t register in ���Mozart�۪s Sister �۝ which unfolds at the end of a long tour that began in 1763 when Wolfgang was 7." despite moments of self-consciousness about her subordinate station. In one scene she shows Wolfgang her music book in which Leopold has written praise for his son. (This much-studied trove also contains a number of Mozart�۪s childhood compositions.) Even in her own music book Nannerl sighs she plays second fiddle. It�۪s a role that she fleetingly abandons during her friendships with Louise de France (Lisa F̩ret another of Mr. F̩ret�۪s children) a young daughter of Louis XV and then with the king�۪s newly widowed son the Dauphin (Clovis Fouin).

An office drone with no friends Griff (the terrific Australian actor Ryan Kwanten) spends most of his time in his humble apartment waiting for neighborhood trouble with the longing of a lonely heart listening for the phone to ring. Though Griff is flanked by impressive-looking blinking monitors the modesty of his world his air of innocence and black-and-yellow suit suggests that his super-moniker should be the Amazing Bumblebee." ���Griff the Invisible�۝ works as a slice of emotional life for the most part because of its lead performances (and despite a late lecture about how the kooks are all right).

The original Conan was created by Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) a bullied Texan turned bodybuilder and fantasy writer whose Conan stories were published starting in 1932 in the pulp magazine Weird Tales. In the decades following Howard�۪s death (he shot himself after hearing that his ailing mother had slipped into a coma) the Conan universe grew to include books written by Howard imitators comics and two movies starring the bodybuilder turned governator of California Arnold Schwarzenegger.

from the bright open plantation where Skeeter lives to the shotgun shacks that Aibileen and Minny call home. Everything looks good polished to a high industrial gleam. Save for Ms. Davis�۪s however the performances are almost all overly broad sometimes excruciatingly so characterized by loud laughs bugging eyes and pumping limbs. Ms. Chastain and Ms. Spencer make quite the raucous comedy team and while there�۪s pleasure in their routine all that comedy can feel misplaced. They have some genuinely touching moments together when you see two women each struggling with the burdens of race and class. But just when you think it might get too heavy Minny starts vacuuming a stuffed bear for some laughs." minding a pale dumpling named Mae Mobley whose own mother Elizabeth (Ahna O�۪Reilly) called Miss Leefolt by Aibileen scarcely touches the child. Aibileen loves the white babies she helps raise though that affection comes with so many choking complexities that they can leave her near-speechless as the promising first scene shows. Did you always think you would be a maid? an off-screen woman asks. Aibileen answers quietly but with matter-of-fact directness yes: Her mother was a maid and her grandmother had been a house slave. Did you have dreams of being something else? the unseen woman asks her voice so guileless and so maddeningly oblivious that it�۪s a wonder that Ms. Davis who has been looking directly into the camera nearly burning right through it doesn�۪t sneer." often beautifully. She doesn�۪t just turn Aibileen something of a blur in the novel into a fully dimensional character she also helps lift up several weaker performances and invests this cautious at times bizarrely buoyant movie with the gravity it frequently seems to want to shrug off. She keeps your attention focused on her and Minny even when the story drifts over to Elizabeth and her white friends who include a segregationist housewife Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard energetic in a thankless role) and the far more liberal Skeeter (Emma Stone uncharacteristically wan). A would-be writer Skeeter is the one asking Aibileen all those questions." though is the novel�۪s conceit that the white characters with their troubled relationships and unloved children carry burdens equal to those of the black characters. Like the novel the movie is about ironing out differences and letting go of the past and anger. It�۪s also about a vision of a divided America that while consistently insulting and sometimes even terrifying is rarely grotesque despite Hilly�۪s best (worst) segregationist efforts. Inside all these different homes black and white women tend to the urgent matters of everyday life like the care and feeding of children. And while every so often the roar of the outside world steals in like thunder Mr. Taylor makes sure it doesn�۪t rattle the china or your soul." Ms. Stockett a white woman has suggested that she was somewhat inspired by Demetrie McLorn a black woman who worked as a maid for her family who died when Ms. Stockett was 16 and spoke to judge from the book�۪s afterword in dialect. Some readers have objected to Ms. Stockett�۪s decision to use black dialect that in the case of Aibileen is so thick and old-timey (���sho nuff�۝) that it�۪s as if Ms. Stockett were trying to channel Mark Twain. Her white characters by contrast are mostly written in ���correct�۝ English even Celia who in less genteel quarters would be called poor white trash. The dialect doesn�۪t register as weighty in the movie largely because Ms. Davis�۪s performance speaks louder than her accent." Tate Taylor had his way your tear ducts would be sucked dry by that big finish emptied out by a pileup of calamities that include a painful romantic breakup the devastations of cancer and the mighty wailing of an emotionally abandoned toddler. And that�۪s just what�۪s ailing the white folks. The black characters have it tough too no question and Mr. Taylor includes enough scenes of Aibileen and her best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer) cleaning white houses and polishing the silver ��� and cooking meals and tending children and smiling always smiling even as they pretend not to hear the insults ��� to remind you that this is at least partly about backbreaking soul-killing black labor."

Skeeter recently graduated from the University of Mississippi has returned home to find that Constantine (a frail-looking Cicely Tyson) her family�۪s longtime maid and the woman who raised her has disappeared. As Skeeter tries to find out what happened to Constantine ��� Skeeter�۪s ill mother Charlotte (Allison Janney) isn�۪t saying ��� she begins a process of discovery. She lands a newspaper job meets a boy (Chris Lowell) and slowly starts to see her friends for the bigots they are. Alas she doesn�۪t cozy up to the only interesting white woman in town Celia (a winning Jessica Chastain) a bottle blonde shunned by almost everyone but her own maid Minny."

During this interlude Mr. Kiefer ranges far and wide touching on light (he thinks all light is interesting); the cosmos; his childhood; ���the celestial palaces�۝ (perhaps a reference to an image from Jewish mysticism); the 17th-century English thinker Robert Fludd to whom Mr. Kiefer has dedicated various artworks; and another of his touchstones Martin Heidegger whom Mr. Kiefer invokes on the subject of boredom. At one point two boys wander in presumably because they live there." though one that says as much about its British director Sophie Fiennes as about its stated subject the German-born artist Anselm Kiefer.

He and his assistants then began creating installations on the property that at least to judge from this movie are a monument to the human will to self-annihilation and a rehearsal for the apocalypse." the scene shifts from these depopulated detritus-lined spaces to a man working in front of an outdoor kiln. The sounds of music are replaced by bird song and then by the metallic clanging and banging of men at work. From the way the thin man with the glasses bald head and face full of stubble directs the others in French instructing them on their various tasks like a factory boss you quickly figure out which one is Mr. Kiefer. Suddenly what had threatened to turn into an art-history slide show is given vague context as the movie fills up with scenes of men mixing concrete melting lead excavating dirt and working on ��� and in the case of Mr. Kiefer walking on ��� enormous canvases." like so much in ���Over Your Cities Grass Will Grow �۝ are never addressed by Ms. Fiennes perhaps because to do so might force her to employ banal documentary strategies like identifying people. Instead she tosses in some introductory text and sets her camera loose. And because she won�۪t or can�۪t engage the complexities of the art and the arguments that have long surrounded it (involving for instance Mr. Kiefer�۪s appropriation of Nazi imagery) she embraces a silence that nonetheless clamorously draws attention to itself through the cinematography and some of the same music that Stanley Kubrick used in ���2001.�۝ It�۪s unfortunate that in gliding through these ravaged spaces while dodging time and its traumas she embraces the role of tourist rather than of the vigorous questioning participant that Mr. Kiefer�۪s work solicits and demands." Mr. Kiefer and his team burrowed into the earth dug tunnels constructed an amphitheater painted (and threw dust and broken glass on) canvases and kiln-fired lead sculptures that look like books turning the sprawl into a massive atelier he called La Ribaute. Ms. Fiennes whose movies include the nonfiction romp ���The Pervert�۪s Guide to Cinema �۝ featuring the loquacious philosopher and cinephile Slavoj Zizek arrived in La Ribaute shortly before Mr. Kiefer moved to Paris where he now lives and works.

As in ���Vertigo �۝ the past in ���Mysteries of Lisbon�۝ doesn�۪t remain past but spirals into the present overwhelming it to the point that Pedro ��� as his story is repeatedly overtaken ��� becomes a near-footnote in his own life as is true of us all." Mr. Ruiz makes his way fluidly through this unusual bildungsroman which in less able hands could easily have transformed into a confusing narrative thicket. But there�۪s a lightness of touch here despite the sometimes heavier moments that extends from the prowling camera to the way Mr. Ruiz nestles one character�۪s memory inside other memories. In one such sequence and at the urging of a distraught ��ngela Father Dinis shares the story of Jọo�۪s paternity with the boy and the scene shifts to the past when a wounded Don Pedro stumbled into the school. Then as if picking up a baton in a relay race Don Pedro begins to recount his and ��ngela�۪s tragic romance and the scene and time shift once again taking the tale deeper into the past." ���Mysteries of Lisbon�۝ is a mystery involving Jọo but one that opens and keeps opening life after life to embrace the near-entirety of his world. Drawing on narrative traditions from popular melodramas to avant-garde theater Mr. Ruiz best known in America for his 1999 adaptation of Proust�۪s ���Time Regained �۝ turns ���Mysteries of Lisbon�۝ into yet another search for lost time. In the new movie Pedro�۪s voice-over serves as a narrative through line that again and again gives way to other voices that take possession of the story even as it also finally touchingly circles back to the beginning. Along the way Pedro retraces his life summoning up memories that address the ambiguities of his origins." one in which time is the treasure and the past its hiding place. ���The transmutation of sensation into sentiment �۝ he wrote ���the ebb and tide of memory waves of emotions such as desire jealousy and artistic euphoria ��� this is the material of the enormous and yet singularly light and translucid work.�۝" based on the novel by Camilo Castelo Branco; director of photography Andr̩ Szankowski; edited by Val̩ria Sarmiento and Carlos Madaleno; music by Jorge Arriagada and Luis Freitas Branco; art direction by Isabel Branco; produced by Paulo Branco; released by Music Box Films. In Portuguese French and English with English subtitles. Running time: 4 hours 17 minutes. This film is not rated." ���Mysteries of Lisbon�۝ is also an elegiac meditation on love lost and rediscovered through misted memory. Directed by the Chilean filmmaker Ra̼l Ruiz and set mainly in Portugal with detours to other European corners it is a period picture based on a work by the prolific Camilo Castelo Branco (1825-90) who was born in Lisbon illegitimate and orphaned and flirted with the priesthood before finding his calling in writing running off with a married woman landing in prison and finally committing suicide. Mr. Ruiz�۪s ���Mysteries�۝ are just as outlandish gloriously so." dastardly men and overheated emotions that at times run perilously if self-consciously close to soap operatic parody. Mr. Ruiz certainly solicits laughter with moments of weird comedy some of which almost take you out of the movie. But even at his most playfully Brechtian including when he�۪s making you aware of the artifice of the material ��� as in the introductory images of illustrated glazed tiles that directly allude to later scenes ��� Mr. Ruiz keeps you hooked pulled in by the sympathetic and comically off-putting performances and by his delightful supple fully cinematic storytelling." time frames and marvelous details in ���Mysteries of Lisbon �۝ which stretches across at least three generations. Soon after he first appears Jọo discovers that he�۪s the son of a countess ��ngela de Lima (Maria Jọo Bastos) who visits him one night after he�۪s injured. She brings him a theater diorama as a gift a miniature that he carries with him and that emerges as a crucial storytelling device. Mostly though she almost magically grants his wish becoming the mother he longed for and filling in the first blank in a puzzle that eventually will also be solved with the help of Father Dinis; Jọo�۪s father Don Pedro (Jọo Baptista); a scar-faced pirate Alberto (the excellent Ricardo Pereira); and others." the movie now runs an absorbing astonishingly fast four and a quarter hours. It�۪s being presented with a brief charitable intermission which should give you time to (among other things) wrap your head around Mr. Ruiz�۪s elegant twists. The story opens and closes with a voice-over belonging to a man you come to know as Pedro da Silva but initially know as a 14-year-old called ���just Jọo�۝ (played as a teenager by Jọo Luis Arrais and as an adult by Afonso Pimentel). Believing himself an orphan he lives in a boarding school run by the kind bluntly spoken Father Dinis (Adriano Luz) whose cassock and tender manner obscure an adventurous thorny past."

Freida Pinto (Caroline) John Lithgow (Charles Rodman) Brian Cox (John Landon) Tom Felton (Dodge) David Oyelowo (Steven Jacobs) David Hewlett (Hunsiker) Andy Serkis (Caesar) and Terry Notary (Bright Eyes/Rocket)." ���Rise of the Planet of the Apes�۝ settles into a playful stretch. Caesar cozies into his human home for an inverse version of the first ���Apes�۝ movie (with shades of ���Curious George�۝) if mostly without incident despite foreboding static with a neighbor (David Hewlett). Time passes and Caesar grows stronger and smarter as Will finds a love (Freida Pinto) and Charles suffering from Alzheimer�۪s worsens. In desperation Will plays God and turns Charles into his next experiment becoming both the son and the father to his own lab rats. More time passes and a story about a modern blended family shifts into a jittery cautionary tale about man�۪s domination of nature and turns ���Apes�۝ into a weird twin of the recent documentary ���Project Nim �۝ about a chimp who was used and abused in the 1970s in the name of science." as with a lost space team and a toy Statue of Liberty.) Then again the exploitation of animals in the name of human progress is a horror-fiction staple and in the 1960s and �۪70s screens overflowed with marauding rats bunnies sharks and yet more apes as the magical animals of the Walt Disney generation gave way to fanged and furry avengers of the hippie nation. ���Rise of the Planet of the Apes�۝ may be primarily a calculated business decision but it�۪s also a smiley wag (or flick) of the environmental finger." a British filmmaker whose credits include the independent feature ���The Escapist �۝ handles both the intimately scaled scenes and blockbuster-size action capably. Either he or Mr. Franco smartly decided that the actor�۪s performance should be delivered without knowing self-mockery a strategy that helps keep the ridiculous story from collapsing into full-on camp. Even as the movie grows stranger more outlandish and science bleeds into science fiction Mr. Franco maintains a straight face selling his relationships with Charles and Caesar. Mr. Wyatt meanwhile toggles between the large-scale special-effects-assisted action ��� there�۪s a nice moment when leaves fall like rain as the chimps take to the trees canopying a suburban street ��� and the cinema�۪s greatest special effect: the face some digital." ���Rise of the Planet of the Apes�۝ may be awkwardly named but almost everything else about it is generally easygoing including the inevitable climactic action and the human and digitally assisted performances. First among the computer creations is Caesar who evolves from a ball of fluff into a rambunctious child a sullen teenager and finally a young adult given nuance through performance-capture technology (which combines an actor�۪s moves with computer-generated imagery) and the efforts of Andy Serkis the actor who brought Gollum to life in ���The Lord of the Rings�۝ trilogy.

Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes." you could see an analogy between our world in which digital characters are fast catching up to their human counterparts and that of ���Rise of the Planet of the Apes �۝ which clears the stage for a coming ape revolution (and doubtless more movies). But that wouldn�۪t jibe with Mr. Wyatt�۪s genial untroubled take on the apocalypse. Though it skews grim in a Dickensian primate facility where Caesar learns some hard truths under heavy hands ��� and where you could swear the fuzzy inmates chant a protest that sounds remarkably like ���Attica! Attica!�۝ ��� the film is largely perversely upbeat. It�۪s the end of the world as we know it and the animals feel fine." �۝ an amusingly cheerful film about the end of humanity that�۪s PETA and critic approved ��� no animals were harmed in its making and neither was James Franco�۪s career ��� is precisely the kind of summer diversion that the studios have such a hard time making now. It�۪s good canny-dumb fun. Employing bleeding-edge technologies in the service of old-fashioned entertainment it insists on the emotional truth of its absurd story its tongue in cheek (and in check) while offering self-aware asides like the ritual bow to Charlton Heston the lockjaw hero of the original 1968 ���Planet of the Apes.�۝" the new ���Apes�۝ movie takes place in a present that with a few exceptions (a space mission included) looks plausibly like our own. Mr. Franco ��� serious focused sympathetic ��� plays Will Rodman a scientist and romantic idealist who is one hubristic mistake away from becoming a latter-day Frankenstein. Like the shiny headquarters at Gen-Sys the pharmaceutical giant for which he works Will makes science look good as he bustles about in his white lab coat.

The project was founded in 1995 by Dr. Gary Slutkin an epidemiologist who traveled the world including for the World Health Organization Global Program on AIDS. After returning home to Chicago and hearing stories about children murdering children he created the project operating from the reasonable premise that violence is fundamentally a public health issue. To judge from the documentary which follows activists taking their message to Chicago�۪s mean streets over the course of a year (it winds down in spring a not entirely persuasive nod to new beginnings) we are living in plague years." partly because of the contrast between her petite size and outsized personality and because of her ancestry and background is a documentary gift. (Her father Jeff Fort was a former teenage gang member in Chicago who helped organize its gangs into an influential crime organization.) Now married to an imam the mother of four children her hair tucked under a scarf Ms. Matthews talks openly about her past (an old photo of her in fur at a club helps tell that tale) sometimes while driving through the city restively scanning its streets. She left gang life after being shot and now like Mr. Bocanegra and Mr. Williams radiates a born-again fervor: she�۪s saving souls and perhaps redeeming her own." including one that resulted in the death of a high school student." �۝ a hard wallop of a documentary may weigh heavily on your heart and head but they will also probably infuriate you. When a frail-looking child with startled eyes breaks down crying her tiny hands covering her tiny face as she talks about a neighborhood shooting it�۪s hard not to want to gather her up in your arms. It�۪s also difficult not to feel outrage along with a sense of confused familiar helplessness because this child lives in that war-torn part of the world called Chicago." nonfiction movies in which filmmakers train their cameras at people enduring crushing hardships. At their worst these documentaries exploit the suffering of others turning their pain into consumable spectacles. ���The Interrupters�۝ evades that trap partly because it doesn�۪t try to sell a happy easily digestible story and partly because it digs in.

In one respect ���The Interrupters�۝ is about addiction and recovery and a handful of former abusers who having gone down one path have turned their lives around and are making amends. The scenes of the interrupters at work ��� talking to gang members marching in antiviolence protests counseling families being mentors to children speaking at funerals ��� vividly suggest the scope of the human stakes. A fight that erupts outside a CeaseFire office causing Ms. Matthews to charge outside ��� she wedges herself among a cluster of raging circling men and women ��� shows the potential danger of such activist commitment." an initiative of the Chicago Project. The focus of CeaseFire is street violence which organizers try to stem through outreach workers and so-called violence interrupters who literally put themselves in harm�۪s way. The interrupters were featured in a 2008 article in The New York Times Magazine by Alex Kotlowitz who produced the movie with Mr. James. In the article Mr. Kotlowitz quotes Dr. Slutkin�۪s succinct epidemiological position on violence: ���Violent activity predicts the next violent activity like H.I.V. predicts the next H.I.V. and TB predicts the next TB.�۝ The interrupters try to block the transmission of that activity with words and an occasional hand on a shoulder." �۝ Dr. Slutkin once said in an interview for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation which helps support the Chicago Project for Violence Prevention ���some modeling some hand holding some safe retreat and face saving you can change people.�۝ It is he says ���only a behavioral norm.�۝ Mr. James doesn�۪t challenge or present any outside takes on Dr. Slutkin�۪s public-health approach to violence a valid filmmaking choice. Among other things the movie�۪s tight focus means that there�۪s little attention to political and historical contexts: there is nothing about gun control for instance or the legacy of race relations in Chicago. That said a sense of the larger political and policy issues does emerge mostly through the lived experience of those in front of the camera." the movie follows starting in 2009 interrupters in the field as well as in offices homes meeting rooms and cemeteries. It checks in somewhat too briefly with Dr. Slutkin who bluntly likens violence to an infectious disease and makes more time for Tio Hardiman. The director of CeaseFire Illinois Mr. Hardiman a likable man with a bouncer�۪s build functions as a kind of guide to this world describing how the interrupters work on a practical level and introducing the three who quickly become the movie�۪s focus: Eddie Bocanegra Ameena Matthews and Ricardo Williams known as Cobe. Each is a self-described former gang member and so fascinatingly complex that any one of them could spin off into a separate documentary."

In addition to the talking cat there is a talking moon a T-shirt that moves on its own and Jason�۪s sudden discovery of the power to stop time. These phenomena coexist with a more mundane story of betrayal and disappointment: a funny-sad relationship drama about love gone astray.

Boyle doesn�۪t so much break the law as make his own hiring prostitutes for extracurricular sport and ignoring the usual policing niceties.

To become Uday Latif pops in prosthetic teeth hunches his shoulders and turns his voice into a stammering screech and Mr. Cooper in effect parodies one of his roles from inside another." and it is perhaps a little too entertaining for its own good. At times it abandons historical reckoning for pulpy sensationalism. Latif pursues an affair with Uday�۪s regular mistress Sarrab played in a succession of wigs and femme fatale mannerisms by Ludivine Sagnier and then in the movie�۪s unconvincing final act he turns from a prisoner of circumstance into a suave international action hero." a quiet man with a troubled conscience serves as our guide and moral protector during this behind-the-scenes tour of hell.

Mr. Ristovski plays a charismatic stranger who appears in a village ravaged by flood at a warehouse where the townspeople have gathered for shelter. Promising to help them via hypnosis he lulls one woman into a stupor from which he promises she will emerge feeling wonderful and full of hope." these cynical stories of humble people embracing absurd illusions illustrate the universal impulse to believe in a better future no matter what. People as desperate as these are easy marks for snake-oil peddlers mad men and predators of every stripe.

The film�۪s five vignettes whose characters cling to irrational optimism in the face of poverty injustice and hatred are all set in an unidentified Eastern European wasteland of bleak farming villages one of which has been inundated by a flood." about compulsive gambling. In the fourth he is the father of young woman who is raped by his boss the bigwig owner of the local foundry in which all the men in the town work. That episode which illustrates the power of a dictator to act with impunity is the most acutely political of the tales."

The setup is familiar as are the essential elements: a single man and a single woman two battered hearts yet a pair of resilient eager pretty bodies.

The best and most unusual scenes are of her slowly reciting and revising sentences while an assistant takes them down on a manual typewriter and of her arguing fine points of German with a musician friend whom she uses as a kind of ideal reader.

Disney perhaps resting on the perennial merchandising popularity of Pooh Tigger Piglet and the others allowed quality control to slip. Movies like ���The Tigger Movie�۝ (2000) and ���Piglet�۪s Big Movie�۝ (2003) were for the most part limp unimaginative attempts to pander to the preschool market ��� a tradition that continues in ���The Ballad of Nessie �۝ a cloying unconvincingly preachy short (with some nice background animation) that accompanies ���Winnie the Pooh�۝ in theaters.

It has no attention-grabbing celebrity voice work and the only pop-cultural allusions it makes are to other stories and films about Pooh and his friends.

She is a master of epistemological S-and-M or maybe just very good at roleplaying." Ms. McKinney returned to the public eye when she traveled to South Korea to clone her beloved pit bull Booger. She was initially outraged when some journalists connected that episode with her earlier moment of fame going so far as to threaten legal action against anyone who pointed out that she was that Joyce McKinney." and she proved to be an ideal tabloid subject: pretty talkative and (depending on the paper and the week) either a wronged Southern belle or a devious femme fatale.

Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) have become powerful adult wizards while the actors are now stars. Look closely and you can see the beard inching along Harry�۪s or rather Mr. Radcliffe�۪s pale chin. Meanwhile Ms. Watson smoldering in bruising dark lipstick on the cover of the July Vogue has her own hair and makeup artist and the director David Yates even trains the camera on her generous peekaboo cleavage. Just as startling is the transformation of Mr. Grint who in one early anxious scene wears a goatee and a panicked look that together suggest a junior Paul Giamatti. My how the children have grown ��� and the movies too." especially the wizards whose very ordinary habits prejudices quirks and fears made this fantastical world recognizable. Over time the special effects have grown more special but at their finest these are so seamlessly integrated that they no longer pop off the screen (even in 3-D) and instead serve the story�۪s emotional realism. When you see the albino dragon in ���Part 2 �۝ you may marvel at the technical virtuosity of its creation and how the muscles on its flanks clench with palpable effort as it looks down at a cityscape much as King Kong once did. Yet what lingers is how quickly this computer-made creature becomes a character." through the very fine and less so movies it maintained its storytelling and filmmaking integrity despite the corporate imperative. The love of the fans helped keep the series on track as did the filmmakers (technicians included) and performers. The movies have affirmed that the relationship between mass art and its consumers is at times incredibly rich evident in the mind-blowing fan culture of Potter world.

Finally too there is Mr. Rickman who as Snape Harry�۪s longtime nemesis lifts the movie to its expressive high point. First seen standing in a window shaped like a coffin Snape enters gravely a picture of death. Pale and unsmiling his black hair framing his white face like mourning crepe he has always suggested Laurence Olivier�۪s Richard III an ominous thought with children in the vicinity. That Snape has proven worthy of that comparison is partly a tribute to Ms. Rowling but that he has become such a brilliant screen character is due to Mr. Rickman who helped elevate a child�۪s tale of good and evil into a story of human struggle." partly because it�۪s been unexpectedly moving growing older with these characters and actors perhaps simply because it�۪s invariably poignant watching children become adults. However uneven they were at the start the three young leads were irresistible simply because they were so young unformed and vulnerable (like their characters). Ms. Watson was the most assured while Mr. Grint was the natural (and still is). Mr. Radcliffe button cute capable opaque was tougher to warm up to. But it�۪s pointless to think of anyone else. He became Harry Harry is him and Mr. Radcliffe�۪s depthless quality now seems right for a character who in the books and movies was never as interesting as the magical world he revealed to us." if largely bloodless but be warned that several beloved characters do die and that is upsetting." this time forever with tears and howls swirls of smoke the shock of mortality and bittersweet smiles in ���Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 �۝ the grave deeply satisfying final movie in the series.

There�۪s no time for adolescent angst in war. Now when a student (he who shall not be named so as not to ruin the fun) declares his affection for another ��� the air electric with fire frenzy and young love (if never lust) ��� it�۪s because as he says both may soon be dead.

Meanwhile this declaration especially given the casualties to come may fill you with feeling and also make you cry." the evil wizard who could not be named for ages but has been for a while Mr. Fiennes has been part of the mix since the fourth film (���The Goblet of Fire�۝). Over the course of the series as Voldemort gathered in power and corporeality his wrenched Medusa-like face eventually growing a body (though oddly losing its nose) the actor started to fill out the character with sharp indelible gestures a flick of the wrist a twist of the mouth. In ���Part 2�۝ his whispering hiss of a voice slithers into ears like a snake seducing and terrorizing. But watch Mr. Fiennes�۪s hands look as they flutter their white spidery fingers idling with exquisite delicacy as the long nails sharpened into perfect arrows threaten the worst." Tom Riddle. The books fat with detail and detours into the past gave Ms. Rowling loads of room to play. With only two or so hours of story time the movies have been forced to sacrifice swaths of her material and while the scripts have been largely models of adaptation ��� most this one included are by Steve Kloves ��� the emphasis on action (and interminable games of quidditch) was also a concession to the action-imperative of the modern blockbuster. (A deadly dull game that served as a rehearsal for war quidditch is one Hogwarts tradition I was happy to see burn.)" particularly during the enervating summer season when it can seem as if Hollywood has forgotten how to put on a really big ��� and great ��� show. (Perhaps the studios should just hand over more blockbusters to the British: Christopher Nolan after all is London born.) It isn�۪t often in the summer that you enjoy the intense pleasure of a certain kind of old-fashioned cinema experience the sort that sweeps you up in sheer spectacle with bigger-than-life images and yet holds you close with intimately observed characters and the details that keep your eyes and mind busy. Too often it can be hard to see the human touch amid the industrial machinery which hasn�۪t been true here." even as Ms. Watson and Mr. Grint whose characters are drifting toward their fate have less to do. All three have nice moments in this movie but it�۪s the older adults who take center stage. Much has rightly been made over the years about how the franchise became a platform for some of the best British actors working a truism that brought it force and gravity as one after another great ��� Michael Gambon Gary Oldman Emma Thompson Jim Broadbent Maggie Smith David Thewlis Jason Isaacs ��� stepped up often wonderfully. Here it�۪s Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman who give the master class in acting." who brought the series into its mature stage with the fifth feature ���The Order of the Phoenix �۝ gets it mostly right in ���Part 2.�۝ The movie the eighth is tightly focused and as somber and unsettling as it should be considering its apocalyptic events. It�۪s also often beautiful washed in gray and so drained of other color that at first it looks as if it�۪s in black and white. It�۪s no wonder: Mr. Yates has kicked into Manichaean mode ��� and it�۪s the fight of good against evil wizards against Voldemort and his hordes ��� so the director can be forgiven for almost overplaying the fascist overtones (the students rhythmically marching in the opener are nearly goose-stepping) if not for the juvenile St. Crispin�۪s Day speech at the end."

The pleasures of Ms. Breillat�۪s work are its commitment and seriousness and its raw sometimes very funny perversity: she�۪s lets everything hang out without apologies." as well as the fantasies and fallacies of heterosexual romantic love it�۪s fitting that Ms. Breillat should be revisiting fairy tales. By reaching back to Perrault it�۪s as if she were examining the Rosetta stone using fairy tales to decrypt the language of happily ever after." pale royals who could have been painted by Vel��zquez if he had used candy colors. And while there are no princes to speak of there are two pretty boys Peter (Kerian Mayan) and Johan (David Chausse) one of whom kisses Anastasia and tells her plenty." though it�۪s truly Ms. Breillat�۪s and thus filled with amusements digressions and discussions about life and femininity. ���I hated girls �۝ Anastasia says at one point casting her scorn on some wee ballerinas. Happily there are dancing and singing bandits to amuse her (and us) a few flashes of the knife and a snow queen who wavers in a darkened window as if through a dark pond." the Brothers Grimm and many others including of course Walt Disney who gave her a blond mane and not a single memorable song. Ms. Breillat�۪s version begins similarly to Perrault�۪s with the birth of a princess. A wizened cackling fairy greets the child by cursing her declaring that she will die on her 16th birthday after being pricked by a spindle. Fortunately three good fairies flutter in and with a few waves of their sparkling wands change fate: instead of dying the princess will sleep. Then Ms. Breillat waves her own magic wand and takes the princess somewhere completely unexpected." settings and artful boils are more convincing than those in ���Bluebeard �۝ which had a cheap look that didn�۪t seem intentional and was even distracting. ���The Sleeping Beauty�۝ is more thoughtfully imagined and art-directed though it�۪s too bad it wasn�۪t shot in film. Its digital images can look thin and don�۪t have the density and near-tactile quality that Ms. Breillat seems at times to seek as her use of richly textured sensuous material like fur and velvet suggests. Despite that her ability to distill ideas into a single punctuating image ��� a woman�۪s torn stocking is here a ragged remnant of a sexual battle ��� remains powerfully in effect." �۝ almost as if she wanted to get her hands on the girl (who can be seen as a stand-in for all girls) before the fairy tale has its way with her. In her version of ���Bluebeard�۝ Ms. Breillat switches back and forth between two young sisters shivering along to the gruesome tale (one is reading it and the other is listening sometimes reluctantly) and two young women playing parts in a period version of the story. Here the figure of the girl is more active (or so it initially seems). Instead of reading the fairy tale she plays the central role: On her 6th (rather than 16th) birthday Anastasia pricks her hand and then surprisingly she sets off." �۝ Catherine Breillat�۪s wily and witty retelling of the fairy tale the enchanted princess doesn�۪t just fall into a 100-year slumber she also hits the road walking and riding into adventure. Simone de Beauvoir wrote in ���The Second Sex �۝ ���Woman is Sleeping Beauty Donkey Skin Cinderella Snow White the one who receives and endures.�۝ After taking up Bluebeard in her previous movie Ms. Breillat has turned to a more familiar tale transforming a story of the universal woman into that of a specific girl Anastasia (played first by Carla Besnainou and then by Julia Artamonov) and the world she makes from her imaginative longing." 323 Avenue of the Americas at Third Street Greenwich Village.

He was eventually accepted by her family." directed by Joseph Dorman explores the history and dissolution of Eastern European Jewish culture and the conflicting desires of later generations to remember and to forget. In the late 19th century Jews were second-class subjects in czarist Russia and convenient scapegoats in times of social and political unrest; any dreams they had of assimilation were shattered by periodic pogroms." where they found it easier to assimilate Sholem Aleichem was not everyone�۪s idea of a forward-looking cultural hero." �۝ as the creator of Tevye the Dairyman Menachem-Mendl and other beloved folkloric characters has been called.

His literary pseudonym was derived from the Hebrew expression ���shalom aleichem �۝ meaning ���peace be with you.�۝" Sholem Aleichem became rich from speculating on stocks but he lost everything in 1890 and fled Russia only to be rescued financially by his mother-in-law although she never spoke to him again.

Dr. Terrace speaking with precision and detachment in present-day interviews is either resigned to being the film�۪s designated villain or oblivious to being set up for that role. His former colleagues some of them also former lovers don�۪t have much good to say and the �۪70s footage showing an academic dandy with a comb-over a BMW and a Burt Reynolds mustache is hardly flattering." Nim bounces like a long-armed David Copperfield from one unnatural home to another ��� a Manhattan brownstone an estate in the Bronx a medical testing center upstate ��� living through periods of pastoral bliss and gothic horror. His tale is Dickensian but also Kafkaesque since he is at the mercy of powerful forces beyond his ken or control." Dr. Terrace was the master of his fate though not always a significant presence in the chimp�۪s day-to-day routine. After leaving Oklahoma Nim was installed in the home of Stephanie LaFarge where he became part of a household that included seven children at least one dog and Ms. LaFarge�۪s husband a poet and ���rich hippie�۝ who appears to have been Nim�۪s romantic rival." Nim was transferred to an estate in Riverdale cared for and tutored by young people ��� most of them women ��� who come before Mr. Marsh�۪s camera in middle age to recall the pleasures and dangers of working with their spirited simian charge. It is hard not to be charmed by the affection that passes between these humans and the chimp or to appreciate what seems to be a reciprocated effort at communication. But at the same time it is difficult to avoid a certain queasiness at the sight of a wild creature forcibly and irrevocably alienated from his nature ��� dressed in clothes tethered and caged smoking a joint out in the woods with his pals.

Unlike the Kafka character however this educated primate never acquired enough words to tell us his story and so ���Project Nim�۝ relies on human interlocutors some of whom cared about Nim a great deal almost all of whom wind up telling us more about themselves." �۝ a new documentary by James Marsh is a probing unsettling study of primate behavior focusing on the complex dynamics of power sex and group bonding in a species whose startling capacity for selfishness and aggression is offset by occasional displays of intelligence and compassion." like everything else in this creature�۪s remarkable heartbreaking life ��� is Nim Chimpsky. In the 1970s he enjoyed (or endured) a season of fame as a research subject. Shortly after his birth at an Oklahoma laboratory Nim was taken from his mother�۪s side and delivered to New York where he became part of an experiment led by a Columbia professor Herbert Terrace to determine whether an ape could be taught human language."

Mr. Marsh by allowing those closest to Nim plenty of room to explain themselves examines the moral complexity of this story without didacticism. He allows the viewer alternately appalled touched and fascinated to be snagged on some of its ethical thorns. He also engages in a bit of manipulation using sleight-of-hand re-enactments and Dickon Hinchliffe�۪s nerve-rackingly melodramatic score to sensationalize a drama that hardly requires it." drug use sexual references and depictions of animal suffering." but Mr. Marsh is less interested in comparatively dry matters of linguistics or neurobiology than in a humid messy domain of identity and emotion that has in the past been the terrain of psychoanalysis. And of literature: Nim thrown from one home to another vulnerable to cruelty and neglect and dependent on the kindness of strangers resembles the titular hero of a Dickens novel an orphan buffeted by circumstances whose biography is also a fable of individual virtue and social injustice." whose last documentary was the lovely Oscar-winning ���Man on Wire �۝ is a patient listener and an able storyteller but the subject of ���Project Nim�۝ is so rich and strange that it might have benefited from the hand of a wilder bolder filmmaker. An obsessive like Errol Morris or Werner Herzog might have pushed beyond pathos and curiosity deeper into the literal no man�۪s land that lies between us and our estranged animal relations. But it is also possible that our language and our science do not equip us to understand the truth about Nim ��� or the truth about us that he may have discovered through years of rigorous involuntary research." a jab at the influential linguist Noam Chomsky whose theories about the innateness and uniqueness of language to humans were the implicit target of Dr. Terrace�۪s work. His project was an effort to discern if a chimpanzee could learn sign language and if that learning could proceed beyond the mimicry of specific gestures into the creation of grammatical sentences. If Nim could be raised more or less as a human child and could master human communication that would challenge the Chomskyan idea of language as a special hard-wired trait fundamentally separating us from other animals. (Koko the gorilla another celebrated signing ape born around the same time as Nim also tested this hypothesis.)"

For much of the film Mr. Belvaux moves seamlessly between two separate realms with Graff and his kidnappers occupying one stage and his family the police politicians and increasingly jittery board members playing their roles in the other. Mr. Belvaux doesn�۪t force the parallels; rather he shows the stress panic and fear that color the interactions on both sides as when he lingers over a late-night conversation between Fran̤oise and a sympathetic cop or makes time for a sociable kidnapper (G̩rard Meylan) who calls himself Le Marseillais and gives Graff a homemade meal." Anne Consigny (Fran̤oise Graff) Andr̩ Marcon (Andr̩ Peyrac) Fran̤oise Fabian (Marjorie) Alex Descas (Walser) G̩rard Meylan (Le Marseillais) and Michel Voita (Commissioner Paoli)." �۝ a solid yet fleet French thriller about a society kidnapping and its shockwaves. You see one world in the gangbuster opening that with a racing camera follows a sleek unidentified man as he hurtles through a day in a matter of moments rushing out of his home whooshing into an office bolting from a meeting and all but flinging himself into the arms of one woman before embracing another. This frenetic activity soon jolts to a halt though when his chauffeured car is jacked and he�۪s snatched by armed kidnappers who turn him into a victim even as the outside world transforms him into the accused." along with the clash of truths and interests is at the core of ���Rapt �۝ which stars Yvan Attal as Stanislas Graff the chairman of a corporation whose cosseted existence comes with a substantial family fortune and what turns out to be a heavy price. As suggested by the film�۪s slamming start and by the luxury that surrounds and at times almost seems to encrust him like barnacles ��� gold trims his mansion and marble turns his office into a mausoleum ��� Graff is an archetypal vision of the industrialist as modern aristocrat. He�۪s the sort of man who makes the society pages when he squires his wife around (Anne Consigny plays the designated weeper Fran̤oise) and the gossip columns when he doesn�۪t." the writer and director Lucas Belvaux sidesteps the post-1968 political context that inevitably frames ���Patty Hearst �۝ Paul Schrader�۪s fictional look at the 1974 kidnapping of Patricia Hearst that briefly turned that heiress into a gun-toting bank-robbing revolutionary known as Tania. But politics are unavoidable of course particularly given the money and power at stake in ���Rapt�۝ and all its grandstanding politicians snooping investigators and howling newshounds. No one gets off easy. But the undifferentiated news media almost come off as bad as the kidnappers (a few of whom are at least individuated) especially as the kidnapping drags on and stories detailing Graff�۪s adult tastes habits weaknesses and pleasures leak into the news that his stunned family absorbs with mounting shame."

This film is not rated." ���Rapt�۝ brings to mind classic films noirs like ���Laura�۝ and ���The Killers�۝ in which somehow physically absent characters come into focus through investigations. Graff may be onscreen for much of the movie but because he�۪s often gagged blindfolded and bound he also presents a question mark a cipher. He�۪s scared and then he�۪s grizzled with a haunted gaunt face full of beard. Mr. Attal makes the most of a difficult role. He seizes your attention with a charismatic gestural performance that slices through rooms and telegraphs what it means to be a master of the universe and then later he gives you pause with the hollowed-out gaze of a man now frighteningly terminally alone." another news cycle kicks in as reporters gather outside his mansion baying for news before turning to something anything else when the information grows stale. In its outlines ��� a man of power humbled ��� the case (and Graff�۪s hauteur) evokes that of Dominique Strauss-Kahn the former chairman of the International Monetary Fund accused of sexually assaulting a New York hotel worker. In truth the story is drawn from the 1978 kidnapping of Baron ��douard-Jean Empain a Belgian-French industrialist who during his ordeal unwillingly lost part of a finger. (As in the movie the purloined flesh was left in a baggage locker for pickup.) Initially identified as radical leftists (snatching the rich was all the vogue in some revolutionary circles) his kidnappers just wanted dough."

In ���Aurora �۝ Mr. Puiu thwarts various narrative (and rhythmic) expectations reversing or avoiding many familiar rules including psychological explanation for what happens.

Viorel the character played by the film�۪s director Cristi Puiu doesn�۪t explain or for that matter bother to do much talking. Mr. Puiu also directed the 2005 festival favorite ���The Death of Mr. Lazarescu �۝ by turns a deadly serious comedy and comically deadpan drama about a broken-down man in a broken-down society dying alone among a veritable crowd of people.

A short while afterward Viorel (a metallurgical engineer) visits a factory where he lurks about ducks out of the view of one worker and retrieves money from another.

For the next hour or so the camera closely tracks the man Viorel and brings to mind the nominally objective style of those fly-on-the-wall documentaries in which the camera hovers near subjects without conspicuous commentary seemingly following rather than predicating (or predicting) the action: Viorel idles in one apartment and then another smokes drives a car smokes some more buys groceries and steadily imperceptibly unnerves you. As in such documentaries Mr. Puiu�۪s fingerprints are all over ���Aurora �۝ evident in both style and sensibility." when it�۪s not. Clocking in at an engrossing immersive three hours the movie is a mystery about the human soul. It�۪s brutal in its particulars with dreary streets bleak houses stray and (maddeningly) barking dogs and the grim hard faces of men and women wearing masks bequeathed to them by Ceausescu. Yet the film is also marked with oddly funny touching exchanges that waver between the ridiculous and the tragic (a mother chastising her child so harshly that she becomes absurd) and that are more generous about people than Mr. Puiu�۪s tough talk may suggest. His stare may seem at times pitiless but there�۪s compassion in his insistence on looking."

It�۪s a trip that eats up thousands of miles takes some two dozen years and is fraught with dangers though sometimes in the movie that threat may be more imaginary than actual as when a basking shark the second largest fish in the world cruises by with its weird wide mouth open yawning in water and prey. Armed with little teeth the basking shark feeds on krill and plankton but its size and cavernous mouth do make for dramatic viewing." Los Angeles San Diego San Antonio and Orlando." but is nonetheless troubling. Documentaries always filter and stage reality and editorial decisions are made with each camera angle and cut. But increasingly convincing digital technologies can make it impossible to know where nonfiction ends and fiction begins. By laying claim to the documentary mantle ���Turtle�۝ also lays claim to the truth. Mr. Stringer has said that it would be impossible to follow a single turtle for decades. But the idea that the audience needs one heroic turtle to follow rather than animals in the wild suggests that nature interests us only if it�۪s as packaged as a Disney animation." a plucky seafarer with high mileage. Since it played at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival where it was in the documentary lineup the movie has picked up plenty of goodwill and awards. Last year its director of photography Rory McGuinness won a wildlife/nature award from the Australian Cinematographers Society. Given the quality of their work the special-effects wizards who whipped up some visual wow for the movie including computer-generated imagery deserve a share of the applause too." and neither are the attendant ethical questions. The field of nature films for instance has a long history of massaging and even brutalizing the truth. In his recent book ���Shooting in the Wild: An Insider�۪s Account of Making Movies in the Animal Kingdom �۝ Chris Palmer recounts a notorious incident in which filmmakers working on a 1950s Disney True-Life Adventures film forced lemmings off a cliff and even tossed some into the sea. The beat goes on: In a 2009 study on documentary ethics by the Center for Social Media one wildlife filmmaker admitted to having a rabbit�۪s leg broken for a scene of one animal hunting another." �۝ including in the melodramatic voice-over by Miranda Richardson so much that you may find yourself volubly rooting for the animal or ���she�۝ as Ms. Richardson calls the movie�۪s ostensible single turtle. Never mind that the wee hatchling that races on the beach and then swims through the roiling churning or sometimes spookily dead waters as an older animal may not be the same one that swims by a fast-moving vortex of silvery fish or makes sweet turtle love. Indeed some of what you see is not real but persuasive computer-generated images ��� in other words special effects."

But embellishing reality in nature films digitally or otherwise for whatever reason (like turning wild animals into characters) does their subjects and audiences a disservice. Parts of ���Turtle: The Incredible Journey�۝ were created on a computer as its credits suggest. But without a disclaimer that explains what�۪s real and not how can viewers including those who may already be skeptical about claims of environmental crises trust that the whole thing hasn�۪t been made up? The loggerhead turtle is a threatened species and one day all we may have left are its computer-generated analogues. Its fight for existence is plenty dramatic already and is a story worth telling honestly." mckeewildthings.com Greg McKee of Wild Things writes that the visual special-effects ���footage of 3-D ���wild animals�۪�ʉ۝ he helped produce for ���Turtle�۝ was so realistic even ���expert zoologists�۝ didn�۪t know what they were watching. He adds ���Besides final modeling and texturing and animation of three photorealistic 3-D hero turtle characters indistinguishable in every way from real turtles I modeled textured and animated blue sharks and composited and supervised almost 100 photorealistic documentary realism shots.�۝" �۝ as a poster for the movie puts it perhaps such digital manipulations are no big deal. Yet since it played at Toronto the movie has often been described as a documentary. Is it? Given the degree of artifice the movie can sometimes seem closer to a docudrama or what in post-World War II Britain were called story documentaries films that blended fiction and nonfiction ��� including actors and studio-set shoots ��� to appeal to a wider audience.

There is a rich past informing every note and melody a tangle of influences that brings echoes of Spain North Africa and other parts of the Mediterranean basin including Istanbul the subject of Fatih Akin�۪s magnificent 2006 music documentary ���Crossing the Bridge.�۝ And there is also an ethic of exploration and invention that is open to infusions of jazz pop and hip-hop." period genre and style but the actual experience of listening to music can often leave such categories in shambles. If I said for example that ���Passione �۝ John Turturro�۪s galvanic tribute to the songs and singers of Naples Italy was a documentary about soul music that might be confusing since that term commonly refers to 1960s African-American music." mixes heartbreak with ecstasy acknowledges the hard realities of poverty and injustice and soars above them. I suspect that if artists like Marvin Gaye Otis Redding or Aretha Franklin were to see this film they would recognize their own art within it." chaotic difficult place memorably portrayed in Matteo Garrone�۪s ���Gomorrah�۝ as an inferno of corruption and violence. This aspect of the city hovers around the edges of ���Passione �۝ which depicts a teeming battered sometimes filthy metropolis that is nonetheless picturesque and endlessly vibrant." and by the biography of James Senese whose father was an African-American soldier and who testifies both to the tolerance and the cruelty of his hometown. It is a place Mr. Turturro clearly loves and whose seductions he manages to capture with intelligence and enthusiasm." and he respects the professionalism of his fellow performers. Music is expressive emotional and lively yes but because it is art it is also work. And while ���Passione�۝ praises the spirit of its subjects it also attends to the discipline and tenacity that makes them worth noticing."

Born in 1974 the son of a New York policeman he attended business school and briefly worked for a large public relations company. Galvanized by a documentary film about environmental destruction he moved to Eugene Ore. where he threw himself into environmental causes. One of his earliest radical acts was to be a lookout while front members burned down a timber plant." the word ���terrorist�۝ implying a murderous agenda by a group devoted (in its own words) to ���economic sabotage and guerrilla warfare to stop the exploitation and destruction of the environment�۝ through nonviolent means. But is burning down a company and threatening the livelihood of its workers truly nonviolent?" although its emotional heat rarely rises to a boil. The most heartbreaking scenes show 500-year-old redwoods being felled and harvested and aerial views of clear-cut forest that resemble scraggly bald patches on a half-shaved head.

���Buck�۝ was directed by Cindy Meehl a fashion designer turned artist who after meeting Mr. Brannaman in 2003 at one of his clinics decided to make a movie about him her first. Finding a great subject can be half the battle in documentary and in Mr. Brannaman she discovered one who holds your attention and heart for a tight 88 minutes. From the moment he gets on his horse (���Well I�۪m off to the office�۝) and through the hushed interludes and excursions down highways and into the past he keeps you rapt. Nonhorse people may find themselves as wowed by Mr. Brannaman�۪s techniques as the lifelong horsewoman I know who mid-viewing blurted out ���No way!�۝" there is something exceptional about how he transcended it. After knocking around in his early 20s he had his mind blown while watching a clinic with Ray Hunt and his teacher Tom Dorrance modern pioneers in a gentle training method ��� a philosophy really ��� that�۪s called perhaps paradoxically (as PETA might insist) natural horsemanship. Smitten by what he saw Mr. Brannaman embraced these methods became a disciple of the men and of Mr. Dorrance�۪s brother Bill and went on to spread the word. It�۪s a measure of the passion this approach inspires that in the book ���The Greatest Horse Stories Ever Told �۝ one observer rhapsodizes: ���Tom Dorrance is Yoda Ray Hunt is Obi-Wan Kenobi and Buck Brannaman is Luke Skywalker!�۝" so Zen-like is Mr. Brannaman�۪s approach. He doesn�۪t whisper (as far as I could hear) though he does speak in a soft pleasant drawl reflecting a childhood spent mainly in Idaho and Montana. Born in 1962 and named Dan he became Buckshot under the hard hand of his father Ace. He began learning rope tricks around 3 and performing with his brother Bill who was called Smokie. The boys traveled around the country performing ��� sometimes blindfolded ��� in rodeos and fairs and on television including a Sugar Pops commercial. If they didn�۪t practice they were whipped by their father though he didn�۪t need a reason."

Running time: 1 hour 28 minutes." fizzy talk and while Ms. Meehl is transparently taken with Mr. Brannaman she does try to put him on terra firma. Working with the cinematographers Guy Mossman and Luke Geissb�_hler and shooting in digital that I often wished were film (the big-sky landscapes deserve a more nuanced texture) she tags after Mr. Brannaman well kind of as his trained horses do. That isn�۪t a bad thing. He and all the pretty horses make for mesmerizing viewing especially when he�۪s quieting colts (he calls them babies) and their often more jittery handlers. ���A lot of times �۝ he says in the voice-over that opens the movie ���rather than helping people with horse problems I�۪m helping horses with people problems.�۝" people ��� and horses ��� listen. The aw-shucks star and one of the two-legged attractions in the documentary ���Buck �۝ Mr. Brannaman is a former trick rope performer who after a childhood of pain became something of a shaman and an inspiration for the novel and movie ���The Horse Whisperer.�۝ He doesn�۪t just talk to the animals; he also transforms snorting bucking horses into companions who follow his lead without a tether and even join him in a graceful meadow duet." as a violent interlude with a weepy woman and her seemingly crazed stallion proves. This part of the movie works like a punch to the gut but given how close it edges into hagiography it�۪s also necessary as a reminder of what�۪s really at stake. ���Buck�۝ is an imperfect documentary. It leaves nagging questions unanswered including the fate of Mr. Brannaman�۪s brother and the movie�۪s beauty shots at times threaten to embalm nature instead of exalting it. Yet in some sense it was beauty that saved Mr. Brannaman that of his conscience and that of horses which having been tied to humans long ago became companions workers and for some as this lovely movie shows saviors." by extension the documentary is on the surface that of a man who turned hurt into grace operating from a reservoir of patience and profound love of horses. It�۪s also as his quiet stories and those of friends who also pay witness to his cruel history make vividly at times mistily clear a look at the lines connecting parent to child man to beast. Mr. Brannaman�۪s childhood was a horror and while the movie includes chilling reminiscences the most revealing moment comes in an old film clip that Ms. Meehl smartly tucks in and that shows the older Mr. Brannaman leading his small blindfolded boys toward the front of a stage his grip digging so hard into Buck�۪s shoulder that you may wince."

In any case the film directed with bounce and snap by Mark Waters stands as a comeback of sorts for Jim Carrey who mugs and prances and does funny voices and manages not to be upstaged by a half-dozen flightless birds. The birds ��� real gentoo penguins with computer-enhanced abilities ��� honk defecate and waddle around Manhattan while Mr. Carrey�۪s Popper at first vexed and then beguiled by the creatures tries to deal with them his job his children and the state of his soul." with a sigh that his rubbery limbs have lost a bit of stretch and his highly mobile face has acquired some lines. ���Mr. Popper�۪s Penguins �۝ based on the venerable and charming children�۪s book by Richard and Florence Atwater signifies an important stage in Mr. Carrey�۪s maturation or at least his transition from nitwit man-child to goofy dad. Just about every male screen comedian must negotiate this passage at some point: Eddie Murphy managed pretty well for a while with the ���Dr. Dolittle�۝ movies. Adam Sandler struggled with ���Grown Ups �۝ though that film�۪s box office returns suggested that the moviegoing masses did not mind." Popper grows into a sharkish real-estate wheeler-dealer flipping New York landmarks and falling out of touch with his young son (Maxwell Perry Cotton) and adolescent daughter (Madeline Carroll). He must in addition to wrangling the birds ��� a bequest from Dad multiplied by a customer service error ��� try to win back his ex-wife (Carla Gugino) and woo a reluctant seller (Angela Lansbury) to part with the Tavern on the Green." well Jim Carrey. Mr. Carrey is the kind of performer whose shtick reliably trumps psychological sense and the film�۪s blithe incoherence with respect to its main character is one of its virtues. It turns sentimental now and then but it knows ��� Mr. Carrey knows ��� that what the audience wants from him is silliness. Among Popper�۪s possessions is a boxed set of Charlie Chaplin DVDs and while it may be presumptuous of Mr. Carrey to clown in such company he is also paying tribute to a great precursor. The penguins in any case love the Little Tramp recognizing a kindred spirit or at least a similar way of walking." John Morris and Jared Stern based on the novel by Richard and Florence Atwater; director of photography Florian Ballhaus; edited by Bruce Green; music by  Rolfe Kent; production design by Stuart Wurtzel; produced by John  Davis; released by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes." and you can enjoy watching the title characters human and avian cavorting in Popper�۪s snow-filled Manhattan duplex. A neighbor (David Krumholtz) objects and a further complication arise in the form of an officious zoo guy (Clark Gregg) who denies that penguins could love Mr. Popper. But why shouldn�۪t they? And why shouldn�۪t we chuckle at the alliterative shenanigans of his assistant Pippi (Ophelia Lovibond) who packs a peck of plosives into every utterance." �۝ a mildly amusing specimen of a genre that has produced some of the most unspeakable atrocities of recent cinema. (Do you think I�۪m exaggerating? Did you see ���Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel�۝?) The hectic plot is fairly standard with a soft therapeutic coating wrapped around situations that might be unbearably painful or embarrassing in real life."

���The Trip �۝ no hallucinogens are harmed in the Michael Winterbottom comedy of the same title a British road movie laced with lacerating laughs and starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. Mr. Coogan does in fact smoke a joint lighting up in the same house where Coleridge wrote ���Dejection: An Ode�۝ and indulged in opium the soporific that enslaved him in ���humiliation and debasement.�۝ Mr. Coogan has made a career partly by riffing on narcissism and he�۪s in fine self-loving form as is Mr. Brydon. For one man the humiliation of choice here is fame (with a debasement chaser) while for the other it�۪s his incessant vocal mugging. Both give you a contact high." the trip becomes an occasion for philosophizing a journey inward and out as the men joust and parry improvising and entertaining each other at times by imitating hilariously someone else (Michael Caine Sean Connery). They also eat of course often and well dining in restaurants where the rooms and service are hushed and the dishes extravagantly conceptualized and prepared. (With The Observer paying money isn�۪t an issue.) There are gardens of vegetables oceans of seafood a veritable abattoir of meat. At the Cumbrian restaurant L�۪Enclume (one Michelin star) the near-parodic haute and low offerings include lollipops ���made out of duck fat with peanuts�۝ (���Why not?�۝ Mr. Coogan muses) and some foamy pea-green ick made from mallow ginger beer and whiskey and served in a martini glass." the vocal caricatures and Lake District landscapes Mr. Coogan and Mr. Brydon goad each other with prickly jokes and smiled insults all while comparing their successes reciting poetry and walking the moors as well as an occasional tightrope. Sometimes the camaraderie edges into aggression that is soon snuffed out with laughter. Mr. Coogan�۪s stated desire to act for film-art ���auteurs �۝ is one well-chewed bone they tug at as is Mr. Brydon�۪s populist appeal. Since they worked with Mr. Winterbottom in his 2002 film ���24 Hour Party People �۝ Mr. Brydon has continued to blow up bigger in Britain while Mr. Coogan�۪s Hollywood future has dimmed (his star turn in ���Around the World in 80 Days�۝ went nowhere) developments that give ���The Trip�۝ a sting of truth."

Looking into a mirror Mr. Coogan says with strangled effort ��� addressing his twin self the one perhaps responsible for great Coogan creations like Alan Partridge ��� ���I don�۪t care about silly voices.�۝ It�۪s a perfect encapsulation of the contradictions and sad-funny neediness that ���The Trip�۝ gets at so well and a moment that Mr. Winterbottom almost blows with the tinkling piano that creeps onto the soundtrack whenever things turn self-consciously serious.

It�۪s unclear which is which who is who and that�۪s part of the journey ��� the destination too. To the extent that the man at the wheel (Mr. Coogan) and the guy riding shotgun (Mr. Brydon) are playacting is a question that Mr. Winterbottom and his stars enjoyably bat around.

Recently showered with temporal glory at the Cannes Film Festival where it won the Palme d�۪Or this movie Mr. Malick�۪s fifth feature in 38 years folds eons of cosmic and terrestrial history into less than two and a half hours. Its most provocative sequences envision the origin of the universe the development of life on earth (including a few soulful dinosaurs) and then more concisely and less literally the end of time when the dead of all the ages shall rise and walk around on a heavenly beach." but they also have an almost archetypal cultural resonance.

And any criticism will therefore have to be provisional. Mr. Malick might have been well advised to leave out the dinosaurs and the trip to the afterlife and given us a delicate chronicle of a young man�۪s struggle with his father and himself set against a backdrop of rapid social change. And perhaps Melville should have suppressed his philosophizing impulses and written a lively tale of a whaling voyage." death the end of the world." rooted in an idiosyncratic Christianity and also in the Romantic literary tradition the loss of innocence is not a singular event in history but rather an axiom of human experience repeated in every generation and in the consciousness of every individual. The miraculous paradox is that this universal pattern repeats itself in circumstances that are always unique. And so this specific postwar coming-of-age story quietly astute in its assessment of the psychological dynamics of a nuclear family in the American South at the dawn of the space age is also an ode to childhood perception and an account of the precipitous fall into knowledge that foretells childhood�۪s end. It is like Wordsworth�۪s ���Intimations of Immortality�۝ transported into the world of ���Leave It to Beaver �۝ an inadequate and perhaps absurd formulation but one that I hope conveys the full measure of my astonishment and admiration." microbiology and spiritual allegory is a story whose familiarity is at least as important to the design of ���The Tree of Life�۝ as the speculative flights that surround it.

In 1970 a number of its members bungled a hijacking and ended up in North Korea an event included in the movie�۪s documentary-heavy first part. After this period factions were established including the United Red Army and its Middle East-based counterpart the Japanese Red Army (Carlos�۪s buddies).

The later somewhat more controlled sections suggest otherwise specifically the long grinding middle segment and the shorter final siege with their more realistic and emotionally nuanced acting. The stilted and awkward physical and vocal performances in combination with the visually flat cinematography bring to mind the look sound and visual texture of American daytime soaps an association that perversely makes the movie more and more watchable."

I say ���apparently�۝ because an unexplained bit of revisionism at the end of the movie reveals that Shen�۪s panda slaughter was not as extensive as previously believed." goofy eagerness no longer seems quite as amusing now that he is a psychologically damaged warrior. And his action-team entourage drawn from various species of animal and movie star ��� praying mantis tiger monkey etc; Seth Rogen Angelina Jolie Jackie Chan etc. ��� do more to crowd the picture than to enliven it.

Raised by a doting dithering noodle-shop-owning goose Po experiences flashbacks to a traumatic infancy including hazy recollections of his parents that look sketched by hand in contrast to the computer-polished 3-D images that dominate the movie." the mountains and bamboo forests to say nothing of the beasts who populate this confectionary realm are evidence of an affectionate irreverent interest in Chinese artistic traditions. (Hans Zimmer�۪s score is a witty pastiche that includes some choice �۪70s-style chopsocky riffs as well as more stately pseudoclassical swatches.) The movie is an obvious parody of sword- and martial-arts wuxia movies but it also serves as an invitation to young audiences who may find that Po�۪s antics have sparked an appetite for the more grown-up pleasures of movies like ���Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon�۝ or ���Curse of the Golden Flower.�۝" ���Kung Fu Panda 2 �۝ directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson from a screenplay by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger succumbs to its own crippling confusion. The first ���Kung Fu Panda �۝ released in 2008 was a rambunctious whimsical blend of action jokiness and sentiment lifted above the kiddie-cartoon mean by its shiny playful look and Mr. Black�۪s endlessly adaptable charm. The movie was also a big enough hit to make it unthinkable that DreamWorks Animation which ran poor Shrek into the ground would let it stand alone.

This film is not rated." who wrote the screenplay with Alexandru Baciu and Razvan Radulescu treats Raluca�۪s profession both as a mundane fact and as a sly deadpan joke a way of deflating almost from the outset whatever romantic and melodramatic associations cling to the subject of adultery. This is not to say that the film makes light of the potential and actual consequences of what Paul is doing ��� there is no shortage of strong painful and complicated emotion on the screen and also some low-key gimlet-eyed comedy ��� but rather that it refuses any hint of overstatement embellishment or wishful thinking.

After Christmas�۝ can feel at times like an uncomfortable intrusion into the intimacy of other people. Its opening scene records a moment of naked postcoital languor but our presence in the bedroom is in some ways less voyeuristic than what follows." After Christmas�۝ is brutally honest but not gratuitously cruel. It does not manipulate the audience into judgment pity or prurient curiosity. It sticks to the facts and circumscribes its action within the space of a week or so telling the middle portion of a much longer story." though nothing is exactly spelled out either so as you follow Paul through his routines you take the full measure of the man his circumstances and the people around him. His affectionate exasperation with his parents his dogged amiability during a chilly encounter with Raluca�۪s mother and his foolish infuriating insistence on acting like a nice guy at his lowest moments ��� all of this adds up to a portrait that is unsparing and unflattering without ever quite being unkind." all in all a fairly ordinary guy caught up in a drama that is equally banal and entirely of his own making.

Mr. Allen�۪s treatment of this condition is gentle and wry. He can hardly be unaware that he himself is for much of his audience an object of nostalgic affection much the way Cole Porter among others is for Gil his alter ego. That a shared love of Porter�۪s music allows Gil to forge a connection in the present (and conceivably the future) with a young Parisian woman (L̩a Seydoux) is a sign that his fetishizing of bygone days has been based on a mistake. Paris is perpetually alive not because it houses the ghosts of the famous dead but because it is the repository and setting of so much of their work. And the purpose of all that old stuff is not to carry us into the past but rather to animate and enliven the present." �۝ Woody Allen�۪s charming new film imagines what would happen if that wish came true. It is marvelously romantic even though ��� or precisely because ��� it acknowledges the disappointment that shadows every genuine expression of romanticism. The film has the inspired silliness of some of Mr. Allen�۪s classic comic sketches (most obviously ���A Twenties Memory �۝ in which the narrator�۪s nose is repeatedly broken by Ernest Hemingway) spiked with the rueful fatalism that has characterized so much of his later work." a tall laid-back iteration of the familiar Allen persona is Gil a perpetually dissatisfied Hollywood screenwriter trying to reinvigorate his youthful dreams of literary glory.

Instead you are hammered with one clich̩ after another from the architecture of Asgard with its floating stone staircases and vast vaulted chambers to the computer-generated monsters." and maybe even something to see. But ���Thor�۝ is an example of the programmed triumph of commercial calculation over imagination. A postcredits teaser gives viewers who have lingered in the theater a taste of ���The Avengers �۝ which at some future date will braid together the ���Iron Man �۝ ���Incredible Hulk�۝ and ���Thor�۝ franchises under the eye-patched aegis of Samuel L.

This is franchise building of the kind that has long been practiced by comic book publishers to keep their long-running serials fresh and their readership hooked." might and right love and duty ��� are duly checked off. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) incurs the wrath of his father Odin (Mr. Hopkins) and contends with his duplicitous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) a family drama set against the backdrop of war between the long-haired amber-lighted immortals of Asgard and their enemies the frost giants.

The movie cannot be an interesting appalling train wreck because it lacks the spoiled grandeur of ambition gone off the rails. You can�۪t sit and marvel (as it were) over what went wrong because nothing at the level of execution really has gone wrong. Mr. Branagh has not failed to make an interesting lively emotionally satisfying superhero movie because there is no evidence that he (or the gaggle of credited screenwriters or Paramount the sponsoring studio) ever intended to make any such thing. On the contrary the absolute and unbroken mediocrity of ���Thor�۝ is evidence of its success. This movie is not distinctively bad it is axiomatically bad." culture-dominating realm of big-budget moviemaking however the tactic of treating the price of a ticket as an installment-plan payment has more in common with a Ponzi scheme. The purpose of putting this movie in theaters is to make sure you and all your friends go to the next one and then the one after that." or to question the merits of Jane�۪s research. The particular magic of the superhero genre ��� in print and on screen ��� is its blending of the sublime and the silly. The challenge is in altering the ratio of gravity and wit to come up with something genuinely engaging." �۝ depositing my 3-D glasses in the appropriate bin I thought of seeking shelter: in a nearby bar; under a passing bus; in the velvet shadows of an art house playing the longest slowest most obscure movie imaginable. But when something like ���Thor�۝ comes to town there is really no refuge to be found in drink death or subtitles and so I tried to reason myself out of the leaden gloom that lay upon my soul as heavy as Mjolnir. (That�۪s Thor�۪s magic hammer for those not versed in Marvelized Norse mythology.)" I said to myself it�۪s only a movie! It isn�۪t that bad right? Look at the bright side. Anthony Hopkins is in it wearing a metal eye patch growling and bellowing the way he always does when the money is right. And there is also Idris Elba covered in gold armor looking like a cross between the Wall Street bull and an Oscar statuette. Speaking of which who else should turn up but the elusive Natalie Portman? She plays an astrophysicist named Jane and as far as I could tell does all her own astrophysics without the aid of a double. Ms. Portman�۪s cute-nerd sidekick is Kat Dennings and their nerd mentor is Stellan Skarsgard who at this point must be a leading candidate for the Nobel Prize in Pretend Science. ���Thor�۝ was directed by Kenneth Branagh who has read a lot of Shakespeare.

The bulk of the film looks like a quiet domestic melodrama involving a Japanese villager and her husband just returned from the Sino-Japanese wars." the clearest involve the way in which appeals to patriotic self-sacrifice fuel the war machine and the distance between propaganda and reality. The wife cycles among pity love and hatred for her formerly domineering husband a battlefield rapist revered in the village as a ���war god.�۝ Doing her new home-front duties of caring for and servicing her babylike hero she gradually turns the tables physically and psychologically.

In some ways they are communing with the dead summoning up the eternally lost. For his part Mr. Herzog uses the paintings to riff on the origin of art at one point connecting overlapping images of horses ��� some of which with their open mouths convey a sense of movement ��� to cinema itself.

As the wistful title of the documentary indicates he moves in a realm beyond empiricism in a world of dreams and stories." previous artists ��� those who first picked up a bit of charcoal say and scraped it on a stone ��� but the Chauvet paintings are among the earliest known. The cave was discovered in December 1994 by three French cavers Jean-Marie Chauvet ��liette Brunel Deschamps and Christian Hillaire. Following an air current coming from the cliff they dug and crawled their way into the cave which had been sealed tight for some 20 000 years. After finally making their way to an enormous chamber Ms. Deschamps held up her lamp and seeing an image of a mammoth cried out ���They were here �۝ a glorious moment of discovery that closed the distance between our lost human past and our present." and ordinary visitors were barred to protect it as Mr. Herzog explains in his distinctive voice-over from the kind of damage done to other prehistoric caverns. Being not remotely ordinary he persuaded the government to allow him and a tiny crew to join the researchers who visit the cave to plumb its secrets. A late-act revelation in the movie that a Chauvet attraction is in the works suggests that tourist dollars might explain why he was allowed in. The cave is already a regional attraction (there is an exhibition nearby) and certainly the movie is a fabulous bit of advertising that may even help France�۪s bid to have Chauvet designated a Unesco World Heritage site." �۝ an inside look at the astonishing Cave of Chauvet-Pont-d�۪Arc ��� and in 3-D too. In southern France about 400 miles from Paris the limestone cave contains a wealth of early paintings perhaps from as long ago as 32 000 years. Here amid gleaming stalactites and stalagmites and a carpet of animal bones beautiful images of horses gallop on walls alongside bison and a ghostly menagerie of cave lions cave bears and woolly mammoths. Multiple red palm prints of an early artist adorn one wall as if to announce the birth of the first auteur." an often brilliant filmmaker of fiction and nonfiction who has mellowed into a borderline self-parodying figure disarming (and famous) enough for a guest turn on ���The Simpsons.�۝ The cave largely keeps his more indulgently shticky side in check save for a needlessly obfuscating coda set in a freaky research center where albino crocodiles swim in the runoff from nuclear reactor plants. ���Cave of Forgotten Dreams�۝ is certainly an imperfect reverie. The 3-D is sometimes less than transporting and the chanting voices in the composer Ernst Reijseger�۪s new-agey score tended to remind me of my last spa massage.

As the smooth-handed director of photography Peter Zeitlinger wields the camera Mr. Herzog walks and even crawls for your viewing pleasure. He�۪s an agreeable sometimes characteristically funny guide whether showing you the paintings or talking with the men and women who study them. As evident from his other documentaries like ���Encounters at the End of the World �۝ set in Antarctica he also has a talent for tapping into the poetry of the human soul finding people who range freely in this world and others like the circus performer turned anthropologist here who night after night dreamed of lions after visiting the cave."

The journey is difficult meandering and pleasurably eccentric as a short fight with the opposition leads to an extended lope through a deep forest. There they pick up an unexpected addition Koyata (Yusuke Iseya) the final assassin whom they find imprisoned in a basket dangling from a tree. A broadly comic figure covered in dirt and rags the rubber-limbed Koyata provides some of the movie�۪s easier laughs but on the battlefield proves a fighter-philosopher. In the end when bodies and blood cover every inch of ground he shows that the way of the warrior isn�۪t a romantic and diverting fiction but an emblem of a harrowing brutal reality." unexpectedly moving story of love and blood the samurai movie ���13 Assassins�۝ opens with a dignified man seated alone in a large courtyard. Perfectly centered in the shot he says nothing his face a ferocious mask. But words are immaterial given his open shirt and the blade in his hand. The Japanese director Takashi Miike has no qualms about letting the red run down the screen. Here though instead of showing the blade sinking in he moves in closer letting the scene play out in the man�۪s crumbling face the gray sky framing him as the moist tearing sounds of the knife doing its terrible work fill the air." justifying the ensuing violence that will wash blood away with blood. This sanguineous deluge comes but all in good time because first Mr. Miike has to round up his avengers the 13 warriors of the film�۪s title. It�۪s a sign of difficult samurai times that the leader of the group Shinzaemon Shimada (the great Koji Yakusho) enters perched on a fishing ladder a pole in his hand. It�۪s unclear if he�۪s fishing for food or leisure but the point is that he�۪s fishing not fighting having resigned himself to a quiet twilight.

But for those not schooled in Japan�۪s past (or period movies) it helps to know that during the relatively peaceful Edo period (roughly 1615 to 1868) the role of the samurai changed as the way of the warrior became the way of the heavily controlled and bureaucratized warrior. Rather than pile on the details or on-screen exegesis the screenwriter Daisuke Tengan (working from an original story by Shoichirou Ikemiya) instead sketches in the historical context with bits of meaningful dialogue as when Shinzaemon ruefully explains that he had all but given up on having a noble death.

Wrapping truth in a blanket of artifice the director uses actors to lip-sync prerecorded interviews with Dunbar�۪s family and friends producing an effect that�۪s at once aggressively theatrical and devastatingly intimate. Viewer and confidante become one as the actors recite their lines directly to the camera their bodies positioned and lighted to form visual punctuation that pierces more deeply than any faithful re-enactment." in this case a lack of it ��� on personal judgment.

The depth and complexity of her anger is both a product and a mirror of her native country�۪s self-destructive pathology and as the full horror of her life is disclosed she becomes in her children�۪s eyes and the audience�۪s as grand and tragic as the heroine of an opera." sometimes graphically conveyed." a fellow member of a global fraternity of dutiful document filers and data organizers ��� represents a way of engaging the world that is fundamentally opposed to the chaos and cruelty that defined Nawal�۪s homeland during her time there.

It is nearly impossible to imagine him either subjected to or responsible for any kind of atrocity. Mr. Girard one of Quebec�۪s finest actors has a dumpling face and genial demeanor made for comedy and he turns Lebel into a marvelously paradoxical figure. Even in French the phrase ���heroic Canadian notary�۝ sounds like a punch line but it fits this man exactly and also illuminates one of the movies crucial themes." �۝ a film very much occupied with some of the grisly realities of recent history nonetheless has the structure and some of the atmosphere of an ancient folk tale.

The perspective of Jeanne and Simon modern Canadians wholly unaware of their roots in that history makes the film into something more elusive and complex a meditation on memory and identity that recalls some of the recent films of Atom Egoyan. How are the twins to understand their relationship with their mother in the light of what they learn about her? What does it mean for them to be so intimately and yet obscurely tied to an inheritance of rape torture assassination and terror? What could help them understand this legacy and move beyond it?" the often painful ways that bonds of blood connect strangers and enemies.

I wondered as ���Water for Elephants�۝ drew to its dull tidy conclusion." that the movie fails to develop a sense of wonder. After all what is a circus but a surreal pageant celebrating the animal side of human nature?" which takes over after an introduction by a rheumy-eyed Hal Holbrook (wonderful as always) playing the aged Jacob. Mr. Pattinson�۪s simplistic narration unfortunately affects the gee-whiz language of a grade-school reading book. Each time his voice breaks in to advance the plot the movie grinds to a halt. Mr. Pattinson is only partly to blame for the fatuity of a character who even in the novel is really a generic male ing̩nue with no personality. In the film there is nothing about him to suggest a Depression-era youth whose parents�۪ deaths have thrown him into the world without a safety net. He is more like a ���Gossip Girl�۝-ready 21st-century heartthrob who has exhausted his trust fund." the beaten and mistreated Rosie is a heroine for all seasons.

Her mother intercedes. ���Control yourself proud child �۝ she advises. ���And submit.�۝ And so Marie does." more somber side of Mr. Tavernier. It�۪s an eerily calm scene at once ugly and visually striking and almost too handsomely composed for the carnage. Immediately however Mr. Tavernier brings the horrors of war within ghastly close distance with a skirmish in a nearby barn that leaves a pregnant woman dead a sword in her belly and a soldier of God Comte de Chabannes (Lambert Wilson wonderful) renouncing the righteousness of a religious war. Dropping to his knees in wordless horror he busily tries to clean a blade as bloodied as Macbeth�۪s." �۝ a rousing amalgam of ambition moods and genre conceits looks like one of those old-fashioned diversions in which swords clang as bosoms heave with sweet passion. The pretty bosom of the title character played by M̩lanie Thierry tends to swell rather gently but it also rides so high in her dresses that it evokes the temptations displayed in the windows of Parisian patisseries. The French director Bertrand Tavernier deploys some smart ideas in this film a period story about wars on the battlefield and those closer to home but there�۪s something a bit goatish in his attention to some female charms." a person emerges from the haze but however agreeable she never becomes the scintillating companion that so many men Chabannes included insist she is. It doesn�۪t help that Ms. Thierry is out-acted by the rest of the terrific cast including by Rapha��l Personnaz as the Duke of Anjou (and future king) and Judith Chemla as his mother the queen who with eyebrows as bushy as caterpillars amusingly takes the story hostage briefly. This doesn�۪t diminish the film�۪s pleasures yet it may explain why although it�۪s called ���The Princess of Montpensier�۝ Mr. Tavernier lavishes so much time on Chabannes a dashing figure a master of the sword and pen both who can find medicinal herbs read the stars and strum a lute.

The prince�۪s scheming father the Duke of Montpensier (Michel Vuillermoz) clinches the deal with the marquis when he throws in a parcel of land." and wife to husband and to other men of high rank. Yet while the larger backdrop is the religious war the battle that consumes so much attention onscreen is that between wife and husband. Forced to yield to her father ��� and to the other men engaged in that transaction known as her marriage ��� Marie is handed from one player to the next in a struggle in which she is pawn and prize alike. Once married the prince takes her to a family castle one distant enough from the war to keep her safe but also secluded enough to keep her isolated. Almost shortly after though he departs again for the war leaving his former tutor Chabannes to watch over her."

Mr. Tavernier likes big bold gestures and he regularly fills the screen with slashes of exciting motion the galloping horses streaking across the image with the camera in pursuit. But among the hard-ridden horses the arriving and departing messengers the smoke that wafts over the battlefields and the intrigues that race through the castles like a lethal virus he makes room for Marie. A pouty neo-Bardot beauty Ms. Thierry is hypnotically transfixing but she takes a while to warm to partly because it�۪s some time before her character comes into focus. This isn�۪t her fault; as Jessica Rabbit would say she�۪s been drawn that way: young spoiled only rudimentarily educated Marie is a beautiful blur."

But rather than trust the audience�۪s ability to think through the thorny historical and ideological issues at the heart of the story Mr. Redford and the screenwriter James Solomon descend perhaps inadvertently into Confederate apologetics.

Colm Meaney as the head of the tribunal is less sinister but hardly sympathetic and the behind-the-scenes heavy Secretary of War Edwin M.

It�۪s a bright and pretty tableau ��� the dark color of the men�۪s skin is beautifully set against the shimmering blue water ��� but there�۪s something else here a shiver of unease.

Soon after he loses his job however Adam begins to direct his resentment at Abdel who still works at the pool. Jealousy and anger gnaw at Adam even as the war approaches until the two blur together and one man�۪s resentment bleeds into a country�۪s madness." though his silences can be telling. He works as a pool man in a modest hotel in Chad where during the day he watches over splashing children and lazily sunbathing adults and not much else.

His employer calls him by his given name Adam (played by Youssouf Djaoro a tall and cool drink of water) but everyone else calls him Champ a title reflecting a past glory that he wears as proudly as his dazzlingly white uniform." Adam himself tends not to frame his life in such grand terms ��� he�۪s too busy living and then struggling ��� and the film doesn�۪t put many words in his mouth.

He left the country some 20 years later. He knows war though he also knows cinema: he studied film in Paris and his admiration for Ozu (and by extension a familiarity with classic art cinema) is evident in the stillness inside the frame and in how meaning emerges in daily conversations and the silences between words. The film�۪s pulse feels timed to the rhythms of ordinary life rather than to any received concept of slow-cinema pacing." tender finally wrenching story of an individual at the intersection of the personal and the political. It�۪s a modest film if only in scale and apparent budget about some of the greatest questions in life like the existence of God our capacity to see beyond our own vanity and the legacies of fathers both blood and state." and his defeat foreshadows much of what comes next. Returning to the locker room he pauses in front of a mirror and sucks in his rounded gut. It�۪s an amusing scene this image of an older man�۪s vanity yet it�۪s also significant because it�۪s a moment of narcissistic reflection with far-reaching implications. Deflated by his trouncing Adam sulks begins doing push-ups and stares at his handsome son who with his bright smile and young muscles also works at the pool though significantly as his father�۪s underling.

What is supposed to be Arthur�۪s maturation is actually regression as if he were trading in the whiskey bottle for the baby bottle. He rejects the corruptions of adulthood imposed by his ruthless mother and his sexually predatory fianc̩e in favor of a relationship characterized by unthreatening childlike innocence.

It doesn�۪t just hit the road it also wobbles and weaves and executes a diabolically jaunty victory lap leaving a long bloody smear in its increasingly brutal wake. This being a conceptual horror flick the tire also runs wild while some onlookers play the Greek chorus and in-house audience both commenting on the movie as it happens. ���It�۪s already boring �۝ says one.

Quentin Dupieux working with an English-speaking cast and his mute rubber star has an explanation. Shot in an atmospherically desolate pocket of the Mojave Desert in Southern California the movie opens with a question mark: a car driving into some chairs on a road. After knocking each chair over the car comes to a stop and a cop Lieutenant Chad (Stephen Spinella) scrambles out of the trunk.

Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes." where a winsome traveler Sheila (Roxane Mesquida) becomes the latest horror-movie heroine to parade around in a bath towel for the delectation of the villain (and off-screen audience). Also in on the action are a smart boy (Remi Thorne) and his dad (David Bowe) who are mirrored by a father and son in the on-screen audience. Together they some cops and a twitchy type (Jack Plotnick as the resident Renfield) ping off one another in between the tire carnage. The chattering chorus meanwhile repeatedly interrupts the thin narrative which has a modest highfalutin rationale (each interruption frustrates your desire to see what happens next) but really just lays the ground for some nasty payback." by embracing irrationality as his operating principle (or at least by pretending to) Mr. Dupieux lets himself off the narrative hook. If you want to know why the tire called Robert in the credits if nowhere else rises from the desert floor one day like a Michelin Phoenix well too bad. Although the tire�۪s name and a late short tantalizingly flashback ��� by then we know the tire makes decisions so it�۪s no surprise that it has memories ��� suggest assorted story possibilities (an accident might be to blame as might a briefly glimpsed tire holocaust) you need your imagination to fill in the blanks. In the end though only one question and one answer matter: Why then does the tire kill? Because it can." or so it often seems in movies where bloodlust (that of the monster and filmmaker both) is rarely sated. The villain in ���Rubber�۝ is no different and after taking care of a bottle and a can the tire next takes out a scorpion and a rabbit before moving onto bigger bloodier more recalcitrant prey. Making the most of his lightweight digital camera Mr. Dupieux often shoots at the tire�۪s height to convey a sense of its agency if not its thinking. At times the camera nestles so close to the tire you can count the treads and even see it (gulp) breathe. (Shot with a Canon 5D a single-lens-reflex camera that takes stills and video the movie has been handsomely transferred to 35 millimeter for the theatrical release.)" after shuddering to life or rather to motion. First seen half-submerged in sand the tire starts to tremble as if newly awakened (or suffering from a seizure) and then struggles upright only to fall repeatedly bringing to mind the first tentative steps of a newborn foal. But this is no charming peaceable creature. It�۪s a totem of American industrial might that having been carelessly or purposely forgotten has become something more than junk blighting the landscape. And now it�۪s on the loose (smoothly maneuvered by the off-screen magicians holding the remote control) an uncanny turn of affairs that the tire tests with nimble moves and then ��� shades of its will to power ��� by rolling over other refuse."

You can learn something about folk remedies superstitions and agricultural practices about how residents of the valley gather snails treat respiratory ailments and manufacture fuel to heat their homes and cook their food.

Using the sweeping perspectives afforded by the precipitously hilly terrain he composes frames with the skill of a painter and the wit of a silent-film maestro." but otherwise human existence seems to follow an ancient pattern.

Beige-brown and speckled with crosshatch marks the Migoo brings to mind a hairless yeti and the Michelin Man. He�۪s a joyous seemingly anarchic character if one with a higher purpose and the director Jacques-R̩my Girerd does his most vivid work bringing this bearish critter to life whether the Migoo is racing up the side of a cliff or slipping through the earth as if it were water." the movie opens with a man Pedro (voiced by Jesse Corti) peering into the night sky and crying out for Mia (Amanda Misquez) the young daughter he�۪s left behind while he helps to build an exclusive complex in a forest. The brains behind the development is Jekhide (John DiMaggio) a bully in a cream-colored suit who�۪s more consumed by greed than by being a good father to his son Aldrin (Vincent Agnello) an imbalance that as even a wee moviegoer knows must be righted.

Mr. Depardieu a political tribune of the aggrieved proletariat ��� set a tone of sly high-spirited sincerity that is matched by the rest of the cast which includes Fabrice Luchini Karin Viard Judith Godr̬che and J̩r̩mie Renier. These able actors tackle a busy tale of marital discord and class conflict that takes place in the politically anxious year of 1977 and is set in motion by labor unrest at the umbrella factory run by Robert Pujol (Mr. Luchini)." the machinery of boulevard farce lumbers into motion ornamented by Mr. Ozon�۪s fussy touches of pastiche. The Pujol factory cannot help calling to mind Jacques Demy�۪s ���Umbrellas of Cherbourg �۝ which made Ms. Deneuve an international movie star in 1964 but ���Potiche�۝ is more thoroughly infused with a later more decadent era of French politics and pop culture.

They comport themselves with a beguiling blend of panache and precision." even as it goes on a bit too long. Mr. Ozon creates a look and mood of high retrocomedy but his pacing within scenes and from one to the next is slow and clumsy preventing the plot from gathering the momentum it needs. While he clearly enjoys messing around with a silly antiquated play he is too polite to offer the strong revisionist interpretation that the material invites.

Mr. Ozon a prolific filmmaker has also perhaps intentionally approximated the stodgy good cheer that often distinguishes lavish star-studded stage revivals of beloved old chestnuts. You suspect before long that there is no strong reason for this production to exist but it is reasonably good fun all the same."

From the very first pages of Charlotte Bront�ǉ۪s 1847 book Jane embodies virtues that might be off-putting if they were not so persuasive and if her story were not such a marvelous welter of grim suffering and smoldering passion.

Edward Rochester is an even wilder brew of contradictions ��� so does Bront�ǉ۪s ���Jane Eyre�۝ mash up genres and effects with mesmerizing virtuosity. The novel�۪s blend of Christian piety Gothic horror barely suppressed eroticism and high-toned comedy satisfied readerly appetites in the Victorian era and ever after. It is hardly surprising that this book has inspired so many film adaptations over the last hundred years the latest of which stars Mia Wasikowska as Jane the beleaguered governess." Jane (played as a child by Amelia Clarkson) nonetheless manages to cultivate her innate decency and bolster it with self-reliance. And the movie audience like the 19th-century novel-reading public can relish with only slight queasiness the sadomasochistic spectacle of boarding school cruelty." who nearly crushed Joan Fontaine in his overscaled embrace in the 1944 version and Michael Fassbender to his credit does not try.

It�۪s this blurring between the antagonists  as well as the flexibility of the story�۪s morals and meanings that make it work well for different readers and writers. In the 17th century Charles Perrault turned an oral folk tale  into ���Le Petit Chaperon Rouge �۝ and three centuries later Angela Carter gave the story a wicked feminist spin. Ms. Hardwicke doesn�۪t acknowledge ���The Company of Wolves �۝ Carter�۪s  brilliant retelling but it�۪s probable that she read it or saw Neil Jordan�۪s dreary 1984 big-screen adaptation." Father Solomon (Mr. Oldman) adds some busywork drama and action. Summoned to vanquish the computer-generated wolf (an underfed brother to the ludicrous lupine beasts in the ���Twilight�۝ franchise) the padre arrives with an armed multicultural entourage and in a flamboyant touch a torture chamber cum Easy-Bake Oven shaped like an elephant. (Unlucky prisoners are slow-roasted inside.) At one point Valerie worries with good reason that Father Solomon might mistake her for a witch. But this nod at historic female troubles doesn�۪t go anywhere largely because Valerie spends so much time negotiating between dueling loves Peter and a wealthier suitor Henry (Max Irons) while juggling her mother Suzette (Virginia Madsen rouged and Maybellined) and father Cesaire (Billy Burke)." Valerie as a child (Megan Charpentier) strolling about in trousers (the other girls are in dresses) while in voice-over Ms. Seyfried insists that she tried to be a good girl. But goodness had nothing to do with it as Mae West once quipped or so Ms. Hardwicke seems to want us to believe. Before long Valerie has run off with a boy pointedly named Peter (first D J Greenburg later Shiloh Fernandez with hair gel) and they�۪re frolicking in the forest and snaring a rabbit. Valerie urges Peter to slay the animal but he can�۪t or won�۪t and the sequence ends with her holding a knife to the bunny like a natural-born killer." �۝ Carter writes ���she was nobody�۪s meat.�۝ Her insouciance is thrilling. Ms. Hardwicke wants to have her feminism and fairy tale but Carter�۪s no-prisoners bad attitude is too far out for an entertainment like ���Red Riding Hood �۝ where only the appearance of girl power will finally do. Given this it�۪s worth noting that Ms. Hardwicke who is deeply enamored of aerial photography sends the camera repeatedly soaring over the landscape where sometimes a woman in a red cloak as vivid as blood walks with a man across the snowy expanse. It�۪s a striking image suggestive of freedom though perhaps it�۪s really just the guy who this little fairy-tale fugitive needs to escape from."

Calling himself in a contrived bit of whimsy a Gumshoot he takes photographs of paying strangers while hidden from their sight. The idea seems to be that clients will fork over dough to see what they look like in their everyday life as in the case of an older gentleman who strolls around his neighborhood chatting up the residents and greeting children and dogs. Theo assures the customer that he�۪s loved using the photos as so much proof and the old gent is happy to pay." among others Mr. De Palma and his master Alfred Hitchcock.

It�۪s a lovely vision a warm bath of humanity that you want to sink into and the only one left out in the cold is Theo. Poor guy or not. It�۪s too bad he consumes so much attention because what lingers here is less his self-destructive impulses or the sex-surveillance subplot than the realistic intimate scenes of him and Nat at home doing the hard work that happiness demands and that filmmakers sometimes forget can be reason enough for us to keep watching." some nice digital camerawork and an appealing cast ��� the likable Ms. Jones draws you in easily ��� Mr. Shapiro keeps you engaged even when his story falters. Theo turns out to be its weakest link simply because he�۪s too shallow a vessel for the narcissism (made literal in a scene of him staring into a mirror) with which he�۪s burdened. The problem isn�۪t that Theo isn�۪t especially good or interesting company if through no fault of Mr. Messina�۪s who doesn�۪t  try to appeal to your sympathies.

What�۪s best here are the intimate moments the arias and duets that bring out Ms. Zambello�۪s talent for making singers connect with the audience and with one another." there are no marquee names (this is opera and film: the people call out for stars!) and no grab-you-by-the-throat performances. In the title role the British mezzo-soprano Christine Rice sings with warmth and agility but she�۪s saddled with Ms. Zambello�۪s off-the-rack Carmenisms." and this is a straightforward filming of Ms. Zambello�۪s straightforward staging of Bizet�۪s opera. Even if it were in flat old 2-D you might wonder why so little had been done to accommodate the camera. The makeup for example no doubt reads in the last row of the Royal Opera House balcony but on screen it mostly looks globby." though there are a few nifty-silly effects: clasped hands that seem to come right into the audience; perspectives that give remarkable volume to figures in the foreground." if you�۪re in the market for a filmed version of ���Carmen �۝ you might prefer the Metropolitan Opera�۪s DVD with Elina Garanca in the lead role. It has only two dimensions but it�۪s better staged and Ms. Garanca is wonderful." though when the 3-D really pops it makes the singers look like holograms.

Carls; released by Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies. Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes." it sounds annoyingly coyly referential ��� something like a lizard-cowboy ���Shrek�۝ ��� but the spirit is closer to those old Bugs Bunny cartoons in which Bugs would cross paths with real movie stars or perform Wagnerian opera. In other words it is not self-conscious knowingness that drives ���Rango�۝ but rather a quirky and sincere enthusiasm for all the strange stuff that has piled up in the filmmakers�۪ heads over the years. Nor are they merely recycling. The desert environment has a washed-out eerie appearance entirely unlike the plasticized landscapes of most animation ��� the great cinematographer Roger Deakins who shot the American West for Joel and Ethan Coen in ���No Country for Old Men�۝ and ���True Grit �۝ is credited as a visual consultant ��� and the critters who inhabit it are arrestingly grotesquely hairy slimy and scaly." bugs rodents and less identifiable species that collectively enact a story of greed treachery and bravery as old as the West itself. Our lizard a stranger in town takes on the name Rango and finds himself appointed sheriff and also romantically drawn to a plucky frontier gal named Beans (Isla Fisher). (Abigail Breslin Ray Winstone and Harry Dean Stanton are among the other notable voices of Dirt.) The town is drying up and the mayor (Ned Beatty) may not have the best interests of the citizens at heart." with sensationally inventive technical means tethered more often than not to drab and cynical imaginative ends. The perennial Pixar exception tends to prove a dreary rule: as animated movies claim an ever bigger share of money and attention ��� drawing cross-generational demographically diverse audiences more readily than most other films ��� they rely more and more on manic synthetic formulas." �۝ a tongue-in-cheek western (a lizard�۪s tongue at that) directed by Gore Verbinski who is best known for helping to turn a theme-park ride (Disney World�۪s ���Pirates of the Caribbean�۝) into a dizzyingly successful movie franchise. But the odd thing about ���Rango�۝ is that unlike so many of its peers it is odd. In spite of a profile that should place it alongside ���Megamind�۝ and ���Despicable Me�۝ and the long list of other overblown have-fun-or-else cartoons this rambling anarchic tale is gratifyingly fresh and eccentric. Much of the time you don�۪t quite know where it is going which is high praise indeed given the slick predictability that governs most other entertainments of its kind." Isla Fisher (Beans) Abigail Breslin (Priscilla) Alfred Molina (Roadkill) Bill Nighy (Rattlesnake Jake) Stephen Root (Doc/Merrymack) Harry Dean Stanton (Balthazar) Ray Winstone (Bad Bill) Ned Beatty (Mayor) and Timothy Olyphant (the Spirit of the West)." �۝ which may take place entirely within its hero�۪s head ��� that kind of ambiguity worked in ���Inception�۝ and ���Black Swan �۝ so why not here? ��� is about the appetite for myths and stories whether or not they make sense. It is about the worlds we dream inside our fishbowls helped by the weird reflections on the walls." culminating in a showdown with a villainous rattlesnake (Bill Nighy) and including a voice cameo that I won�۪t spoil though the end credits might. Those interested in narrative coherence may feel a bit let down at the end; I confess I wanted a tighter gathering of loose ends and a more thorough explanation of the politics of water and real estate in the fast-changing American West." smoking and killing. It is a western after all." rather out of images and ideas that have been floating around in the collective dream life for as long as most of us can remember. Mr. Verbinski and his colleagues (John Logan wrote the script and James Ward Byrkit shares story credit) rummage through a grab bag of allusions and homages many of which seem inspired more by genuine fandom than by the impulse to be clever. There is an early blink-and-you-miss-it nod to the memory of Hunter S. Thompson who is a personal touchstone for Mr. Depp and is also connected to the iconography of the West that ���Rango�۝ sets out to explore. That includes not only the expected tumbleweeds and cactuses and dusty rock formations but also a hallucinatory desert tradition encompassing Carlos Castaneda and Wile E. Coyote." since Mr. Verbinski especially in the first installment of the ���Pirates of the Caribbean�۝ series showed a distinctive visual style and a genuinely off-beat sensibility. He was helped immeasurably in all of the ���Pirates�۝ pictures by the decorative whimsy of Mark McCreery (the production designer here) and by the uninhibited goofiness of Johnny Depp who turned Jack Sparrow into a new pop-culture archetype. Both Mr. McCreery and Mr. Depp are crucial to the look and rhythm of ���Rango �۝ keeping it vigorously strange almost until the end when the movie decides to go for the safe commercial action-extravaganza wrap-up." a half-dozen times a year parents and children line up for overscaled noisy genre pastiches crammed with yammering movie-star voice work eye-straining action sequences and tacked-on sermons about the importance of being yourself following your dream or sticking by your friends and family. Even at their best (again noting the Pixar exception) these movies are like theme-park rides and other big-ticket corporate amusements ��� thrilling while they last and then quickly forgotten." our reptilian hero drags himself to the desolate town of Dirt a bleak bone-dry place that is nonetheless swimming in cinematic associations. As Hans Zimmer�۪s score chews up great mouthfuls of Ennio Morricone-style spaghetti the town�۪s varmint population evokes movies ranging from the westerns of John Ford to ���Chinatown�۝ and ���The Big Sleep.�۝" a domesticated lizard with a Hawaiian shirt and an active imagination in the terrarium tank he shares with a broken doll torso and a wind-up plastic fish. This minimal world is a stage for him and he struts about on it like a scaly provincial trouper acting out dramatic scenarios and scenes from Shakespeare to dispel the boredom of benign captivity. The blank abstract space this creature inhabits calls our attention to the fanciful nature of the movie itself as it begins to conjure an antic improbable world out of nothing."

Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes." �۝ drilling down to where it hurts (he would rather entertain than pain you) he skates on the gray-blue surfaces of his film with confidence. Along with his likable confidently sexy leads and an excellent troika in Mr. Slattery Anthony Mackie and Terence Stamp Mr. Nolfi keeps the film balanced between sincerity and self-conscious amusement rarely faltering in tone. With their cool-cat hats and tailored suits Mr. Mackie Mr. Slattery and Mr. Stamp look as if they�۪re on hiatus from Mr. Slattery�۪s AMC show ���Mad Men�۝ (or extras in ���North by Northwest�۝). Like Mr. Damon and Ms. Blunt they can bring you into this world because Mr. Nolfi never takes his eye off the human stakes." um adjustments to the original story ��� David�۪s world doesn�۪t disintegrate it pauses like a stuck clock ��� though his largest shift is turning a metaphysical speculation into an existential crisis. After bombing out of the political game David enters into business with his old campaign manager Charlie (Michael Kelly who could be Eliot Spitzer�۪s cousin). Then one strange day David stumbles into a boardroom crowded with immobilized colleagues and busily moving strangers some wearing gray suits others dressed in more menacing black. He tries to flee but is caught by the interlopers one of whom Richardson (John Slattery) explains that by meeting Elise David is not following their plan. Like any sane person he responds by trying to make a run for it again but that�۪s not in their plan either." including car crashes." beyond the brilliance of its ideas is that his unembellished writing style leaves them room to make the stories visually their own. For his directing debut Mr. Nolfi whose screenwriting credits include ���Ocean�۪s Twelve�۝ and ���The Bourne Ultimatum �۝ appears to have turned to the classics for guidance specifically ���Orph̩e �۝ Jean Cocteau�۪s sublime 1949 version of the myth of Eurydice and Orpheus. From the costumes of Richardson�۪s goggled henchmen to the way David tells Elise to hold onto him so that they can pass through otherworldly portals Mr. Nolfi samples from ���Orph̩e�۝ to his advantage adding a layer of pleasure for cinephiles while keeping the mood up. As it turns out romance for grown-ups isn�۪t dead in Hollywood ��� it�۪s just been on extended leave." �۝ a fast sure film about finding and keeping love across time and space. Good question. If the fates allow ��� or perhaps as in this very enjoyable movie the men in gray suits and fedoras permit and ���things go according to plan�۝ ��� you should be hearing more from Mr. Nolfi a screenwriter turned director who has brightened the season with a witty mix of science-fiction metaphysics and old-fashioned fluttery romance." �۝ the Philip K. Dick short story that is the movie�۪s credited inspiration. First published in 1954 it centers on one Ed Fletcher a salaryman who arriving at work one day finds that the world has temporarily turned to gray ash the people included. In short unceremonious frightening order he discovers that his life ��� his reality ��� has been adjusted by some mystery men running an exceedingly specialized enterprise. Written in Dick�۪s characteristically unpretty blunt style the story earns its punch from the idea that the known world the world of appearances dissolves at the touch of a finger. It collapses into dust." who at this stage in his shining career does little wrong plays David Norris a Democratic Brooklyn son and favorite in the New York race for Senate with intimations of the young Robert F. Kennedy in each toothy grin. Set in the present the story opens with David sprinting toward probable victory the booming sound track swift pace and editing mirroring the exuberance of his own great expectations. It�۪s all going so well until a tabloid publishes a moderately embarrassing if damaging old photograph of him. The photo torpedoes his campaign but right before conceding the race he meets Elise (Emily Blunt) a dancer who innocently leads him down a rabbit hole kinked with twists and turns." Emily Blunt (Elise Sellas) Anthony Mackie (Harry) John Slattery (Richardson) Michael Kelly (Charlie Traynor) and Terence Stamp (Thompson)." a situation that leads to tricky niftily staged cat-and-mouse chase scenes involving some amusing creative geography. But David is as much a captive to Elise as a fugitive from those meddlesome strangers and he�۪s also caught between seemingly contradictory forces: his ambition and his heart. In other words despite the title the film is less a freak-out about the nature of existence (the world of ash that Dick wrote about) and more about a struggle for love a more familiar (at the movies) if essential fight. Whether running or kissing or running and kissing (well almost) Mr. Damon and Ms. Blunt turn romance into a palpable race."

And yet while it takes pains to be historically authentic the film closely based on the true story of a group of French Cistercian Trappist monks caught up (and ultimately killed) in the violence also keeps an eye on less worldly temporal concerns." devoting themselves to contemplation service and humility. Their conversation is quiet minimal and gentle making the occasional spark of anger or glimmer of humor all the more notable.

News reaches the abbey of other killings and the local civil and military authorities try to persuade Christian to abandon the abbey. Several of the other monks are tempted to leave and some of the most dramatic scenes in the movie show them debating the merits of various courses of action. Christian is scolded for asserting his authority without honoring the order�۪s communitarian ethic and what seems like a beside-the-point procedural debate touches on the film�۪s deepest spiritual and ethical concerns." coincidentally enough in ���Black Swan �۝ a movie so utterly different from ���Of Gods and Men�۝ that they barely seem to belong to the same medium. In ���Black Swan �۝ Tchaikovsky delivers the extravagant melodrama that is the film�۪s entire reason for being whereas here his lush emotive orchestration emphasizes the utter absence of such wanton emotionalism. And yet it also serves as a reminder that even in wartime and even in lives governed by restraint and self-denial there is an essential need for beauty feeling and art." Christian (Lambert Wilson) spends nearly as much time with the Koran as with the Bible and he regards himself as neither an interloper nor a native but rather as a sincere and dedicated friend of Algeria. Though it is not mentioned in the film the actual Brother Christian who came from a distinguished military family served in the French Army during the Algerian War. His decision to stay in that country after taking his monastic vows represented a stubborn and passionate belief in the possibility of reconciliation. (A richly detailed and moving account of his life and the fate of his abbey can be found in ���The Monks of Tibhirine �۝ a 2002 book by John Kiser.)

Running time: 2 hours." but movies that try to illuminate religious experience from within constitute a tiny and exalted tradition in which Mr. Beauvois�۪s story of faith under duress clearly belongs. Its more-or-less recent peers include movies as diverse as Carlos Reygadas�۪s ���Silent Light �۝ from Mexico Philip Gr̦ning�۪s sublime documentary ���Into Great Silence �۝ Bruno Dumont�۪s ���Hadewijch�۝ and ���The Apostle �۝ Robert Duvall�۪s acute and sympathetic study of the glorious contradictions of American Evangelical Christianity." most of the film�۪s music comes from the monks�۪ chanted prayers and the cries of the muezzins at nearby mosques. The notable exception ��� the only time recorded secular music is heard ��� comes during a meal when the residents of the abbey sit and listen to a famous passage from Tchaikovsky�۪s ���Swan Lake�۝ and lose themselves as completely in aesthetic reverie as they otherwise do in religious devotion." an actor who has directed and written a handful of features is clearly fascinated by the radicalism of the monks an expression of religious zeal whose extremism lies in its insistence on preserving peace and dignity in all circumstances. But though his sympathy for the Trappists is evident the film does not treat them as saints or as mouthpieces for any particular theology. Rather ���Of Gods and Men�۝ works to balance the two terms of its title and treats the relationship between them as a grave and complex mystery."

Their future looks grim even hopeless. (In Kenya home to Elsa of the popular 1966 movie ���Born Free �۝ wild lions might be wiped out within one to two decades.)

Kim Hyung-seok; edited by Kim Hyun; production design by Sihn Jeom-hui; produced by Lee Joon-dong; released by Kino International. In Korean with English subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 19 minutes. This film is not rated. WITH: Yun Jung-hee (Mija) Lee David (Wook) and Kim Hira (M. Kang)." as becomes obvious  when the father of one of the other accused rapists contacts Mija and sweeps her off to an afternoon meeting at a restaurant. Together he and four other fathers have decided ��� with the school�۪s blessing ��� to give the dead girl�۪s mother a large sum of cash a bribe for her silence. What�۪s done is done one man more or less says as another pours the beer. (���Ladies first �۝ he says offering Mija a glass.) ���Although I feel sorry for the dead girl �۝ a father says ���now�۪s the time for us to worry about our own boys.�۝ Her face empty Mija sits wordlessly. And then she drifts outside opens her little notebook and begins writing: ���Blood ... a flower as red as blood.�۝" these older people who have come to the cultural center to learn. Perhaps because they have chosen to be there they don�۪t have the look of sullen resentment and cultivated boredom that glazes the faces of the high school students glimpsed now and again. Instead these latter-day bards gaze at the man who has come to say something to them about art and maybe life. Instead he holds up an apple and talks about seeing." a 66-year-old raising her only grandson Wook (Lee David) in a cramped cluttered apartment in an unnamed city the pursuit of poetry becomes a pastime and then a passion and finally a means of transcendence. At first though it�۪s a pleasant distraction from an otherwise mundane existence if also a way to exercise a mind that as a doctor tells Mija early on has begun to slip slowly away from her. Out of fear or confusion she keeps the diagnosis to herself and almost from herself telling neither Wook nor his mother who lives in another city. Instead she dons the poet�۪s cap. ���I do have a poet�۪s vein �۝ she says chattering into her cellphone. ���I do like flowers and say odd things.�۝" this woman with her white hats tidily arranged scarves and vanity. But like this subtle transfixing film she draws you in. Crucial in this respect is Ms. Yun�۪s performance a tour de force of emotional complexity that builds through restraint and like Mr. Lee�۪s unadorned visual style earns rather than demands your attention. (His earlier features include ���Secret Sunshine.�۝) The shabby rooms and ordinary streets in ���Poetry�۝ are shown without fanfare more like statements of facts than pieces of an evolving narrative. Yet it�۪s the prosaic quality of this world its ordinariness that makes the story�۪s shocks reverberate so forcefully beginning with the revelation that Wook and five friends all boys have been implicated in the death of a classmate a girl first seen floating face down in a river in the opening scene." Mija asks her poetry teacher with almost comic innocence ���When does a ���poetic inspiration�۪ come?�۝ It doesn�۪t he replies you must beg for it. ���Where must I go?�۝ she persists. He says that she must wander around seek it out but that it�۪s there right where she stands. In truth there is poetry everywhere including in those who pass through her life at times invisibly like the handicapped retiree (Kim Hira) she cares for part time a husk of a man whom she will at last also see clearly. The question that she doesn�۪t ask is the why of art. She doesn�۪t have to because the film ��� itself an example of how art allows us to rise out of ourselves to feel for another through imaginative sympathy ��� answers that question beautifully." which begins with an image of rushing water partly because ��� like the young child on the riverbank whose viewpoint you share ��� you initially can�۪t make out what it is that you�۪re looking at until the body floats  into the frame in close-up. The corpse belongs to a teenage girl who accused  some classmates of having serially raped her. On the most brutal level her body introduces a mystery. Yet there�۪s more to the opening including the children clustered on the riverbank ominously doubled by the teenagers who  helped put that body in the water and whose indifference suggests that for them this death wasn�۪t cataclysmic just play that got out of hand." Mija finds a way to see really see the world with its flowers rustling trees laughing people and cruelties and in doing so turns reality into art tragedy into the sublime. It�۪s an extraordinary transformation one that emerges through seemingly unconnected narrative fragments tenderly observed moments and a formal rigor that might go unnoticed. Yet everything pieces together in this heartbreaking film ��� motifs and actions in the opening are mirrored in the last scenes ��� including flowers those that bewitch Mija outside the restaurant and those in a vase at the dead girl�۪s house. The river that flows in the opening shot streams through the last image too less a circle than a continuum." seeing the world deeply is at the heart of this quietly devastating humanistic work from the South Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong. Throughout the story the teacher a bespectacled man with an easy manner will guide the students as each struggles to write a single poem searching memories and emotions for inspiration. ���Up till now you haven�۪t seen an apple for real �۝ he says in that first class as the film cuts to a student Mija  (Yun Jung-hee) sliding into a seat. ���To really know what an apple is to be interested in it to understand it �۝ he adds ���that is really seeing it.�۝ From the way the camera settles on Mija it�۪s evident that he could substitute the word apple for woman ��� or life."

He�۪s tickled that he has to go through the usual safety gantlet at the airport: ���It�۪s me �۝ he says to his friend working security who treats him as gravely as any potential terrorist threat. Part of what�۪s satisfying about ���Cedar Rapids �۝ which was directed by Miguel Arteta (���The Good Girl�۝) from a smart generous script by Phil Johnston is that it takes both Tim and his joy seriously and without self-congratulatory winks and nudges. Tim is funny with his Ken-doll hair and sweater vests wide-eyed wonder and fear (���There�۪s an Afro-American man standing in my room �۝ he says with dismay on meeting a suitemate) but he only looks like a punch line." though at different avuncular registers Ronald and Dean help initiate Tim into convention rituals including bleary nights at the bar flirtations and official and unofficial team building.

Though he tries to keep his eyes  on the prize notably a hunk of glass called the Two Diamonds award that he�۪s meant to bring back to Brown Valley Tim sways bends and nearly breaks.

Tim carries a money belt strapped to his stomach as if he were braving the wilds of New York and thinks the hotel clerk who asks for a credit card (for incidentals) might be part of a con. His worries are tempered after settling into his suite where he�۪s soon caught between different oppositional forces: his black suitemate Ronald Wilkes (Isiah Whitlock Jr. deadpan and very fine) a man of reason and Apollonian sobriety; and a third member  of this unlikely party Dean Ziegler a Dionysian figure played with vulgar gusto and at a suitably loud volume by John C. Reilly." slightly) Tim travels a classic path of enlightenment that runs parallel with our own understanding of him. It�۪s a modest journey of a modest man that Mr. Arteta smartly doesn�۪t inflate in a movie that clocks in at a fast 87 minutes. In his characteristic unassuming fashion he gives the actors room to play even as he keeps the mood as intimate as his filmmaking. And while Mr. Arteta likes a dirty joke as much as the next comic director because those laughs burble up from characters whose raucousness comes from an honest grappling with life�۪s absurdities the jokes sing as well as zing." Tim has traveled a great distance psychologically if not geographically to Cedar Rapids Iowa from the fictional town of Brown Valley Wis. An insurance salesman he has been sent to an annual convention to represent the tiny company that serves as the family he doesn�۪t have. Left fatherless as a boy motherless as an adolescent he has looked to his boss Bill (the terrific character actor Stephen Root) for paternal guidance and to his seventh-grade teacher Macy (Sigourney Weaver perfect) for something more than maternal comfort.

Katherine�۪s first meeting with Palmer ��� in which Ms. Aniston or rather her character impersonates a boozy cynical Los Angeles dowager ��� is also one of a handful of lively and successful comic set pieces that keep the movie from lapsing into by-the-numbers hack work.

The sexual politics of ���Cactus Flower�۝ are interestingly awkward looking anxiously back to the �۪50s and flinching at the onset of feminism but this version occasionally lets loose an unacknowledged snarl of regression and resentment.

It makes sense in context or rather it doesn�۪t which is a good thing since Mr. Sandler�۪s movies work best when the sentimentality and self-congratulation are disrupted by anarchic nonsense. And the story derived by the screenwriters Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling from two stage plays by way of I. A. L.

It�۪s prickly and pungent whereas the new version barely rises to the level of a slogan and seems to have been designed to excite search engines rather than flesh-and-blood audiences." reluctant imposture is complicated when Palmer discovers that she has a daughter (Bailee Madison) and a son (Griffin Gluck) whose father Danny must then pretend to be. Mr. Sandler who built a career on childishness often seems more comfortable horsing around with kids (or other maturity-resistant grown men) than getting all lovey-dovey with adult women.

Marcus Aquila and his sidekick a British slave named Esca played by Jamie Bell. The bond between them is formed when Marcus moved by Esca�۪s self-sacrificing courage in the gladiatorial arena persuades the bloodthirsty audience to spare the young man�۪s life. Things are a bit awkward between them since Marcus is the representative of an occupying army that has dispossessed and slaughtered Esca�۪s people. Nonetheless a debt of honor must be upheld and they set off into the Scottish hinterlands beyond Hadrian�۪s Wall where Marcus�۪s father had commanded a legion that vanished along with its eagle. Since then no Roman has ventured into this territory which is populated by savage Seal People." ���The Eagle�۝ imagines the wilds of ancient Britain as a preadolescent treehouse world of loyalty rivalry and adventure. Mr. Macdonald and the screenwriter Jeremy Brock observe the ���no girls allowed�۝ rule with literal-minded rigor. A few women appear briefly on screen mostly to cast flirtatious glances in the direction of the hunky hero played by Channing Tatum but none are given names or a line of intelligible dialogue." the best moments belong to supporting players who toss bits of sharp acting into the blunt and muddy clangor.

Esca does seem to grapple with a sense of divided loyalty since his devotion to Marcus makes him a traitor to his own people but this identity crisis goes no deeper than a few scowls and pouts from Mr. Bell. Though there are some nasty Romans and some tales of Roman nastiness the film is saturated with the romance of empire to an extent that feels more than a little anachronistic." the Seal folk look like punk rockers in contrast to the rebellious tribes down south who call to mind a Jethro Tull reunion tour. What both the marauding southern tribes ��� which besiege the garrison where Marcus is stationed at the beginning of the movie ��� and their northern counterparts evoke of course are the Indians in an old western.

Following a Roman military commander�۪s lonely mission to retrieve the golden bird of the title the movie directed by Kevin Macdonald plays less like a 1950s Technicolor sword-and-sandal epic than like a western of the same era but with foggier visuals and skimpier political and sexual subtext. Lumbering along for a bit less than two hours which passes like three it feels more like a chore than like an adventure." the young French actor Tahar Rahim (���A Prophet�۝) plays the villain with such startling and soulful conviction that you may be tempted to switch sides and root against the square-jawed sad-eyed Roman who is supposed to be the hero."

the independent movie ���Cold Weather�۝ opens with a shot of raindrops clinging to a pane of glass a fitting introduction for a movie about characters who are revealed gradually as if through a glass ��� not darkly but obliquely. With brooding expressive digital photography a rooted sense of place and characters that seem as real as the people next door the director Aaron Katz has created a lived-in world that�۪s so intimate and familiar that even with the story�۪s unexpected turns you might not initially see its art for its everydayness." the case is solved though it�۪s satisfying that Mr. Katz is more interested in exploring the mysteries of other people than in playing around with genre. (He does like to play too as is evident in the joyful goofy almost-no-action climax that comes complete with disguises running engines and slashed car tires.) As in his previous features ���Dance Party USA�۝ and ���Quiet City�۝ (available for rental and highly recommended) ���Cold Weather�۝ concerns young people moving from a preoccupying sense of self to an embracing understanding of another human being. With only the most natural of conversations and an exacting relay of close-ups intimate two shots and meditative landscapes Mr. Katz reveals how the self-knowing individual becomes known to others and me turns into we." Mr. Katz who wrote as well as edited the movie (from a story by him and two of his producers Brendan McFadden and Ben Stambler) approaches his themes in a roundabout fashion. Yet while many of the first scenes don�۪t seem to be overtly advancing any specific idea or even much of the story each adds a subtle new note a bit of texture a thin layer of meaning. Here meaning doesn�۪t come hurtling at you in great expository chunks as it often does in movies but through an accretion of true-to-life details notably in the hesitant gestures offhand exchanges and sidelong glances (Mr. Katz is an adept choreographer of looks not quite met) the sighs and visible longings of people groping toward one another."

Although they have an easy comfortable way with each other they don�۪t seem especially close. A glimmer of tension flashes during a dinner they have early on with their parents when Gail raises and then quickly drops some issue between her and Doug. But because she refuses to get into it quickly moving on with a wave of her hand and a short laugh you never learn what if anything happened which wasn�۪t the point of the scene anyway. What matters is her refusal to engage as well as the searching look Doug gives her." but also turns out to be something of a sly red herring. Embracing the role of detective (at last all that schooling pays off!) Doug leads an investigation with Gail and Carlos eagerly in tow that takes the tale from one secret to another in quiet sometimes off-kilter comic scenes that are often more Abbott and Costello (with a touch of the Hardy boys) than Holmes and Watson. The no-tech nature of the sleuthing (Doug ferrets out one clue by scribbling a pencil on a blank motel notepad revealing the indentations left underneath by another hand) keeps the story in the realm of the plausible even as the minor twists add slow-moving ripples of restrained excitement." directed and edited by Aaron Katz based on a story by Mr. Katz Brendan McFadden and Ben Stambler; director of photography Andrew Reed; music by  Keegan DeWitt; production design by Elliott Glick; produced by Lars  Knudsen Mr. McFadden Mr. Stambler and Jay Van Hoy; released by IFC  Films.

Doug lends Carlos a Sherlock Holmes book and you think nothing of it. But when Rachel after failing to meet Carlos one night seems to disappear the plot suddenly thickens or really just very gently shifts focus." and one of the pleasures of this unassuming yet expansive movie is how it shoulders its weighty human subject so lightly. With no grand speeches or oversized gestures Mr. Katz creates a specific world that gracefully enlarges with universal meaning. It�۪s a world in which a simple coffee table (carried home by Doug in the beginning) becomes the literal centerpiece for newfound friendship as the four characters meet for the first time one night hanging out while Keegan DeWitt�۪s tinkling percussive music keeps them company.

Emilia is angry at her father a judge with two ex-wives and a long history of philandering but her resentment is more a topic of conversation and a pretext for emoting than anything else." but in any case Emilia is an interestingly complicated person. On screen she is less abrasive and less brassily sexual than in print but unlike a lot of movie characters whether they live in comedy or melodrama she is not simple or predictable or conventional.

As a director he is known for sharp surprising comedies of modern sexual manners like ���The Opposite of Sex�۝ and ���Happy Endings�۝ (both featuring Ms. Kudrow) and his work as a screenwriter ranges across genres and styles from indie-ish thrillers like  ���Diabolique�۝ to the sentimental bubble bath of ���Marley and Me�۝ (for which he shared writing credit with Scott Frank).

Everything seems to take much too long and also to happen much too quickly as the novel�۪s leisurely chronology is telescoped into a flurry of life-altering events that seem to happen in the course of a few months.

She addresses her 8-year-old stepson William (Charlie Tahan) with the reflexive sarcasm that insecure people think is a sign of being ���good with kids �۝ and she seems more eager to let herself off the hook than to apologize when something she says or does causes pain." whose developing ambivalent connection to each other is the only relationship in the movie that seems genuinely alive to the possibility of change or surprise. Mr. Tahan who has the sharp quizzical features of a very young Crispin Glover does not do the usual cute precocious movie-kid thing but rather a skeptical mercurial real-kid thing. Ms. Portman gracefully conveys the awkwardness that an adult who is at once rival usurper and substitute parent would bring to encounters with such a child. It makes sense that Emilia and William should be the heart of the film but it is too bad they are the only thing in it that works." Jack (Scott Cohen) is handsome and seems like a nice enough guy in part because his role in the destruction of his first marriage is not examined very thoroughly. And in any case his first wife Carolyn a super-successful obstetrician played by Lisa Kudrow is a cold competitive imperious monster obsessed with status and control. Carolyn is presented in such an extreme way that by the time she shows a glimmer of human feeling you no longer believe such a thing is possible. Ms. Kudrow ordinarily so deft at puncturing her characters�۪ vanity with her own wit does not lift this one out of the realm of spiteful caricature."

As he chooses models and suffers a last-minute loss of his showroom (homelessness is a recurring theme) fashion industry notables  pop up to pontificate and advise." the film�۪s well-intentioned preachiness is unlikely to win over those  who favor Genesis and denial  over climate science. We�۪ve heard it all before if not in the schoolmarmish tones of Glenn Close whose patronizing narration (���The earth is a miracle�۝) makes the film feel almost as long as the life of its subject. Accompanied by a soundtrack heavy on ethnic ululations Ms. Close guides us from the dawn of time to the sunset of fossil-derived energy with soporific sobriety." �۝ David Swajeski�۪s listless profile of the young clothing designer Nary Manivong a passion for fashion elbows aside every other emotion.

Mr. Drenner skips ahead three decades and concludes that the grindhouse spirit is still alive if only as a subject of parody and homage by contemporary directors like Quentin Tarantino."

The clips from unnamed nudist-camp ���documentaries�۝ to classics of the genre like ���Scum of the Earth�۝ and ���Ilsa She Wolf of the SS �۝ are consistently diverting and sometimes surprisingly artful. The commentary from film historians and a large group of middle-aged and older veterans of the business can be obvious and repetitive. But the directors John Landis Herschell Gordon Lewis (���Scum of the Earth�۝) and Don Edmonds (���Ilsa�۝) provide self-deprecating humor and pungent anecdotes." though his filmmaking skills are rudimentary at best.

And in Mr. Pleskun�۪s  relentless efforts to shape his longtime girlfriend Barbara into a combination of showbiz partner and carnival barker ���Strongman�۝ locates the kind of organic hook that all documentaries need but few are blessed with." �۝ Zachary Levy�۪s lump-in-the-throat portrait of an aging muscleman is an outsider tale of unforced rawness and lilting poignancy. Not that Stanley Pleskun a k a Stanless Steel is in any way clapped out: he can hoist 10 000-pound trucks with his legs and  three adults with a single finger. It�۪s the emotional heavy lifting that does him in." Mr. Pleskun runs a scrap-metal business in New Jersey; in the evenings he�۪s an entertainer twisting horseshoes at birthday parties and bending pennies at trade shows. The fame that so far has eluded him stokes the fire in his domelike belly and drives the film�۪s sometimes unbearably intimate narrative."

���The Way Back�۝ was inspired by a 1956 best seller ���The Long Walk �۝ about a Polish Army officer Slavomir Rawicz who claimed to have escaped a Siberian camp and walked 4 000 miles to India. (Evidence now suggests that Mr. Rawicz probably didn�۪t make that journey though other prisoners might have.) Mr. Weir and Mr. Clarke make two crucial mistakes. They tell us right at the start how many travelers survive which as the walkers stumble turns this into something of a gruesome guessing game in the vein of  ���Ten Little Indians.�۝ Second they frame the movie with some information ��� text at the start newsreel footage at the end ��� that strongly suggests that this is a true story." �۝ a heroically minded survival story from Peter Weir tells the possibly true tale of a group of prisoners who fled a Soviet gulag in 1940 and walked wandered and all but crawled to freedom. For months a veritable league of national types united by desperation and the English language push through the cold and the heat slipping through forests and across mountains and deserts. Surviving on moldering provisions and precious scraps of protein dodging predators two-legged and four- the travelers embody a besieged humanity that might have been more stirring if their torment were in a rather less exquisite frame." based on the book ���The Long Walk�۝ by Slavomir Rawicz; director of photography Russell Boyd; edited by Lee Smith; music by Burkhard Dallwitz; production design by John Stoddart; costumes by Wendy Stites; produced by Joni Levin Mr. Weir Duncan Henderson and Nigel Sinclair; released by Newmarket Films and Wrekin Hill Entertainment.

It isn�۪t that watching people walk and walk some more is dull: In ���Gerry�۝ Gus Van Sant made motion hypnotic and Mr. Weir did the same in ���Picnic at Hanging Rock.�۝ It�۪s that Mr. Weir�۪s self-consciously magisterial visuals ��� the swooping aerial and crane shots and harmoniously composed images of tiny figures marching across harsh landscapes ��� tend to lull and even reassure you when you should be shaken to the core. Each time the camera soars over the men you sense the civilizing rational consciousness behind the scenes carefully managing a natural world that as it downs one traveler after another should be terrifying." Jim Sturgess (Janusz) Saoirse Ronan (Irena) Colin Farrell (Valka) Mark Strong (Khabarov) Dragos Bucur (Zoran) Alexandru Potocean (Tomasz) Gustaf Skarsgard (Voss) and Sebastian Urzendowsky (Kazik)." Mr. Smith (Ed Harris terse tense and very Ed Harris) who warns of the dangers of kindness Janusz settles into the prisoner�۪s routine. He harvests wood and digs for coal learns to keep quiet and how to vanquish lice. (Bury your clothing in the snow.) The unspeakable conditions the grime haunted faces violent outbursts and eerie lighting ��� along with the startling contrast between the splendor  of the natural surroundings and the ugliness of the camp ��� makes this place of death come alive a verisimilitude that�۪s almost undone when a heavily tattooed Colin Farrell starts throwing gangster attitude." but rather that of filmmakers who decided to cast a well-known Irish actor as a Russian gangster in an ostensibly true saga.  As Valka a gambler with a knife he calls Wolf Mr. Farrell is watchable and sometimes funny if not especially menacing. The loudness (vocal gestural) of his character and performance means you can�۪t ignore him and all the body grease and hieroglyphics along with the perfectly fine Russki accent only add to the distraction. It takes time before you can simultaneously see Mr. Farrell and believe in his character which isn�۪t true of Mr. Harris and Mr. Sturgess both more contained (or restrained)." Janusz is leading Valka Mr. Smith and four other escapees through the forest the first leg in what will be a punishing race against the elements time hunger and fear. It�۪s a tough journey and not just for them though it certainly has its spectacular attractions. Working with his frequent cinematographer Russell Boyd as well as a crack sound crew Mr. Weir makes the most of his stunning natural set from the spooky snowy woods to the caves where the escapees make camp and nearly starve to death. There on one desperate night the men chase off a small pack of wolves that has  downed some prey and then the travelers fall to their knees to feast feverishly on the carrion themselves." in a short scene that�۪s a preview of the horrors to come with a barking agent accusing a young Polish cavalry officer Janusz (a very fine Jim Sturgess) of criticizing the Communist Party and spying for foreign powers. Cut to Siberia where amid the haunting mountains and indigo light a labor camp officer tells Janusz and hundreds of other accused enemies of the people that (in a somewhat Herzogian as in Werner pronouncement) ���nature is your jailer and she is without mercy.�۝ From all the stunning landscapes Mr. Weir seems to think of her more like a beautiful if harsh mistress an attitude that initially works to his film�۪s advantage only to become an increasing liability." Mr. Weir needlessly burdens his story investing it with an expectation of brute truth that this overly temperate film doesn�۪t want to meet. Certainly if this were framed as fiction it might be easier to buy Mr. Farrell as a Russian gangster or forgive the crudely obvious commercial rationale of his casting. On the other hand there is nothing to be done with the gentle adolescent girl (Saoirse Ronan) who joins the travelers and remains so miraculously unbothered by this band of brothers that she transforms into their patron saint. What happens to her and the rest is of course touching. It�۪s impossible not to cry at their suffering but whether you�۪ll feel anything is another story."

but too many other actors are crowded into too few scenes. Chris Bridges (a k a Ludacris) as the owner of Adam�۪s favorite bar could surely do more and so could Olivia Thirlby as Emma�۪s radiantly monogamous younger sister. Lake Bell as a smitten co-worker of Adam�۪s is funny even as her character is set up from the start to be hurt and humiliated a fate the film tries unconvincingly to soften."

Kevin Kline who played a goatish older literary gent in ���Definitely Maybe �۝ does something similarly mischievous and amusing as Adam�۪s father a louche former sitcom star who takes up with his son�۪s ex-girlfriend (Ophelia Lovibond)." lackluster picture and not stars of the year�۪s greatest girl-bromance? (Or whatever you�۪d call it; that no apt label exists is surely symptomatic.) To imagine Ms. Kaling and Ms. Gerwig in a remake of ���Thelma and Louise�۝ or ���The Wedding Crashers�۝ is to experience an equal measure of frustration and hope. Why can�۪t we have a few movies like that and not quite so many like this?" Ms. Portman�۪s is the one who insists on keeping things casual physical and commitment-free. The arrangement that Adam and Emma agree upon is that they will have as much sex as they want ��� and Mr. Reitman�۪s way with montage suggests  that it�۪s a lot ��� without the emotional entanglements that everyone watching knows are inevitable and that they both want. Emma�۪s resistance seems particularly unmotivated.

Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes." though Adam�۪s best pal Eli (Jake Johnson) is much blander than the crude dude you would expect to find in his position. The film�۪s great squandered opportunity ��� and also the source of some of its best comic moments ��� is that Ms. Gerwig and Mindy Kaling in effect share the role of Emma�۪s zany sidekick." it is rougher and randier than those movies earning its R rating with a lot of naughty talk and a dose of semi-cynical sexual candor. The first scenes flail in the direction of various coarse comic subgenres as we see an icky awkward summer camp encounter followed by a frat-house blowout in which we catch sight of Greta Gerwig drunk and wearing shorts with the word ���whore�۝ emblazoned across the back. Then there is a funeral some family awkwardness and a drunken evening that leads to morning-after sex in the wake of a one-night stand that did not happen. It�۪s not really as confusing as it all sounds but it is hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Reitman shot six or seven movies and then went into the editing room blindfolded to splice them all together." playing Emma a Los Angeles doctor who works emergency room rotations is quite a bit smaller and more emotionally complicated. What are these two doing together? A possible solution to the mystery emerges if you recall a particular scene involving Mila Kunis in ���Black Swan.�۝ Ms. Portman can now claim what appears to be a unique distinction: She may be the only Golden Globe-winning actress to simulate sex on screen with two former members of the cast of ���That �۪70s Show.�۝" �۝ and it also stars Ashton Kutcher a perfectly nice-looking fellow and an old hand at this kind of thing.

An admiring clever remake of Kim Ki-young�۪s legendary film of the same title from 1960 this version directed by Im Sang-soo is at once more explicit than the original and less kinky. Rather than sweep with Bu̱uelian mischief from melodrama to black comedy to surrealist pastiche it hesitates among those possibilities as if unable to calculate the proper ratio of sincerity to camp." based on the film by Kim Ki-young; director of photography Lee Hyung Deok; edited by Lee Eun Soo; production design by Lee Ha Jun; costumes by Choi Se Yeon; produced by Jason Chae; released by IFC Films.

With her wide eyes tiny frame and delicate features she projects both na��ve vulnerability and a reserve of stubborn wily toughness. The innocent maid at the mercy of corrupt masters is an old theme in literature and movies pornographic and otherwise and Mr. Im nods both at the sentimental ���Jane Eyre�۝ side of the tradition and at its more Gothic even Sadean manifestations." in any case is ripe with both and Mr. Im�۪s voluptuous visual palette combined with the dexterity of his cast is enough to hold your interest and at times to make you hold your breath. The opening scene which takes place in a workaday urban world strikes a deceptive note of realism and introduces the main character Eun-yi (Jeon Do-yeon) who quickly leaves behind her job at a noodle shop to go to work for a wealthy family." Hoon (Lee Jung-jae) a powerful business executive and gifted amateur pianist is the only man (apart from a few silent flunkies) in a universe managed though not exactly ruled by women. He is the celestial body around which various female satellites orbit: his young all-seeing scarily articulate daughter; his wife Hae-ra (Seo Woo) pregnant with twins; his socially ambitious mother-in-law (Park Ji-young); and Mrs. Cho (Youn Yuh-jung) the senior servant whose guile bitterness and temperamental instability almost make her rather than Eun-yi the title character." saturated tones that recall the glories of �۪50s Technicolor and create an atmosphere tinged with suspense and heavy with eroticism both implicit and literal. Sex and violence hover constantly in the air even when not much seems to be happening and the psychological center of gravity shifts from one character to another in a way that is both pleasurably disorienting and a bit distancing. We are sometimes plunged with Eun-yi into a world of hidden agendas and covert feelings but at other times we observe its workings through the director�۪s amused objective eye." the comedy of upper-crust manners the feminist fable the erotic romp. That it manages to be each of these in turn testifies to Mr. Im�۪s skill but also turns out to be a limitation since the film is in the end an exercise in thwarted and confused desire." not-quite-appropriate term Hoon seduces Eun-yi and she welcomes his advances even though their predatory nature puts them in the neighborhood of rape." cynical man however dashing he might seem is in love with her? ��� and ruthlessly cunning. Eventually she is exposed to the furious jealousy of the other women each of whom has a reason to be threatened by the eager-to-please new servant and to want her out of the picture." ���The President�۪s Last Bang �۝ based on the final days of President Park Chung-hee of South Korea who was assassinated in 1979 managed to be both a sober procedural and a bloody hilarious farce. ���The Housemaid�۝ saves most of its craziness for the end ��� two final scenes that seem to come out of nowhere even as they make glaringly overt the dramatic extremity and phantasmagorical invention that had previously seemed to lurk just outside the frame."

The vibe is respectful intimate both professional and familial. The women perform for men who leer and at times cheer but keep their hands if not their money to themselves.

It�۪s a measure of the lamentable state of independent distribution in this country that the movie despite receiving some critical support at Cannes never hooked an American buyer which is why it�۪s opening in New York at the Anthology Film Archives as part of a special program.

Beau wants to make it and maybe Kelly too and for about three minutes it�۪s unclear if he�۪s a desperado or a knight in regulation cowboy hat and plaid shirt.

both things are more or less true and Mr. Oliveira�۪s film has the added virtue of feeling entirely original even as it evokes a number of rich literary and cinematic traditions. As a ghost story it owes more to Henry James�۪s psychological curiosity than to Edgar Allan Poe�۪s sensationalism but it is also indebted to the various kinds of realism that flourished in film and in novels in the early and middle decades of the last century. Finally though it exhausts comparison even to other films by this director who has both done everything and is just getting started." inventive and entirely appropriate use of digital special effects.

abstract questions but they could hardly be more serious or more relevant. Here in America after all the pursuit of happiness has the status of a foundational right coincident but not quite identical with material prosperity. In Britain where dourness can seem to be as much a part of the stereotypical national character as bad food foul weather and precise distinctions of status the assertion of a right to be happy can seem almost revolutionary." which brings its own discontents. Its citizens are free to rise and to find their own way but this freedom makes them ultimately responsible for their own satisfaction branding a sad sack like Ken and a wounded bird like Mary with the stigma of failure. They ��� Mary in particular as the film�۪s devastating final shot makes plain ��� are have-nots bereft of the comforts of solidarity and beyond the reach of charity. To quote Paul McCartney another great British artist who is almost exactly Mr. Leigh�۪s age: Where do they all come from? Where do they all belong?" partly because Mr. Leigh pays such close attention to the rhythms of Tom and Gerri�۪s life and to details of their background Tom�۪s in particular. In a late section (the story is told in chapters corresponding to the seasons) a death in the family calls him from London back to his hometown Hull a sojourn that serves as a reminder of how in today�۪s Britain class divisions often persist in the form of regional disparities." the antically joyful heroine of ���Happy-Go-Lucky �۝ was a radically free spirit almost violent in her expressions of good feeling. Tom and Gerri played with uncanny subtlety and tremendous soul by Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen are much more subdued but no less radiant and just as extreme in their delight. Their long comfortable marriage seems to have unfolded without serious friction or disappointment." and ���Another Year�۝ is genuinely happy for them and also eventually for their son Joe (Oliver Maltman) a decent chap who genially endures Mary�۪s increasingly feverish and jealous attention. But sorrow and its implications cannot be banished entirely from this chronicle of their contentment. Ronnie glum and silent as a wood carving represents an older Britain of want and resignation in which people were expected to know their place." and whose professional enthusiasm combines a craftsman�۪s pride in handiwork with a nerd�۪s glee at knowing stuff. Gerri is a therapist who counsels patients at a clinic one of them a lower-middle-class housewife (played by Imelda Staunton the star of Mr. Leigh�۪s ���Vera Drake�۝) whose bottomless despair is the complete reverse  of Gerri�۪s fulfillment." �۝ a new Portuguese feature by Manoel de Oliveira who turned 102 this month." mostly of the respectable middle-class variety." and not only because as a storyteller whose native terrain is modern Britain he can hardly hope to avoid it. And sure enough the observant viewer of his splendidly rich and wise new feature ���Another Year �۝ will notice the shadows that an always-evolving system of social hierarchy casts over the passage of the seasons. (���We�۪re all graduates �۝ one character reminds another with the prickly pride of belonging to the first generation to receive a university education in an era of expanded opportunity.)" �۝ though on a somewhat larger scale ���Another Year�۝ is about the unequal distribution of happiness. Why do some people ��� like Tom and Gerri the post-�۪60s 60-something couple at the center of this episodic story ��� seem to have an inexhaustible even superabundant supply while others seem unable to acquire even the smallest portion? Can happiness be borrowed stolen or inherited? Is it earned by meritorious works or granted by the obscure operations of grace?" Tom and Gerri are patient kind and nonjudgmental offering advice and encouragement and overlooking behavior that might make less generous spirits cringe. But their goodness is so thorough that it may inspire some unkind thoughts. Do they associate with Mary and Ken out of genuine affection or because spending time with such miserable types makes them feel (and look) better? Is their tolerant solicitude a form of complacency? And is ���Another Year�۝ therefore not a loving portrait of the modern liberal temperament but rather a quietly seething indictment of its nose-in-the-air narcissism?" compared with London�۪s sunshine and the existences of Tom�۪s brother Ronnie (David Bradley) and his family are bleak and circumscribed. You understand what Tom managed to escape. You also understand that his smiling embrace of every detail of his life with Gerri ��� the Volvo the garden the holidays in Ireland ��� is a sign not of smugness but rather of gratitude." as in its immediate precursor ���Happy-Go-Lucky �۝ Mr. Leigh is also after a more elusive and troubling form of injustice one that is almost cosmically mysterious even as it penetrates and sometimes threatens to poison the relationships that make up everyday life." her co-worker and longtime friend played by Lesley Manville with the kind of wrenching borderline-unbearable lack of self-protective actorly vanity that reminds you that however gentle it may seem this is still a Mike Leigh film. In other words the spectacle of humiliation that takes place when uncomfortable self-consciousness turns into its opposite is never far away.

another knits together. Ms. Williams and Mr. Gosling so puffy and tired at first glance reappear in the blink of an eye as younger trimmer and more energetic versions of themselves. Six years have been rolled back ��� the actors had barely a month to accomplish their startling physical transformations ��� and Dean working for a Brooklyn moving company is courting Cindy whom he first encounters at the assisted-living residence where she visits her beloved grandmother. She has a jerk for a boyfriend (Mike Vogel) another one for a father (John Doman) and a steadfast determination to finish college and go on to medical school." Michelle Williams (Cindy) Faith Wladyka (Frankie) Mike Vogel (Bobby) and John Doman (Jerry)." as ever heartbreakingly precise in every scene but if Mr. Gosling�۪s character is burdened with too little story hers is saddled with too much. Mr. Cianfrance is capable of drawing nuances of feeling from his actors but he does not trust the story enough to let it move according to any internal emotional logic. Instead a lot of pretty obvious and not always convincing stuff needs to happen. Cindy�۪s boyfriend and father need to be made into caricatures of male insensitivity and narrative bombs need to be carefully lighted and detonated as if ordinary love were not explosive enough." this still-young couple is at the start of another day of weary struggle. Dean is a house painter Cindy is a nurse and they share their modest house in Pennsylvania with their 6-year-old daughter Frankie (Faith Wladyka) and a dog whose disappearance is a harbinger of things to come." but most movies pick a side and stay on it. ���Blue Valentine �۝ a long-gestating project directed by Derek Cianfrance examines a young couple falling in and out of love and makes of that thin line a vast and blurry no man�۪s land. Speaking of music Leonard Cohen has a song about being danced to the end of love but Mr. Cianfrance�۪s characters Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) stumble and crawl in that direction having forgotten the nimble playful steps they once knew." while she works herself to exhaustion and rarely smiles. The sexual spark that he tries to recapture with a night away at a cheesy ���fantasy�۝ resort motel has turned soggy. What went wrong?" Dean�۪s willingness to do anything for Cindy strikes her and us as charming and brave. He will play the ukulele on a dark street endure a dinner-table third degree and a savage beating save what money he can and commit to a future of accidental but nonetheless devoted fatherhood. But the very qualities that seemed so appealing to Cindy at first are nearly intolerable six years later. She wants him to do something with his life to show some drive or initiative but all he wants is to be with her and Frankie. He once looked like the nicest guy she had ever met and now he seems like the weakest." Mr. Cianfrance supplies both too much information and too little. Mr. Gosling is convincing as the run-down desperate older Dean and maybe a bit less so as the younger version but in any case it is hard to intuit what connects one to the other. The drinking and the violent temper he displays in one overwrought climactic scene seem to come from nowhere to be willed into being by the director�۪s narrative conceit rather than arising organically from the character�۪s life." for all their sustained agony and flickering joy something less than completely realized human beings. Mr. Cianfrance�۪s ingenious chronological gimmick coupled with his anxious clumsy plotting leaves them without enough oxygen to burst into breathing loving life. A recent German film called ���Everyone Else �۝ directed by Maren Ade (and released in the United States this year) shows with minimal embellishment and absolute honesty how potentially fatal fissures begin to develop within a young couple�۪s relationship. ���Blue Valentine�۝ mystifies the emotional logic that Ms. Ade presents with bracing clarity and leaves its audience along with poor Cindy and Dean in a muddle of hurt feelings and vague disappointments." who wrote the screenplay with Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne begins close to the bitter finale of Cindy and Dean�۪s relationship skips back to the winsome beginning and toggles back and forth between those points leaving the middle to the audience�۪s imagination." admittedly uncharitable angle ���Blue Valentine�۝ looks like a grim dirty-realist festival-circuit version of (and sequel to) ���Knocked Up.�۝ Like ���Biutiful �۝ another unsparingly harsh movie that opens on Wednesday it has a naturalism that is almost entirely a matter of visual texture and social milieu. The grainy washed-out colors of the breakup phase which contrast with the somewhat brighter palette of the courtship sections create an illusion of immediacy and rawness that is underlined by the scruffy Keystone State locations. And Ms. Williams and Mr. Gosling are exemplars of New Method sincerity able to be fully and achingly present every moment on screen together."

as is his custom Mr. Gonz��lez I̱��rritu creates a feeling of raw sprawling intimacy. The coarse-grained lyrical naturalism of his shooting style can seem more tactile than visual and every shot is full of emotional and social detail bringing Barcelona to itchy sweaty life. And the faces of its inhabitants (including Mr. Bardem with lank hair and a heavy brow) are more picturesque than pretty and their bodies look exposed and raw even when they are fully clothed." working with the cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto a frequent collaborator but without Guillermo Arriaga his screenwriting partner on ���Babel �۝ ���21 Grams�۝ and ���Amores Perros �۝ demonstrates familiar strengths and weakness. Unlike his previous films this one which he wrote with Armando Bo and Nicol��s Giacobone tells a single relatively linear story without hectic cross-cutting and chronological displacement." but many of their younger screen counterparts these days will settle for nothing less than Jesus. Not literally: the part of the actual New Testament Jesus tends to be a limited role best suited to actors of limited range like Jim Caviezel (���The Passion of the Christ�۝) or Jeffrey Hunter (���King of Kings�۝). But there is something irresistible about modern men of sorrows who sacrifice themselves for the sins of others and certain movie stars ��� Kevin Costner and Will Smith most strikingly ��� have not hesitated to exercise the Messiah Clause in their contracts." Maricel ́lvarez (Marambra) Eduard Fern��ndez (Tito) Diaryatou Daff (Ig̩) Cheng Tai Shen (Hai) and Luo Jin (Liwei)." sometimes amazing craft and his resolutely banal ideas ��� may ultimately be a problem of audience and genre. ���Biutiful �۝ like ���Babel �۝ looks more daring and more difficult than it is. But if Mr. Gonz��lez I̱��rritu were let�۪s say to adapt a novel by Nicholas Sparks whose views on love and morality are not ultimately all that different from his the result might be a satisfying and surprising synthesis of styles: a feel-bad art film with an uplifting message for everyone. ���Biutiful �۝ come to think of it is almost that but not entirely in a good way." Armando Bo and Nicol��s Giacobone based on a story by Mr. Gonz��lez I̱��rritu; director of photography Rodrigo Prieto; edited by Stephen Mirrione; music by Gustavo Santaolalla; production design by Brigitte Broch; produced by Mr. Gonz��lez I̱��rritu Jon Kilik and Fernando Bovaira; released by Roadside Attractions.

He checks in on Chinese sweatshop workers and African vendors of counterfeit watches and bags collecting and dispensing money and running interference with police officers and factory owners." Robert Bresson or the Dardenne brothers. Instead he traffics in a vague theology of uplift wherein the road to an entirely abstract heaven is paved with noble instincts." sex violence and drug use." Mr. Gonz��lez I̱��rritu�۪s fine and subtle instincts as a director of actors and a composer of shots are undermined by a melodramatic sense of story and a fundamentally sentimental conception of fate. ���Biutiful�۝ certainly looks real and it rubs your face in all kinds of harsh facts of life from mental illness to poverty to the fatal effects of cheap space heaters operating in poorly ventilated rooms. But this extreme misery is tethered to an idea of redemption that is disconcertingly soft." �۝ Javier Bardem joins their company bringing admirable passion  to a gritty story that amounts to a lower-depths urban version of the Passion. Mr. Bardem best known to American audiences for his chillingly persuasive embodiment of evil in ���No Country for Old Men �۝ combines muscular charismatic physicality with an almost delicate sensitivity and this blend of the rough and the tender gives ���Biutiful�۝ a measure of emotional credibility that it may not entirely deserve." Uxbal is also juggling two young children a mentally unstable former wife (Maricel ́lvarez) and a terminal illness. Every day he is faced with choices that test both his resolve and his decency as he tries to be stoical tough and compassionate ��� a good father a canny hustler and a patient lover in situations that make every role nearly impossible."

The two shyly hit it off despite their different languages communicating with gestures and few words. The illusionist murmurs an occasional ���non �۝ while Alice speaks in sporadic bleats a minimalism that recalls how Tati used fragments of dialogue more for their noise than for their meaning. To watch ��� and listen ��� to his films and ���The Illusionist�۝ is to be reminded of how much useless jabbering there is in movies. (The illusionist�۪s few words are voiced by Jean-Claude Donda while Alice�۪s are supplied by Eilidh Rankin.)" Alice isn�۪t the little girl her wardrobe initially suggests. And when they move in together the illusionist quickly assures her (or the audience) that she can have the bedroom while he takes the sofa. As her taste in pretty things grows and her Mary Janes are replaced by heels the two are pulled in separate directions partly because he has to work harder to support her tastes. This separation allows Mr. Chomet to dodge any Lolita-like complications yet it also means that the bond remains more vaporously sentimental than deeply felt.

Mr. Chomet�۪s muted palette is beautiful and his love for the 1961 Disney classic ���101 Dalmatians�۝ is evident in his gently exaggerated character designs (the father in ���Dalmatians�۝ and the illusionist have noble honkers) though he fills in his backgrounds forgoing the strong sketchlike lines that help give ���Dalmatians�۝ its modernist look." after I saw ���The Illusionist�۝ I learned that it has been sharply criticized by Tati�۪s grandson Richard Tatischeff Schiel McDonald who claims  that the story was inspired by Tati�۪s guilt over abandoning his daughter Helga Marie-Jeanne Mr. McDonald�۪s mother. His complaints have been circulated in the British news media and in May Roger Ebert posted a long letter in which Mr. McDonald calls ���The Illusionist�۝ a ���grotesque eclectic nostalgic homage to its author.�۝ His pain is palpable. But to see ���The Illusionist�۝ exclusively as a Jacques Tati film ��� to read it only through his biography or as regrettably to see it hoping for a new Tati ��� is to disregard the actual extant film. Mr. Chomet as evident from ���The Triplets of Belleville �۝ is not Tati (no one else is) but rather his own artist." who died in 1982 ���The Illusionist�۝ is both a modest homage to its writer and a melancholy look at a lost world. Tati was a music-hall mime before turning to film directing and it is the dusty stage world of magic and dancing girls that this film recalls with a delicate visual style tender humor and a sense of loss. Set in the late 1950s the story opens on an unnamed French magician who is struggling to keep audiences interested in his old-fashioned sleights of hand. The bouquet tucked up his sleeve has become a gift that nobody seems to want." and a near suicide." a story nevertheless emerges clearly if not loudly in the relationship that develops between the two characters. The illusionist has come to the dramatically moodily hued island village at the invitation of an enthusiastic admirer a Scot with a deep thirst and a flirty kilt.  One day the illusionist notices Alice�۪s shabby shoes (she works in the pub swabbing floors and washing clothes) and buys her a pair of bright red Mary Janes. This kindness leads to a friendship that only deepens after she follows him off the island and all the way to Edinburgh where they move into a boardinghouse  that�۪s literally jumping with acrobats and reverberant with the loud miseries of a suicidal clown."

After doing so she sends Yarnell home and gets down to business first by settling her father�۪s accounts. She then hires Rooster because she hears that he has ���true grit �۝ a quality that mostly seems to entail a disregard for preserving the lives of his prisoners. It�۪s no wonder she watches the hanging with such avidity and no wonder too that she takes off after Chaney armed with Rooster and her father�۪s heavy gun." severed fingers and a bad bad man (Barry Pepper spewing fear and spittle). On occasion a Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who calls himself LaBeef joins in the search. Wearing jangling spurs and a luxurious mustache that sits on his lip like a spoiled Persian cat LaBoeuf hopes to bag Chaney for a large reward. Dead or alive everyone in this story ��� snaggletooth thief or boardinghouse owner ��� has a price either on his head or in mind usually in the form of the dollars and cents one person hopes to extract from another. ���Why do you think I am paying you �۝ Mattie asks Rooster ���if not to have my way?�۝" in the midst of a pop-cultural cycle that partly fueled by the Vietnam war was revisiting the cowboy myth with degrees of cynicism and nostalgia. ���True Grit�۝ sticks to the western template but with characters who at least initially fall far short of the heroic ideal of the type that Wayne himself embodied for decades. Yet no matter how roguish (and laughable) in the novel Rooster can�۪t help registering as a larger-than-life hero on screen because the legend who played him by then a survivor of cancer and countercultural assaults (for the jingoistic ���Green Berets�۝) had played his role for so long. When Wayne won best actor for ���True Grit �۝ it was for playing John Wayne." perhaps because its worldview suits their ironic purposes. The whiskey-soaked Rooster still likes to ���pull a cork �۝ as he does in the book and the Coens and Mr. Bridges get into the boozy spirit of things with slurs and pratfalls." a richly conceived and written eccentric as memorable on the page as she is now on screen. Softened for the first film (in which she was played by a  21-year-old Kim Darby in a bob) she has been toughed up again by the Coens so that she resembles the seemingly humorless if often unintentionally humorous Scripture-quoting martinet of Mr. Portis�۪s imagination. At times she brings to mind D. H. Lawrence�۪s famed formulation that ���the essential American soul is hard isolate stoic and a killer.�۝ At other times as when she wears her dead father�۪s oversize coat and hat she looks like a foolish child left to perilous play." a week after ���The Wild Bunch �۝ the Sam Peckinpah western that�۪s widely seen as a metaphor about interventionist follies like Vietnam and that remains an enduring evisceration of the genre. The Coens who like to play with genre often with giggles and winks haven�۪t mounted an assault on the western. But in Mattie they have created a character whose single-minded pursuit of vengeance has unmistakable resonance. In the first ���True Grit �۝  when Rooster watches Mattie cross a river on horseback he jocularly says ���She reminds me of me.�۝ The line isn�۪t in the remake but from the long hard look Rooster gives her now it�۪s clear that she still does for better and worse." ���A Serious Man �۝ about a 1960s Minneapolis professor  who endures trials worthy of Job with an enigmatic short story about  a 19th-century tale involving a possible dybbuk. That story is prefaced with a quotation attributed to the medieval Jewish scholar Rashi (���Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you�۝) that appears in a 19th-century comic story ���The Gilgul or The Wandering Soul �۝ about a dybbuk or restless spirit that inhabits a person. In ���True Grit�۝ the Coens switch to Solomon opening the film with the first half of Proverbs 28:1  (���The wicked flee when none pursueth�۝) a line Mattie quotes early in the novel. Like Mr. Portis they notably omit the second line: ���But the righteous are bold as a lion.�۝" Rooster enters on his best behavior seated in a courtroom amid a fog of cigar smoke and conspicuous lies. The pale ghostly light comes courtesy of the Coens�۪ frequent cinematographer Roger Deakins while many of the twisty funny sentences have been plucked by the filmmakers right from the novel. A deputy United States marshal Rooster has attracted the interest of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld in a terrific film debut) a half-pint who with her bloodlust and severely braided hair is an authentic American Gothic. As she listens to Rooster recount his bloody deeds and high body count her eyes shine with a true believer�۪s excitement." the movie opens and closes with Mattie�۪s voice-over which shifts the story away from Rooster and back to her. The Coens also restore the novel�۪s framing device: ���True Grit�۝ isn�۪t just the story of a gutsy 14-year-old; it is her story as called from the memory of the woman (Elizabeth Marvel) she became." �۝ a comic-serious tale about some nasty brutish times. Beautifully adapted by Joel and Ethan Coen from the parodic western novel by Charles Portis it turns on a 14-year-old Arkansas girl who hires a ���one-eyed fat man�۝ to hunt down her father�۪s killer. First published in 1968 Mr. Portis�۪s tall tale was brought to the screen the next year custom-fitted for John Wayne who rode the role of that fat man Rooster Cogburn straight to an Oscar. Now it�۪s the thinner scene-stealer Jeff Bridges who sits and sometimes drunkenly slumps in the saddle." the brothers punctuate the image of Mattie riding to dry ground with a cutaway to a slack-jawed Rooster his mouth agape in wonder. By the time the scene ends the mood has switched again and Rooster has drawn his gun on LaBoeuf in deadly seriousness. (Mr. Damon plays the designated clown with grace as Mr. Bridges slides between buffoonery and malice.)" Matt Damon (LaBoeuf) Josh Brolin (Tom Chaney) Barry Pepper (Lucky Ned Pepper) Hailee Steinfeld (Mattie Ross) Bruce Green (Harold Parmalee) Roy Lee Jones (Yarnell) and Elizabeth Marvel (adult Mattie)." based on the novel by Charles Portis; director of photography Roger Deakins; edited by Roderick Jaynes; music by Carter Burwell; production design by Jess Gonchor; costumes by Mary Zophres; produced by Joel Coen Ethan Coen and Scott Rudin; released by Paramount Pictures.

If you pay close attention ���Somewhere�۝ will show you everything." but that nonetheless has the power to refresh your perceptions and deepen your sympathies. As it proceeds from one careful watchful slow shot to the next a sad and affecting story emerges about a father�۪s loneliness and a daughter�۪s devotion. But the experience of watching ���Somewhere �۝ shot in lovely tones of Southern California haze by the great Harris Savides is like reading a poem. The scenes play off one another like stanzas producing patterns and echoes that feel like the camera�۪s accidental discoveries even as they are the surest evidence of Ms. Coppola�۪s formidable and subtle art." drugs the usual." �۝ Sofia Coppola�۪s exquisite melancholy and formally audacious fourth feature prepares you for what is to follow in a characteristically oblique and subtle manner. A black Ferrari circulates on an otherwise empty desert speedway driving in and out of the stationary camera�۪s range as the noise of its engine oscillates between a distant whine and a full-throated roar." after breaking his arm in a drunken stumble (���I do all my own stunts�۝ is his facetious deadpan explanation) he is entertained in his room by twin blond pole dancers who work their way through a routine that seems more calisthenic than erotic as he dozes off. (Later he will fall asleep during foreplay his head between the legs of a recent conquest which is to say a woman with whom he had just made eye contact.)" and also without giving him more spiritual depth than would be credible. He lives in a world where his desires are so instantly and easily gratified that they hardly even count as desires since no longing or effort ever enters into the picture." a movie star played right at the boundary between restraint and catatonia by Stephen Dorff. Johnny is living at the Chateau Marmont a storied Hollywood hotel that is either a paradise of easy wish-fulfillment or a purgatory of celebrity anomie. Or maybe both. He seems to be finishing work on one movie while publicizing another ��� from time to time he is whisked from the Chateau to a junket or a special-effects prosthetic-making session ��� but mostly Johnny hangs out smokes cigarettes drinks and has sex with one of the women who seem to be at the hotel for just that purpose." in part a prisoner of his own fantasies and aspirations and he drifts through his days in a state of dazed weirdly polite bafflement. The only thing keeping him from utter ruin is his professionalism which expresses itself in an ingrained habit of courtesy. His job is a paradox: he must be himself by conforming to what everyone else wants him to be and so he must answer dumb questions at a news conference listen patiently to a young aspiring actor�۪s plea for advice and travel to Italy for a ridiculous awards show." Mr. Dorff makes it clear that Johnny is human. It turns out that he has an 11-year-old daughter who at first comes for a brief visit and then because of an unspecified crisis in her mother�۪s life for a longer stay. Her name is Cleo and she is played by Elle Fanning with heartbreaking clarity and grace. Cleo having grown up on this strange planet of fame has learned both how to take advantage of its entitlements and how to acquire some of the life skills that her father has allowed to atrophy. She calls up room service to order ingredients for a homemade dinner and later serves her father and his brother a meal of eggs Benedict." �۝ ���Somewhere�۝ is a study in gilded loneliness. And much in the way that ���Lost �۝ set in Japan showed a debt to recent Asian cinema so ���Somewhere �۝ which takes a voyage to Italy betrays an engagement with the films of Michelangelo Antonioni." and the most remarkable thing about it may be how much it implies while saying so little. There is barely any quotable or memorable dialogue and yet its images are so eloquent that they demand to be seen over and over again." Cleo mothers Johnny but she also watches him with the nervous open adoration of a child. Watchfulness is her defining trait and Ms. Fanning can do more with her eyes than performers many times her age. She conveys jealousy concern curiosity and need and above all the wisdom and half-intact innocence of a person who has witnessed too much adult misbehavior partly by dint of having a father who has never quite grown up." a life Ms. Coppola who comes from a tribe of filmmakers composers and actors surely knows firsthand. But to overemphasize the autobiographical dimensions of ���Somewhere�۝ would be to stop short of identifying its extraordinary insight and originality. There is after all no shortage of movies about celebrity dissolution and in the age of ���Entourage�۝ and TMZ we probably don�۪t even need feature films to bring us the old news that movie stars are pampered narcissistic and promiscuous. That�۪s part of the job description after all. But Ms. Coppola illuminates the bubble of fame and privilege from the inside and maps its emotional and existential contours with unnerving precision and disarming sensitivity."

But when the second movie brought in Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman to play Greg�۪s parents any residual anxiety about the characters�۪ nominal cultural differences gave way to the spectacle of two legends playfully batting around the Jewish stereotypes that the stars themselves struggled against and transcended." because first Jessica Alba has to show up and throw off her clothes and then her body at Mr. Stiller a story line that has everything to do with his star muscle and nothing to do with Greg. This leads to some matrimonial static that draws the series closer to the kind of deadly dull domestic comedy that the ���Fockers�۝ franchise previously managed to avoid becoming." though it also seems clear that Mr. Stiller who in the 10 years since the first ���Fockers�۝ has become a Hollywood powerhouse isn�۪t interested in being the butt of anyone�۪s joke.

Yet perhaps because Mr. Brooks doesn�۪t want to get too heavy even when the story lists toward the weighty much of the dialogue comes in tiny epigrammatic bites not much bigger and certainly no deeper than the affirmations that Lisa has scribbled on Post-its and stuck on her bathroom mirror." Mr. Brooks has more predictable taste in men than his female characters do. Albert Brooks�۪s flop-sweating reporter might have been perfect for Holly Hunter�۪s motor-mouthed television producer in the filmmaker�۪s most successful comedy ���Broadcast News �۝ but it was William Hurt�۪s dry-look anchor who (temporarily) got the girl. Once again Mr. Brooks (the filmmaker) tips the scales mostly because he seems to have mistaken the appealing featherweight Mr. Rudd for a romantic lead. Mr. Wilson might not have the seriousness (or self-seriousness) of a William Hurt but he holds your interest with his idiosyncratic off-rhythm charm and delivery. He�۪s a live wire and when he�۪s onscreen the movie jumps."

The conquered island with its resentful disinherited native occupant Caliban has made it seem especially in recent decades like a fable of European colonialism. At the same time Shakespeare�۪s blend of romance comedy and political intrigue  and his echoings of Virgil and Ovid can make this like his other late work feel at once classical and incipiently postmodern." at some moments like a �۪70s-era laser-rock planetarium show.

Switching the gender of Prospero ��� an aging wizard who is also his author�۪s last and fondest alter ego ��� is more than a gimmick. When the character is a woman a central relationship in the play between the magician and her doted-on child Miranda sheds some of its traditional patriarchal dynamic.

Ms. Taymor�۪s overscaled sense of stage spectacle can be impressive and effective even moving but her three-dimensional high-volume compositions translate awkwardly into the cosmos of cinema which turns her pageantry into mummery and the physical exuberance she likes to draw from performers into mugging." the puckish spirit played by a mostly naked digitally de-sexed Ben Whishaw turns fishy and froggy and feathery thanks to consumer-grade computer-generated special effects. Less magical creatures scramble across dunes and through forests (the film was shot in Hawaii and on New York soundstages) as the camera prowls nervously around them pausing now and then to let them talk." �۝ directed (and also according to the credits written) by Julie Taymor. In this noisy stormy adaptation an energetic and for the most part excellent cast marshals considerable resources of wit discipline and timing in a struggle against the hectic inventiveness that is characteristically for Ms. Taymor either the vehicle for interesting theatrical ideas or a sign of their absence." but rather than cohere into a compellingly new ��� or satisfyingly traditional ��� rendering of the play they slosh around generating glimmers of insight slivers of feeling and spasms of sensation as well as empty dazzle and frustration." regal and vulnerable emphasizes the character�۪s sometimes cruel dignity her need for affection and also her stubborn loneliness. As Miranda Felicity Jones is both the sweet unworldly apple of Prospera�۪s eye and a younger softer version of her ardent intelligent mother.

It opens with the artistic director of a fictional New York ballet company Thomas (Vincent Cassel) announcing that the new season will begin with a ���visceral and real�۝ version of that old favorite. To that end he dumps his prima ballerina Beth  (Winona Ryder) and picks Nina to dance the dual role of the swan queen (an enchanted woman in bird form) and her villainous black twin. But as the pressure builds things fall apart or Nina does. She stumbles out of a spin and begins scratching at her skin. One day she strips a piece from her finger as lightly as if she were peeling a banana." ���Black Swan�۝ looks like a tony art-house entertainment. (Hey there�۪s Lincoln Center!) But what gives it a jolt is its giddy sometimes sleazy exploitation-cinema savvy. The director Darren Aronofsky is a well-schooled cin̩aste and in ���Black Swan�۝ he riffs on Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger�۪s ballet masterpiece ���The Red Shoes �۝ and the pair�۪s ���Black Narcissus �۝ among other influences. But it�۪s also likely that Mr. Aronofsky who was born in 1969 and grew up in Brooklyn frequented Times Square when it was known as the deuce and lined with movie palaces playing the best and worst in trash cinema. I bet he also caught a few episodes of the ���Red Shoe Diaries�۝ on cable." ���Black Swan�۝ tells the story of a ballerina who aches with battered feet and an increasingly crowded head to break out of the corps.

Together they create the solid foundation of truth that makes the slow-creeping hallucinatory flights of fantasy all the more jolting and powerful. Much like the new version of ���Swan Lake�۝ that Thomas creates ���Black Swan�۝ is visceral and real even while it�۪s one delirious phantasmagoric freakout." including bodies in pain and his ever more refined technique. Here working with his usual cinematographer Matthew Libatique and largely shooting hand-held in both super-16-millimeter film and digital Mr. Aronofsky opts for grit over gloss an ideal strategy for a story with a harsh underbelly. Hand-held cinematography can be lazy shorthand for ���reality�۝ (as if life happens in shaky-cam) but here the hand-held visuals work because of their intimacy. The influence of the Belgian filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne can be seen in the close tag-along shots of Nina�۪s head as she hurries off a point of view that brings you within breathing at times panting distance of a character whose behavior can be off-putting." and you see that Mr. Aronofsky is simultaneously telling that story straight playing with the suffering-artist stereotype and having his nasty way with Nina burdening her with trippy psychodrama and letting her run wild in a sexcapade  that will soon be in heavy rotation on the Web. The screenplay by  Mark Heyman Andr̩s Heinz and John McLaughlin invites pop-psychological interpretations about women who self-mutilate while striving for their perfect selves a description that seems to fit Nina.

The story unwinds gracefully and with slow-building emotion in a tiny seaside village in remotest Peru where save for a few modern conveniences people live much as they probably did decades earlier pulling fish from the sea and bound by communal interdependence.  There a young fisherman Miguel (Cristian Mercado) awaits the birth of his first child an event that fills him with so much happiness that he shares his bliss generously with his beloved wife and his more adored male lover."

In the village they play near strangers passing each other with scarcely a look.

By the time he abdicates in 1936 publicly pledging himself to Mrs. Simpson (���the woman I love�۝) turning the throne over to King George VI Edward has a hold on your affections. Those would surely lessen if the film tagged after him when he and Mrs. Simpson subsequently took their post-abdication tour around Germany where they had tea with Hitler and the Duke returned the F�_hrer�۪s Nazi salute.  Like many entertainments of this pop-historical type ���The King�۪s Speech�۝ wears history lightly no matter how heavy the crown." instances when Bertie the closed book tentatively opens and Logue�۪s arrogance gets away from him but both are too decent too banal and the film too ingratiating to resonate deeply. Albert�۪s impediment certainly pales in comparison with the drama surrounding his older popular brother David later King Edward VIII (a fantastic Guy Pearce) and his married American divorc̩e Mrs. Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). After King George V dies David assumes the crown and continues to carry on with Mrs. Simpson a liaison that because of its suggestively perverse power dynamics ��� at a party she orders the new king (yoo-hooing ���David�۝) to fetch her booze ��� hints at a more interesting movie than the one before you."

Hewing to a corporate tradition that is also like it or not ��� and even if you say you don�۪t you really do! ��� a glorious touchstone of American popular culture this film directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard from a script by Dan Fogelman is a lavish romantic musical fairy tale.

Tompkins (Shorty) Ron Perlman (Stabbington Brother) and Richard Kiel (Vladimir)." and the cute and grotesque secondary characters provide bits of comic diversion but frankly you could get chases and gags of this kind from the animation division of just about any major studio these days. The heart of Disney animation lies in song and spectacle and while none of the musical compositions here are quite at the level of ���The Little Mermaid�۝ or ���Beauty and the Beast �۝ they are good enough and made even better by the range and clarity of Ms. Moore�۪s voice." curious and lively and as she approaches her 18th birthday she sets off on the usual heroic voyage of self-discovery accompanied by Flynn and pursued by her mother Flynn�۪s former partners in crime (he is a thief as well as a charmer) and a tireless police horse whose puffing prancing and mugging represent the perfect marriage of Pixarian technical bravura and Disneyesque expressive cartooning." Flynn shuts up before too long allowing the story to find its proper center of gravity which belongs to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) an exiled princess shut up in a tower with only her magic hair and her pet lizard for consolation. Also living there is her mother or at any rate the evil sorceress called Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) who snatched the girl from her real parents and has raised her in cruel passive-aggressive physical and psychological captivity." but sometimes also rough and scary." ���Tangled�۝ had a few different titles. As far as I know none of them were ���Rapunzel: Based on the Novel ���Push�۪ by Sapphire �۝ but the film�۪s portrait of maternal monstrosity may remind you of ���Precious �۝ albeit without the incest the poverty or the violence. (A weaponized frying pan does come into play but not as an instrument of domestic abuse.)" �۝ in three dimensions or two is like entering a familiar old neighborhood that has been tastefully and thoroughly renovated. Not gentrified exactly and certainly not razed but modernized." there are sequences that have some of the ravishing beauty and exquisite detail of the great old hand-drawn Disney features including a few that make gorgeous use of 3-D technology. A scene of paper lanterns descending through mist onto water is especially breathtaking partly because it departs from the usual 3-D insistence on deep focus and sharply defined images creating an experience that is almost tactile in its dreamy softness. Like much of ���Tangled �۝ this moment gives a new look to some very familiar magic." its tower garlanded with clouds ��� is more or less as you remember it and among the inhabitants is the usual crew of princesses emotive beasts (a horse and a chameleon) villains and buffoons. The ambient noises (music by Alan Menken) take you back to a charmed world of swoony longing and sprightly mischief. But the d̩cor is shinier the pace a little faster the overall atmosphere slick and efficient with a few welcome grace notes of self-conscious classicism." though none quite match Mother Gothel for sheer sadistic intensity. A classic underminer she has brainwashed Rapunzel into loving her and her brutal selfishness is camouflaged in sweet-voiced expressions of solicitude. Really though she keeps the girl around only because of that golden hair which has the power to heal wounds cure sickness and most important for Mother Gothel�۪s purposes reverse the aging process." like far too many animated features these days with some annoyingly smart-alecky voice-over narration courtesy of a charming rascal named Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). This temporary hijacking of a princess�۪s tale by her square-jawed love interest seems like a crude commercial calculation a sign to the anxious boys in the audience that things aren�۪t going to be too girly or to Disneyphobes that the studio can bring some DreamWorks-style attitude. (It may also be further evidence of the Pixar touch since the guys in that super-cool animation club are notably reluctant to place female characters at the center of the action.)"

In the busy placid present Ludek (Milan Mikulcik) is cheating on his wife Lucie (Lenka Vlasakova) who is undergoing tests and then treatment for what turns out to be a rare but nonfatal disease. Ludek informs her of his affair (with Radka a younger co-worker played by Petra Hrebickova) with a grating mixture of insensitivity and concern his cowardice and selfishness marking him as a thoroughly ordinary modern man." moving film is that the motives and actions that  define human ethics are never simple and that the Communist regime was especially adept at exploiting this complexity for its own ends. Ludek and his colleagues unearth a secret-police file that tarnishes Pavel�۪s luster showing that many years earlier he had collaborated with the authorities in the persecution of Borek (Antonin Kratochvil) a freethinking sculptor who was Jana�۪s lover at the time. Borek was forced into exile in Sweden where Lucie along with her teenage daughter Bara (Anna Simonova) visits him midway through the movie.

Ludek part of a film crew working on a documentary about Pavel is clearly resentful of the older man�۪s status as a hero to both his nation and his family. His wife Jana (Daniela Kolarova) and daughter adore him and Ludek even if he were a better man would no doubt suffer in comparison." whose other films include ���Up and Down�۝ and ���Divided We Fall �۝ wisely avoids flashbacks ���  a choice that emphasizes the unknowability of the past and also somewhat paradoxically its immediacy. When Jana and Pavel are drawn back into the bad old days aided by the reminiscences of an interrogator (Ladislav Chudik) who shows no sign of remorse all of the old anguish and uncertainty emerges and they struggle to convince themselves that they did the right thing. They and Borek whose flaws are part of their integrity continue to suffer and worry while their onetime oppressor whose cynical view of human nature affords him a clarity they lack seems not to have lost much sleep since the fall of the old regime." and the humane melancholy tone of ���Kawasaki�۪s Rose�۝ is in keeping with the Czech experience of totalitarianism and its aftermath. It is a calm movie but not a tidy one ��� lucid and ethically precise but never simple." Lucie fades into the background while her husband all but disappears. This is understandable ��� who would want to spend any more time with him after all? ��� but also represents something of a missed opportunity. It is perfectly honorable to dwell on the damaged nobility of a tragic figure like Pavel with his sorrowful mien and gentle voice than to wallow in the small vindictive soul of his son-in-law. But the history of Eastern Europe was lived and to some extent written by the mean and the small and if ���Kawasaki�۪s Rose�۝ were say a Romanian film Ludek would most likely be its central figure delighting in the opportunity to stomp the clay feet of an officially designated idol."

Yet this form works because Maria initially appears as unmoored by what is happening as you are.

Though pale as milk Maria contemptuously refers to ���dirty whites �۝ and her son now perhaps in his early 20s was born in Africa. Yet while he is a native son the country ���doesn�۪t like him �۝ as an African man tells Maria and neither does it like her.

Most of the plantation�۪s workers have understandably fled (and Maria�۪s ex wants to do the same) and both the army and the rebels including a ragtag band of child soldiers are fast approaching from different angles. The utopian promise of African liberation that reverberated throughout ���Chocolat�۝ has been replaced by the devastations of postcolonialism. Power has partly moved from white hands to black yet much remains the same including terror." terror creeps through this film quietly sneaking through tall grass slipping into buildings and moving with increasing tension among the characters. Eventually Ms. Denis brings the whole thing to a shocking end with a death blow that is as blunt in its execution as it is in its larger historical meaning. But before then she shows you an image of such astonishing poignancy and moral clarity that it will haunt you long after the film ends: a handful of child soldiers sleeping in a rumpled bed among scattered stuffed animals. With grave tenderness Ms. Denis reminds us that these murderous tragically lost boys and girls are still children a gesture that doesn�۪t restore their humanity ��� which she has no right to restore ��� so much as remind you of the humanity that�۪s so easily forgotten."

Becky is working as a producer on a New Jersey morning television show rising before the dawn to spread her light and warmth on her loving colleagues. But all is not well at least for the ruthlessly mechanical zippy minutes between her losing her job in New Jersey and landing a choicer gig in New York courtesy of a semi-skeptical executive (a buttery smooth Jeff Goldblum) with a last-place morning show. Before you know it Becky is skipping to work in her Louboutins (she might just make it after all!) and bringing the perky to the misery that is ���Daybreak.�۝" who was one of the creators of  ���Lost�۝  and directed last year�۪s smart reboot of ���Star Trek �۝ helped produce ���Morning Glory.�۝ It�۪s a bummer that any given episode in a network show like ���Lost �۝ even at its most muddled was tighter and conveyed greater respect for the audience�۪s intelligence (even as yes it tested your everlasting patience) than the entirety of ���Morning Glory.�۝ Ms. McKenna who adapted ���The Devil Wears Prada�۝ for the screen arms this script with laugh-out-loud lines only to undercut them with soggy filler involving Becky�۪s romance with another producer Adam (Patrick Wilson) and her equally suspense-free relationship with her reluctant new anchor the gruff and boozy Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford). The bland wall-to-wall pop songs ��� see Becky dress cue ���New Shoes�۝ ��� drum the obvious home." Ms. McAdams plays her role exceptionally well: as the young actress on the verge of the big time who can win the boy tame the beast flash her panties and make you smile without making you cringe she is a natural. Now if she can just persuade Mr. Abrams to give her a role worthy of them both. More than 20 years ago Holly Hunter played an unapologetically smart female professional with a quiver full of comebacks: ���It must be nice �۝ her boss says ���to always think you�۪re the smartest person in the room.�۝" it�۪s easy to get lost in the pleasure of her company or at least become enjoyably distracted. Effortlessly likable she has a way of keeping you tethered to her character even when your attention begins to wander. Such is the case in ���Morning Glory �۝ a passably amusing romantic comedy with a laugh-strewn script that�۪s almost undone by the hard sell of an enterprise that drills every emotional beat into your head an approach that suggests  that the filmmakers see their audiences less as viewers with  thinking brains and more as patients with thick skulls." slap-happy and just plain goofy ���Daybreak�۝ represents one of those  fantasy work families  in which few people do much visible labor. Instead they crack wise and snipe at one another tossing half-witticisms across meeting tables like overgrown sweathogs lobbing spitballs. One of the film�۪s smartest moves is that it waits until Becky lands in New York to prove to you just how good she is at her job which she does by silencing the rabble with rapid-fire orders and deadly seriousness on her first day. She also fires one of the hosts earning a round of applause from everyone save fans of ���Lost�۝ who might be sorry to see one of its cast members go."

Megamind is a master of disguises who in his funniest incarnation becomes a parody of Marlon Brando in ���Superman.�۝ Fragments of vintage hits include AC/DC�۪s ���Highway to Hell�۝ (symbolizing evil) and Minnie Riperton�۪s chirpy ���Lovin�۪ You �۝ (good). These references are just the outer layer of a compulsively referential screenplay that tries so hard it sounds like a classroom smart aleck reeling off answers before the questions are finished." Megamind faces an existential crisis. Without an opponent he has no purpose in life. The movie�۪s central joke ��� that good and evil are meaningless unless both exist in continual opposition ��� is unusually sophisticated for an animated movie. And the screenplay by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons plays that insight every which way." bored and at loose ends Megamind decides he must create a Metro Man replacement. Wielding his considerable but imperfect magic he transforms Hal (Jonah Hill) the nerdy redheaded cameraman for the local television station and the movie�۪s answer to Jimmy Olsen into the super-powered Tighten (also Mr. Hill). But Tighten an angry postadolescent outcast nursing many grudges quickly discovers that wreaking vengeance against a world that looked down on him is much more fun than doing good and he runs amok." the essential selves of Megamind and Metro Man are neither all good nor all bad. The film has a lot riding on how much ambiguity audiences accustomed to more clear-cut personifications of good and evil can tolerate." ���Megamind �۝ directed by Tom McGrath (both ���Madagascar�۝ movies) has a lot more in its head than the typical aspiring animated blockbuster including the more user-friendly ���Shrek�۝ movies.

Megamind lands in a Metro City prison where he learns evil while Metro Man is coddled in upper-middle-class comfort." �۝ blasted near the end of ���Megamind �۝ the witty 3-D animated deconstruction of superhero movies from DreamWorks Animation encapsulates the paradoxes of a story in which evil morphs into good and vice versa. There was always something innately silly in Jackson�۪s wispy-voiced childlike affectation of macho ferocity. My first reaction to a singer whose clout suggested a crooked finger more than a clenched fist was ���Oh come off it little boy.�۝" but their execution disappoints; he doesn�۪t reckon on the time it takes to upload a computer-generated program of mass destruction. You could apply the same lesson to pinpoint bombing by remote control." grinning Superman with a wavy Elvis haircut he wallows in self-satisfaction as the residents of Metro City heap glory on him. His jaw is a little too prominent his body a little too pumped his attitude a little too cocky for him to be trusted as an unassailable moral paragon. He isn�۪t really a hero; he�۪s just a star." the movie�۪s blue-faced green-eyed eggheaded title character whose grandiose evil schemes usually come to naught and who loses every battle with his not entirely virtuous nemesis Metro Man. Voiced by Will Ferrell Megamind is a hyper-sensitive brainiac who sounds a little like Stewie Griffin the weirdly effete child played by Seth MacFarlane in ���Family Guy�۝ (whose British accent is said to have been inspired by Rex Harrison). More Conehead than cave man Megamind whose lair is an abandoned power plant cluttered with machinery is a comic antihero for the age of the geek." a beautiful and fearless television news reporter coveted by Megamind Metro Man and Tighten alike. She is no pushover. When the preening flexing Tighten tries to wow her by repeatedly dropping her from on high then swooping down to scoop her up at the last second she is irritated by his showy stunts." ���You know I�۪m big I�۪m bad �۝ Megamind�۪s nature has largely triumphed over his nurture; heroism becomes him and Roxanne�۪s love looms as real possibility." there is Minion (David Cross) Megamind�۪s loyal assistant who has a fishbowl head the body of a robot gorilla and a fanged underbite.

Tex.; Cambridge Mass.; Philadelphia; Seattle; and Washington." the five members of this foursome follow the logic of their convictions to the end and the film is nervy enough to do the same. It sustains its comedy past the point of sensitivity or good feeling tickling the audience with matters that may be too painful too awful to contemplate otherwise and building toward an ending that manages to be grim appalling and uproarious all at once. You laugh until the laughter turns to ashes in your mouth. And then you laugh some more." low-budget style just a few steps removed from the inflammatory Web videos its characters try to make ���Four Lions�۝ is unsparing and yet also curiously affectionate. Taking place mainly in a nondescript lower-middle-class suburb with excursions to Pakistan and London the film proceeds through a barrage of multilingual heavily accented slang punctuated by bursts of nearly ���Jackass�۝-worthy slapstick some fatal.

Though he cannot aim a rocket launcher a failure that gets him and Waj thrown out of a training camp in Pakistan Omar can tell a rabbit from a chicken and he can see his comrades�۪ foolishness. This means that he can expand the movie�۪s comic range by making fun of them and also that he becomes a vessel for the audience�۪s sympathy. That he is a regular guy with a job as a security guard a good-humored wife (Preeya Kalidas) and a young son makes him all the more likable even as his likability makes his commitment to violence especially disturbing." powerful desire to blow something up sends the movie on its chaotic farcical journey. Perhaps in ascending order of intelligence? In that case Waj (Kayvan Novak) would probably come first since he cannot tell a chicken from a rabbit and studies Islamic doctrine in children�۪s books like ���The Cat Who Went to Mecca.�۝ He would be followed by Faisal (Adeel Akhtar) a dreamy timid soul whose big operational idea is to train crows to be suicide bombers." when Barry recruits Hassan (Arsher Ali) who expresses his religious beliefs through bad hip-hop rhymes he precipitates one of many schisms within the cell in particular because the leader Omar (Riz Ahmed) is jealous." say Udayan Prasad and Hanif Kureishi�۪s sensitive and prescient ���My Son the Fanatic �۝ Four Lions"" is not an examination of the social and psychological roots of British Muslim fundamentalism.

Crystal�۪s story comes straight from the play. Mr. Perry has scrambled around the order of the poems added his own connective tissue and characters and shifted the time to the present even while leaving resonant lines and swathes of passages intact. (���I usedta live in the world/now i live in harlem & my universe is six blocks.�۝) The film opens with three performers in a dance studio one of a number of nods to the play�۪s themes including an illegal abortion that is not the anachronism some might hope or believe. But there are changes including Mr. Perry�۪s love of melodramatic excess that initially seem antithetical to Ms. Shange�۪s ferociously unsentimental original." like that of Thandie Newton and Whoopi Goldberg who play a warring mother and daughter is doubtless its own justification. But the real draws in this version of ���For Colored Girls�۝ are the less familiar names like Kimberly Elise who plays Crystal Jo�۪s beleaguered assistant. Ms. Elise appeared in Jonathan Demme�۪s ���Beloved�۝ in 1998 (alongside Ms. Newton) and starred in the 2005 breakout hit ���Diary of a Mad Black Woman �۝ written by Mr. Tyler. She returns memorably in his new film as a woman who in surrendering to her abuse (Michael Ealy plays her desperate lover-tormentor) pays a price so harrowing it�۪s almost impossible to watch. Ms. Elise enrages you with Crystal�۪s acquiescence and then as she should she rips into your heart." based on the play ���For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf�۝ by Ntozake Shange; director of photography Alexander Gruszynski; edited by Maysie Hoy; music by Aaron Zigman; production design by Ina Mayhew; costumes by Johnetta Boone; produced by Mr. Perry Paul Hall and Roger M. Bobb; released by Lionsgate. Running time: 2 hours." but done right it�۪s thrilling ��� specific in its pain universal in its reach ��� and Mr. Perry works very hard and gets it mostly right. He succeeds even when art seems to have taken a back seat to commercial choices as in the casting of Janet Jackson who plays Jo a magazine editor cut along the same cool lines of Meryl Streep in ���The Devil Wears Prada.�۝ Ms. Jackson is to put it gently an actress of limited expression. But her quiet presence has force partly because of her eerie resemblance to her brother Michael though also because her character�۪s brittle hauteur self-involved privilege and artificiality has ��� like the martyrs in ermine played by the likes of Lana Turner ��� its own weird truth." including a rape that Mr. Perry crosscuts with an opera performance being watched by another character. The editing muddles his intentions yet the assault however awkwardly framed contains an astonishing detail of the flailing victim fixing her eyes on a clock waiting for an eternity to end. It�۪s a brilliant encapsulation of how life sometimes freezes in time."

In one scene played for broad laughs and loud outrage a nurse Juanita (the buoyant Loretta Devine) solicits money from Jo for her new health clinic for poor women. Jo icily rebuffs the request: ���I give to Africa. I give to AIDS.�۝ Later after her heart has been broken yet again Juanita picks up the pieces and with dry eyes and musicality recites some of Ms. Shange�۪s signature lines (���somebody almost walked off wid alla my stuff�۝) to a room of women chiming in with sisterhood ��� woman to woman ��� that is the play�۪s heart." it goes without saying a maximalist informed by theatrical traditions (from the church and his stage work on the chitlin�۪ circuit) and the golden age of Hollywood. He likes big moments glamorous stars swells of music and tears that fall like rain ��� and sometimes hail. For most of his career he has not been a good filmmaker in terms of making beautiful pictures and putting those images into kinetic motion though the same can be said of other name directors. He isn�۪t a visual stylist certainly. His strengths lay elsewhere including his work with performers which over the course of his prolific career has only improved as evidenced by his latest ���For Colored Girls �۝ a thunderous storm of a movie." Mr. Perry while busily establishing his economic independence has been finding his voice as a filmmaker. And here working with fine performers like Ms. Elise Anika Noni Rose Phylicia Rashad and Kerry Washington he sings the song the way he likes it ��� with force feeling and tremendous sincerity." it might seem a wonder that he continues to make movies. Except that Mr. Perry addresses his movies to  black audiences and until recently has shown relatively little interest in crossing over. His enormous commercial success with a mainly black audience and the often ferociously hostile reviews from mostly white critics might  seem symptomatic of an insurmountable racial divide. Black people love him and white people don�۪t get him and that sort of thing which might  be somewhat true but ignores that another important dividing line runs along taste and not color." the self-described choreopoem ���For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf.�۝ Inspired by ���our mothers �۝ including Isis Zora Neale Hurston Anna May Wong and Calamity Jane the work was first staged in 1974 as a work in progress and performed ever since including on Broadway. It is a classic of its unapologetic feminist era consisting of some 20 poems accompanied by choreographed movement and music including a blast of Martha and the Vandellas. The characters are seven  chromatically differentiated women (brown yellow purple red green blue and orange) from points across the country who recite ���dark phrases of womanhood�۝ (the first words in the play)  involving infanticide incest and other horrors.

Things worked out between Joe and Valerie and for their real-life models who are now the subjects of a terrifically entertaining movie. But that does not mean that justice was done or that truth prevailed." Sean Penn (Joseph Wilson) Sam Shepard (Sam Plame) Noah Emmerich (Bill) Bruce McGill (Jim Pavitt) David Andrews (I. Lewis Libby Jr.) Tim Griffin (Paul) Liraz Charhi (Dr. Zahraa) and Khaled Nabawy (Hamed)." a business consultant who had been a diplomat tries to suppress his frustration at how much his wife works and perhaps also his envy that she has a more important and glamorous job than he does." and Joe wages a noisy campaign to expose the culprits and to defend both of their reputations against an onslaught of spin innuendo and attempted character assassination." floridly argumentative while she is circumspect. Joe loves to be right and to tell other people that they are wrong whether at the dinner table or on television and his zeal comes into conflict with both Valerie�۪s ingrained habit of secrecy and her natural reserve." ���Fair Game�۝ does not disguise its  sympathies. Valerie a C.I.A. operative played with brisk energy by Naomi Watts is a paragon of professional commitment and sober initiative. Her specialty is nonproliferation and when in 2002 she is given the assignment of investigating Saddam Hussein�۪s nuclear and biological weapons programs she understands its significance for her own career and for the nation." a disciplined functionary tries to swallow her frustration and do as she is told. Joe played with splendid swaggering and affectionate pomposity by Sean Penn is more of a wild card. Dispatched to Niger at Valerie�۪s suggestion to check out allegations that Hussein  had purchased large quantities of uranium he finds nothing. When Mr. Bush in his State of the Union address contends that Iraq had indeed gone shopping for nuclear material in Africa Joe tries to set the record straight and then publishes an Op-Ed article in The New York Times to make his case." which folds video of some of the actual players into careful re-enactments. There are some embellishments ��� the exiled Iraqi doctor (Liraz Charhi) Valerie recruits is a fictional character as is her brother (Khaled Nabawy) a scientist living in Baghdad ��� and also a few omissions. Many  real names are dropped in the course of ���Fair Game �۝ which has a way of bringing attention to those that aren�۪t ���  for example Judith Miller the former reporter for The New York Times whose role in the Plame affair was big news at the time." quietest insight is that for people in jobs like hers careerism and dedication to a cause can be mutually reinforcing. The problem arises when Valerie�۪s sense of what the job requires ��� a dispassionate empirical analysis of the available intelligence ��� runs up against another agenda. When she and her colleagues find extensive evidence that Iraq is not actively developing weapons of mass destruction their conclusions are overridden by men from the office of the vice president most notably I. Lewis Libby Jr. known as Scooter and played as a smooth-talking demon by David Andrews. The bureaucrats charged with interpreting reality are trumped by the politicians whose avowed mission is to create reality." professionally ambitious and proud of their accomplishments live in material comfort and close to power juggling the demands of work and domesticity in the usual ways.

This narrow field of vision is mirrored in the main relationship with Peter an architect with a sleek wife and house forced to suffer Ethan�۪s ignorance and lower-class affectations. Ethan is a rube with a perm and delusions of acting grandeur as well as a  fount of mayhem but as a surrogate child he has lessons to teach the expectant father. Equal parts appealing and appalling innocence with a spark of anarchic menace Mr. Galifianakis is good enough to make you almost forget the movie." if barely in ���The Hangover �۝ a funnier more intricately plotted and ambitious movie. In that comedy three amigos (including one played by Mr. Galifianakis) wake up in a wrecked Vegas suite after a collective blackout during a bachelor party and find themselves the surprised custodians of a baby. Strapped to Mr. Galifianakis�۪s chest like a ticking bomb the baby is the story�۪s savviest touch. It�۪s an easy prop good for audience sighs and gasps but it also works like an amulet because its very presence protects the men signifying that all vulgar and violent evidence to the contrary they are father material." casual cussing dope dealing and a snapping snake." punching a child is one more ha-ha outrageous liberating act that men (at least on screen) experience in the wilds before returning to the little ladies tapping their feet back home. In ���Due Date�۝ the missus (Michelle Monaghan purely decorative) who�۪s married to Peter and pregnant (I didn�۪t notice if she was barefoot) is understandably eager for him to return for the Caesarean delivery of their first child. Like ���The Hangover �۝ ���Due Date�۝ creates two oppositional spaces for the sexes ��� the giant playground  in which men run riotously amok and the domestic sphere of waiting women ��� you know kind of like ���The Odyssey �۝ but with masturbation jokes and vomit." �۝ by contrast is the son of a hippie-ish space case (Juliette Lewis) whose profession low-rent digs and seemingly altered state both set the scene and effectively justify Peter�۪s brutality. If the dealer had taken care of her child if she didn�۪t sell drugs cleaned her house and controlled her children her son wouldn�۪t have been harmed. Maternal neglect sets up the joke and a wallop from a daddy-disciplinarian who�۪s every bit as ill behaved and finally uncontrolled as the child he hurts brings the funny home.

As Ethan (Zach Galifianakis) checks out the bud his reluctant companion Peter (Robert Downey Jr.) waits in the living room with the dealer�۪s two children. Peter has been kicked off a plane and forced into a car with Ethan and he isn�۪t happy. He swats away the children�۪s questions and mocks the girl and her brother who looks about 9 bounces a toy off Peter�۪s head in seeming retaliation. One thing leads to another and Peter punches the boy in the stomach so hard that the child doubles over which certainly gives the expression ���belly laugh�۝ new meaning." or doesn�۪t do much with Peter who as written by Mr. Phillips and three others remains an off-putting hollow man ��� a presumably unintentional lack of character development that represents the movie�۪s sole honest moment. Peter suffers a litany of abuse during his travels with Ethan receiving the kind of physical punishment ��� he�۪s shot with a rubber bullet and survives a crash ��� that some movies bestow on characters in order to tenderize them for the soft finish. He�۪s roughed up in a test run for what lies ahead. Yet he�۪s as obnoxious at the end as at the start. For Mr. Phillips a hero�۪s journey doesn�۪t mean betterment for all; it�۪s about giggling into the wind while riding shotgun in a world of trouble." and it�۪s all meant to be in good nasty fun. The director Todd Phillips who scored big last year with ���The Hangover �۝ isn�۪t saying in ���Due Date�۝ that it�۪s O.K. for an adult to strike a child. Mr. Phillips likes to push studio comedies to the edge of mainstream acceptability retrofitting old ideas (here ���Planes Trains and Automobiles�۝)  with new-school aggression and obscuring his social conservatism under the fig leaf of calculating comedy. But he�۪s too canny to make a movie in which an adult hurts any ol�۪ child. Rather in ���Due Date �۝ he tells us it is perfectly acceptable to laugh as a (much admired) movie star pretends to whale on a pesky child who ostensibly had it coming."

for Mr. Gibney the juiciest parts of this story weren�۪t the explicit sometimes banal details like Mr. Spitzer�۪s famous black socks. No the good stuff as far as Mr. Gibney�۪s movie and Mr. Elkind�۪s book theorize involves the power brokers who ��� enraged by Mr. Spitzer�۪s activism as attorney general specifically in his hard-charging capacity as the Sheriff of Wall Street ��� might have had something to do with his downfall. (Although the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time has indicated that they didn�۪t.) Mr. Spitzer had a lot of enemies by the time he became governor and quickly picked up more. One of those was Joseph L. Bruno the longtime former Republican majority leader of the New York State Senate who some in the Spitzer administration had unsuccessfully gone after in the scandal called Troopergate." in a syndicated piece titled ���Did Wall Street Nail Spitzer? �۝ the left-wing columnist Alexander Cockburn noted that in an interview with CNBC (which Mr. Gibney also samples) Mr. Langone seemed to have intimate knowledge of Mr. Spitzer�۪s activity: ���I know for sure he went himself to a post office and bought $2 800 worth of mail orders to send to the hooker �۝ he said adding ���I know somebody who was standing in back of him in line.�۝ Those swayed  by the argument in ���Client 9�۝ that  some of the rich and powerful whom Mr. Spitzer crusaded against might  have exploited his stupidity should  find all this enthralling.   Others might  just remember the hubris." photographs news reports shots of a glittering jewel-like New York ��� together in expert fashion though much of it is familiar including to readers of The New York Times which on March 10 2008 broke the story  that Mr. Spitzer had been linked to a prostitution ring. Two days later the governor ��� who as the state�۪s attorney general had overseen the 2004 bust of a prostitution ring  ��� resigned from office apologizing for not living ���up to what was expected of me.�۝ For two years  the 54th governor of New York had been a client of one of those high-end enterprises euphemistically called escort services that offered the ���girlfriend experience�۝ for $1 000 (and up) an hour." including the assertion that Mr. Spitzer hired three women in a single day which he denied. Somewhat unusually for a documentary Mr. Gibney hired an actress to recite lines  from interviews he conducted with Mr. Spitzer�۪s favorite playmate a chatty woman  who did not want to appear on camera. The use of actors in nonfiction film dates back at least to ���The March of Time �۝ newsreel-like shorts that were shown in movie theaters starting in 1935.  But it�۪s a  distraction here." Mr. Bruno was sentenced to two years in prison on federal corruption charges after receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from a businessman who wanted help from the Legislature. He remains free and the case is before a federal appeals court.)" what with his running a vigorous rehabilitation campaign  ��� you get the sense that the former governor of New York must have read his share of Greek classics. In Alex Gibney�۪s new documentary ���Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer �۝ Mr. Spitzer says that hubris played a role in his stumble.  Like Peter Elkind�۪s recent book ���Rough Justice: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer �۝  the movie quotes from a  2005 speech in which Mr. Spitzer jokingly describes a T-shirt that he was given with ���Hubris is terminal�۝ on it. After being exposed Mr. Spitzer told an aide ���Welcome to a Greek tragedy.�۝" though that�۪s probably not what Mr. Gibney was shooting for. While its full title suggests that ���Client 9�۝ is about the highs and lows in one powerful man�۪s life the movie is more rightly an anatomy of political gamesmanship at a high level. Coming seven months  after the publication of  ���Rough Justice �۝ it is also the fruit of a cross-media partnership. Previously Mr. Elkind helped write a book about Enron ���The Smartest Guys in the Room �۝ which Mr. Gibney turned into a movie. This time they chased the Spitzer story separately while ���sharing ideas and information along the way.�۝" Maryse Alberti; edited by Plummy Tucker; music by Peter Nashel; produced by Mr. Gibney Jedd Wider Todd Wider and Maiken Baird; released by Magnolia Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 58 minutes." Mr. Bruno a former boxer and notorious political pugilist makes a colorful entertaining interview subject as does the strategist Roger Stone. Both men are  important stops on the trail of bread crumbs that Mr. Gibney persuasively sprinkles  and that leads to Maurice R. Greenberg the former chairman of A.I.G. and that snakes over to Kenneth G. Langone a co-founder of Home Depot and a former director of the New York Stock Exchange. As attorney general Mr. Spitzer sued Mr. Greenberg and A.I.G. and named Mr. Langone in a suit for his part in the compensation package paid to Richard A. Grasso the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange whose $139.5 million haul  became emblematic of Wall Street greed."

Mallory is and isn�۪t a child herself though that truth takes time for Doug to absorb. When he sweeps her up there�۪s benevolence in his embrace but also greed: his grief and to a lesser extent Lois�۪s feeds the story but so does their neediness.

The first thing you see is a graveyard and the first sound you hear is whistling." in his way a delicate even fastidious creature precise in his work habits and a little fussy in his tastes. The bantering sexually lively rapport that he has with his wife Fran̤oise (Marie Bunel) suggests both a long and loving marriage and perhaps some troubled water under the bridge.

And his sleuthing seems more like a hobby than a job since it allows Bellamy to escape from the other genres that keep encroaching on the policier that bears his name. If not for the murder he might be the hapless husband in a domestic comedy; the helpless brother in a tragic tale of sibling rivalry; the subject of an unsparing psychological case study.

I don�۪t mean to make Mr. Depardieu sound grotesque except that his magnetic menacing physicality has always contained an element of ugliness.

Far better there�۪s also that girl the genius computer hacker played by Noomi Rapace.  Although bulkier and older than Larsson�۪s pin-weight creation Ms. Rapace over the course of the three movies has made this tricky irresistible character her own a particularly noteworthy achievement given that Lisbeth (who might be autistic) leans to degrees of expressive inexpressiveness. With her hard gaze and underlying menace Ms. Rapace ��� with Salander as her guide ��� holds your attention in these mostly unmemorable movies. Particularly crucial is her punishingly physical performance which underscores that this is very much a story about what some  men do to women�۪s bodies." tied up like a pig being prepped for the knife and shot one two three times (in one go) the little woman with the large tattoo can sit back in her cool digs and enjoy a much deserved smoke. It�۪s been a long time coming literally what with seven hours of art house pulp craziness ��� Nazis and child molesters an evil psychiatrist and a prostitution ring ��� which among other things proves that women in trouble never go out of style." ���The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet�۪s Nest�۝ trades on the spectacle of female suffering including a repeat of the ghastly rape in the first flick. At the same time as in certain slasher films from the 1970s and high-end thrillers that borrow from a similar horror playbook the violence against women in the Millennium movies is answered by a young woman the one  whose bad attitude is as unapologetic as that of any male avenger. Salander hits (and sometimes shoots) back and  never says sorry.  Every so often she responds to some violence with a small mean smile that the camera makes sure to capture. There�۪s satisfaction in that smile maybe cynicism but no evident  moral complexity." with neatly tied loose ends and closing remarks if one that plays out as something of a secular passion play. That Lisbeth has been nearly martyred again and again in a crucible of male violence is part of the trilogy�۪s kink and probably a large part of its appeal. Unfortunately for those who like to see Salander in flamboyant action she spends much of this movie confined first in a hospital and then in jail where she prepares for the court trial that will seal her fate partly by working out like a wee Travis Bickle. For her life has been defined by continuous suffering and raging battles with enemies fought on all fronts: mental physical technological and legal." it�۪s because the sins individual and institutional of the father or rather fathers weighed heavily on the trilogy. The overarching narrative is filled with the evil that men do to women ��� wives daughters prostitutes even unlucky female passers-by. But the villains aren�۪t simply isolated rogues as they tend to be in American movies; they�۪re also systems of oppression ranging from the nominally personal (abusive parent and child) to the overtly political (oppressed citizen and state). For her part Salander might be a loner but she believes in collective action waging war with the help of a few good men chiefly Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist reliably appealing) an activist left-wing journalist." and his work is again essentially functional limited to clumsy action sequences and television-ready conversations. He doesn�۪t prettify the violence in either movie which might be unintentional but makes them feel more honest than the first did. That more visually ambitious effort directed by Niels Arden Oplev softened all the ugliness with haunted wintry tableaus whereas Mr. Alfredson has to make do with a Stockholm that hardly conveys a noir nightmare. It looks so banal which ��� with the hot bisexual babe and heroic leftist journalist ��� might explain why a revenge fantasy as crudely plotted disreputably pleasurable and aesthetically irredeemable as any churned out in the lower cinematic depths has made it to American art houses. Here payback seems so civilized."

Because members flow in and out at different times of the day and night sometimes for classes sometimes to work out on their own the gym can seem free-form even anarchic. Children roam around at will babies lie nestled in corners and in one shot a dog gnaws on a bone. As in all communities there�۪s order even in ostensible disorder and hierarchies are evident in the division of labor (one guy vacuums the floor; others train the boxers;  Mr. Lord negotiates memberships) and in the class differences that crop up in some of the conversations." partly because of their coiled strength and confidence. But you also notice that none of the men seem to be checking them out. Boxing is a gravely serious business at Lord�۪s where everything looks battered not just some of the faces. Most of the heavy bags are swaddled in duct tape and the walls lined with mirrors and posters (���Raging Bull�۝) look as if they hadn�۪t been painted since Hagler vs. Duran.

Given this it�۪s noteworthy that one of the first images in ���Boxing Gym�۝ is of two ancient Greek boxers in midfight a reproduction that looks as if it had been torn out of a book and taped to the wall. In the ���Iliad�۝ Homer writes about a match after the warring is over that ends with one of the boxers being carried off  by his comrades who ���led him  out of the circle feet dragging as he spat up the thick blood and rolled his head over on one side.�۝ The fighter was dizzy but they were alive and now it was time for their opponents to mourn and bury their dead." which with the gym�۪s humble size allows you to move into the space quickly. This sense of familiarity is accentuated by the camerawork which narrows in on small zones in which the members hit a speed bag here jump rope over there. Unlike the studios staircases and workrooms of the Palais Garnier in Paris which  Mr. Wiseman roamed through for his last documentary ���La Danse�۝ (about the Paris Opera Ballet) the gym feels intimate as does this newest film.

In the movie Carlos steps into the abyss created by the loss of political hope and fills it with blood and terror playing to the faithful with anti-imperialist rhetoric and a pantomime of that old-time revolutionary feeling. It�۪s no wonder everyone wants a piece of him dead or alive and sometimes on the payroll: warring governments admiring partisans bickering women.

It�۪s 1974 and after a bungled assassination attempt and an ineffectual bombing Carlos has just headed down the flamboyant career path ��� riddled with bodies rutted by explosions and festooned with publicity ��� that will inspire pulp fictions detailed biographies hyperventilated conspiracy theories and lasting myths. As he luxuriates in his own image you see how Carlos saw himself: the terrorist as pinup." both for Mr. Assayas who runs out of steam and for Carlos who stricken with a testicular pain ends up clutching his genitals once more. This concluding chapter is something of a drag even if it completes the portrait. By then Carlos is seeking work with fundamentalist Iran and adrift in  Sudan looking every bloated inch like the bourgeois narcissist that his lover once accused him of being.

It isn�۪t that Mr. Assayas doesn�۪t have strong opinions only that because he wants to move beyond familiar axioms ��� Carlos the monster Carlos the cool ��� he shows history as it�۪s happening active and dynamic rather than how it will be subsequently narrated.

The black-and-white news footage that follows sets the context as a voice-over speculates that the bomb might have been the work of the Israeli secret service in retaliation for the murderous attack on Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics. From there it�۪s a hop skip and abrupt cut to Lebanon where Carlos meets a leader of the Popular Front Haddad (Ahmad Kaabour) offering up his warrior bona fides in one of the few awkward expository passages in the generally sharp script by Mr. Assayas and Dan Franck." he joins forces with radical zealots and together they zigzag across Europe and the Middle East racking up victims and notoriety. Mr. Assayas�۪s fast pans and jump-cuts create an almost frenzied sense of history inexorably hurtling forward even as the character at the center of this ferment sometimes seems scarcely as motivated. Carlos might be an ideologue as well as a braggart ��� ���You may have heard of me �۝ he announces to some hostages ��� but his rhetoric has none of the passion of his violence.

The disparity between the original and copy might have been necessary to finance a 330-minute look back at a moldering terrorist but a glammed-up Carlos also allows Mr. Assayas to get close to the character showing you the idealist-turned-mercenary in his self-regarding element as the filmmaker takes the longer cooler intellectual view."

Most of the interviewees are at least from the perspective of the filmmaker friendly witnesses adding fuel to the director�۪s comprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced capitalist countries for the past two decades." �۝ a sleek briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie is the story of a crime without punishment of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The betrayal of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and damaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne�۪s novel which treated Hester more as scapegoat than villain." they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. Accordingly Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers George W. Bush Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers." Iceland and other disaster areas ��� are folded into a clear and absorbing history narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an opening song ���Big Time �۝ by Peter Gabriel and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen cinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the movie�۪s themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied privileged worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished and the elegance of the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film�۪s authority. This is not a piece of ragged muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason research and careful argument." some investment bankers ��� at Goldman Sachs in particular ��� were betting against the positions they were pushing on their customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in which bad consumer loans were bundled into securities which were certified as sound by rating agencies paid by the banks and then insured via credit-default swaps.

Visible hands write laws and make deals and in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems to have driven very intelligent men (and they were mostly men) toward folly. In addition to business and government Mr. Ferguson aims his critique at academia suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a few prominent economists were corrupted by consulting fees seats on boards of directors and membership in the masters of the universe club." ���No End in Sight �۝ which focused on catastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W.

Some of these prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson�۪s camera less to gloat than to present once again the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long." the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its fate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters nitpicked in others and shrugged off by those who need its message most. Which is a shame." in particular those who held positions of responsibility in the White House or in the Federal Reserve they are reduced to stammering obfuscation ��� Markets are complicated! Who could have predicted? I don�۪t see any conflict of interest ��� and occasionally provoked to testiness. Mr. Ferguson for his part cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. Occasionally his voice pipes up from off camera saying things like ���You can�۪t be serious!�۝" which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous as it goes on is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject matter make ���Inside Job�۝ feel like a classroom lecture at times but by the end Mr. Ferguson has summoned the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor restraint and good humor makes his case all the more devastating." though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government oversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and continued during the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives expanded and alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored.

The spot of territory it claims which could only be in England is a picturesque rural village populated by recognizable types not all of them traditional rustics." we learn through flashbacks Tamara had a big nose which plastic surgery has trimmed. Her newly revealed beauty renders the local men slack-jawed though that may have more to do with the tank top and denim shorts she likes to wear than with her facial structure. In any case Tamara is soon contending with three possible suitors: the farmer who is recovering from some tragic bad luck; the philandering novelist; and a vain and snarly rock star who shows up in town with his dog." not exactly effortlessly (one appealing aspect of his writing is its blunt lack of grace) but with craft and conviction. And at times Mr. Frears and his cast almost succeed in making this odd contraption work. Mr. Camp and Ms. Grieg excellent actors whose characters at first seem to be designated spectators in the libidinous games being played around them provide a touching and satisfying subplot as the hapless scholar and the wronged wife are brought together by shared disappointment in love and a shared love of literature." like much else in the busy buzzy plot is engineered by two bored schoolgirls (Jessica Barden and Charlotte Christie) who amuse themselves by manipulating the adults. These Fates-in-training especially the slit-eyed Ms. Barden give ���Tamara Drewe�۝ a spark of real mischief. Without them and to some extent with them the movie often feels more creaky than chipper as it tries to find an emotional tone that combines bouncy sexual humor domestic melodrama and psychological realism." knockabout gags sparkling chatter and at the climax a violent and gruesome death all of it somehow tied together with the bright ribbon of a happy ending." starring Katherine Heigl or Amy Adams or Jennifer Lopez is likely to allow its heroine to go to bed with three different men and though this movie may leave you wondering what Tamara sees in any of them (even the hunky farmer) it spares her the lash of judgment. Disapproval is reserved for actions that betray trust or cause pain to others." which strains to maintain a glib cheery demeanor that is not always appropriate to the details of the story. It is more honest and clever than most recent romantic comedies but that may not be a sign of progress. Earlier in his career Mr. Frears made his name with ���My Beautiful Laundrette �۝ ���Prick Up Your Ears�۝ and ���Sammy and Rosie Get Laid �۝ three movies about England and sex (among other things) that in their riskiness and insight make ���Tamara Drewe�۝ look like a big step backward." but who knows? ��� over this movie. Posy Simmonds�۪s graphic novel on which it is closely based is a loose and whimsical adaptation of ���Far From the Madding Crowd �۝ Hardy�۪s 1874 novel about the romantic travails of Bathsheba Everdene. The book was memorably filmed by John Schlesinger in 1967 with Julie Christie as Bathsheba. In this updated version the character has been reimagined as Tamara Drewe a newspaper columnist played by Gemma Arterton who returns to her childhood home after a long absence to find herself caught in a thicket of entangled and clashing desires."

You can understand why the filmmakers  didn�۪t want to make just another genre movie in which everything falls neatly into place. They want to mess with our heads but intelligently. The paradox is that what they try to subvert in ���Stone�۝ ��� namely your viewing habits ��� are intrinsic to your enjoyment of the movie. They summon up past pulp delights with a couple of baddies and a dame with snake hips and eyes only to toss them out in exchange for an ending that is unpredictable yet also flat. They end up subverting expectations by denying pleasure."

The writer Angus MacLachlan (���Junebug�۝) and the director John Curran (���The Painted Veil �۝ in which Mr. Norton starred)  bank on your familiarity with genre conventions and they count on your expectations of what happens when those conventions are deployed in a movie that looks and talks as tough as this one.

They spend their evenings swilling booze and listening to more religious chatter a habit that Stone sets out to break by dangling his own wife Lucetta (Milla Jovovich) in front of Jack�۪s dead eyes." will he or won�۪t he? None of the performers tip a hand as to where they are eventually headed. A restrained Mr. Norton and a tamped-down Mr. De Niro make fine opponents though their best scenes play out separately. A mercurial Ms. Jovovich helps turn up the heat partly by stripping off her clothes while Ms. Conroy who played the matriarch on HBO�۪s  ���Six Feet Under �۝ adds a spooky touch. After the characters have been locked in place the filmmakers  let some blood run and spurt. It�۪s a gruesome display that adds to the unease but it�۪s also a distraction because not long after the  narrative  takes a hard sharp turn away from the pulp-fiction terrain they have effectively mapped out." �۝ a brooding low-key intrigue Mr. Norton wears cornrows and tattoos and much as he did in his screen debut ���Primal Fear �۝ keeps his performance in check. He plays the title character in the new movie an arsonist turned inmate who�۪s grown weary of waiting to be released.

���Secretariat�۝ doesn�۪t take the wide or long view when it comes to horse racing or anything else despite an occasional oblique nod to Vietnam. Instead it sticks to the Disney gospel that life means following your dreams which here belong largely to those who surrounded Secretariat in his glory years including his owner Penny Chenery (Ms. Lane sincere and dulled down) and trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich insincere and showboating). Don�۪t fret though: there are plenty of pretty horses ��� and a few hilarious close-ups of Secretariat and a rival at the starting gate eyeballing each other like boxers in the ring ��� even if the triumph here is of the human spirit and not the horse." a delightful idea that the movie embraces by showing him turn to the cameras. And certainly the movie flirts with the standard Disney take on animals as sentient creatures in command of their destinies and serving human needs. Yet this fuzzy humanism is at odds with the movie�۪s other message ��� deliriously blasted during the final race of the Triple Crown with reprises of Job and ���Oh Happy Day�۝ ��� that Secretariat galloped down the stretch guided by something other than the jockey�۪s crop." �۝ not little details like life.

Money played a part though it generally doesn�۪t in the movie an exception being Penny�۪s shrewd decision to sell shares in Secretariat�۪s future as a sire. Every so often mainly when one of the digital cameras is hovering right next to the horse as he tears down the track his legs churning and breath hammering you can pretend that Secretariat ran because he could and not because someone put a saddle on him and rode him out of the gate. It�۪s a pleasurable seductive fantasy partly because as we have known from the start of cinema the sight of a running horse is a beautiful thing." �۝ a gauzy gooey turf-pounding Bible-thumping tribute to the celebrated 1970s thoroughbred from the wonderful weird world of Disney. But the bigger and truer stars of this enjoyable sometimes accidentally entertaining movie are the five horses that take turns playing Secretariat ��� one was used for running another posed for the cameras ��� along with the memory of that original breathtaking beauty.

The real woman hired the William Morris Agency to book Secretariat�۪s appearances and said of her horse-racing life ���I love the prestige the excitement and the money.�۝ The movie�۪s Penny spends a lot of time fretting and every so often stares meaningfully into Secretariat�۪s eyes (or muzzle).

Eventually everyone does pay: the Winklevosses Eduardo even Mark. The filmmakers have their ideas about who did what to whom but they don�۪t try to fill in all the blanks or worse soften Mark�۪s edges with a Psych 101 back story. You see what turns him on: software revenge and in several lightly comic and darkly foreboding scenes Sean Parker the flamboyant co-creator of Napster who�۪s played by Justin Timberlake as a jittery seducer.

The benign view of Facebook is that it creates ���a community �۝ a sense of intimacy which is of course one reason it also creeps out some of its critics.

In ���The Social Network �۝ a character lashes out at both Mark and ���the angry�۝ who haunt the Internet but Mr. Lanier takes the view that it�۪s fear that drives the idolizers of what he calls the ���new strain of gadget fetishism.�۝" though there are moments when it has the flavor of science fiction (it would make a nice double bill with ���The Matrix�۝) even as it evokes 19th-century narratives of ambition. (���To be young to have a thirst for society to be hungry for a woman �۝ Balzac writes in ���Le P̬re Goriot.�۝) The movie opens with a couple in a crowded college bar and ends with a man alone in a room repeatedly hitting refresh on his laptop.

You don�۪t learn much about him other than the headlines beginning with Facebook�۪s less-than-humble start in 2003. Despite its insistently unsexy moving parts (software algorithms) the movie is paced like a thriller if one in which ideas words and bank books blow up rather than cars.

Mr. Fincher turns down the lights and tamps down his visual style deploying fewer special-effects sleights of hand than he did in ���The Curious Case of Benjamin Button �۝ with its wizened and baby Brad Pitt while also maintaining the familiar Fincher atmosphere of dread. Harvard has rarely been represented to  such dolorous effect as in ���The Social Network �۝ where even the colors seem leached of joy.

(When Mr. Eisenberg makes Mark�۪s face go blank the character seems scarily emptied out: it�۪s a subtly great at times unsettling performance.) Mark might be the brains in this unlikely friendship but Eduardo is its conscience and slowly bleeding heart. Though he knows better he hangs on even after he�۪s been cut loose."

Occasionally it even appears to take up temporary residence in someone�۪s head ��� dive-bombing toward the back of a skull like a blow ��� so that it (and we) can see the world directly from another point of view: This is your brain. This is your brain on a Gaspar No̩ movie." this intimacy between you and the character (and by extension the filmmakers) is as much an ethical stance ��� they bring you close to the blessed and the damned ��� as it is a narrative strategy. ���Enter the Void�۝ is a different kind of beast partly because it�۪s told through Oscar�۪s sustained point of view. This subject position  ��� in which the camera a character and the audience share the same look ��� can be very powerful allowing you to see through a character�۪s eyes in blissful or terrifying communion. The dreamlike shot of James Stewart�۪s character pushing open a flower-shop door to gaze at a resplendent Kim Novak in Hitchcock�۪s ���Vertigo �۝ for instance is one of the most haunting in cinema." if only because by the second section the camera is freed from the constraints of normal human activity. That�۪s true even though from the start of the film we share Oscar�۪s literal perspective seeing what he sees. It�۪s an unusual vantage. Movies generally try to lock you into the  story by placing a camera in intimate proximity with a character as with over-the-shoulder shots. We�۪re so accustomed to these conventions that we tend to notice only the deviations as in the work of Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne (���The Son�۝) where the camera sometimes hovers so near to a character�۪s ear that you can�۪t see much else in the shot creating a sense of shared vision." �۝ despite its attempt to fuse man with machine is scarcely as friendly though it�۪s certainly a personal work. If you care about strong stories don�۪t bother. Hardly anything happens here in conventional movie terms though there�۪s plenty of decorative pulp ��� drug dealers drug abusers pole dancers love-hotel clients ��� none of it gripping. Oscar�۪s sister played by Paz de la Huerta in a monotone and with her customary lack of clothes is easy on the eyes if hard on the ears. And the scene of a cataclysmic accident that the siblings shared once upon a time is stunning at least the first time around.

Los Angeles and Chicago." �۝ where with beauty mild and sharp jolts and mesmerizing camerawork he tries to open the doors of perception. Set primarily in Tokyo and often at night the film is divided into two sections. In the first a young American Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) smokes some hallucinogens ��� the screen exploding with phosphorescent biomorphic forms ��� walks around buys and sells drugs and discusses the Tibetan Book of the Dead. In the second section Oscar�۪s spirit (or something) appears to separate from his apparently dying body gazing down at the bleeding man curled on the floor. The flesh will surely rot but the spirit will continue the journey plunging into the night and darker memories." the subjective point of view can seem like a gimmick even weird as if the camera were mounted on the character�۪s neck instead of the head. You begin to wonder how the trick was pulled off which can break the narrative spell or so conventional wisdom insists. In truth viewers are more adaptive than moviemaking manuals. And indeed sustained point-of-view shots are more common in nonfiction cinema where we are trained to see through the eyes of filmmakers holding cameras as in ���The Gleaners and I�۝ (2000) Agn̬s Varda�۪s poetic essay about collecting and other pursuits. In that movie the first-person form of address is intensely personal because the filmmaker�۪s body sometimes seems one with the camera ��� she fills the apparatus with her humanity."

This film is not rated." ���Enter the Void�۝ is the latest from the never uninteresting sometimes exasperating Mr. No̩ whose films like ���Irrev̩rsible�۝ (2002) skew toward provocations filled with flashes of genius and irredeemable nonsense. The title of ���Enter the Void �۝ which sounds like both a dare and a fun-house attraction makes sense in a work about death and other hard times but it also expresses Mr. No̩�۪s bad-boy punk attitude which can be hard to take seriously. His insistence on representing ugly extremes (incest rape murder) can be especially wearisome coming across as weak bids to shock his audience (̩pater la bourgeoisie as the French poets once said) which already expecting (perhaps eagerly) a Gaspar No̩ freakout is unlikely to have its world genuinely rocked. But bring it on Gaspar!" you keep watching. I have twice happily ��� the first time at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival where the movie ran 17 minutes longer. The cuts haven�۪t hurt the film as far as I can tell though I preferred the extended-play version because there seemed to be more astral-drift and trippy flowers. Whatever the case those blooms are a nice change for Mr. No̩ who�۪s overly fond of grossing you out. Speaking of which be warned: there�۪s a graphic scene of an abortion near the end that�۪s capped with a ludicrously intact fetus a scene that speaks more to Mr. No̩�۪s debt to Stanley Kubrick and the  star child in ���2001�۝ than to the ostensible spiritual themes in ���Enter the Void.�۝ Of course for some Kubrick is God.

Jack is more diffident and less emphatically representative. He is not presented as someone just like us but rather as someone we should pity and wonder about." Mr. Hoffman ��� more in his capacity as director than in his portrayal of Jack ��� fights against this impulse. For every scene of heavily telegraphed mopiness there is at least one that finds delicacy and humanity in the give-and-take of daily life.

But the description might be even better suited to ���Catfish �۝ a documentary by Henry Joost and Ariel Shulman that caused some hyperventilation at the Sundance Film Festival last winter." the story goes like this: A few years ago Nev Shulman the younger brother of one of the filmmakers was befriended  by a  girl in Michigan named Abby who seemed to be an artistic prodigy. She wanted permission to use one of Nev�۪s photographs as the basis of a painting and in the course of their correspondence revealed that she was at the age of 8 exhibiting and selling her work online and in galleries in her hometown. Nev�۪s fraternal friendship with Abby led to a warm rapport with her mother Angela and also to a blossoming cyberflirtation with Megan the girl�۪s 19-year-old sister who posted enticing profile pictures on her Facebook page." an ancient New Yorker cartoon caption observes nobody knows you�۪re a dog. But everyone assumes you�۪re a sucker susceptible to the pleas of hard-luck Nigerian royalty or eager to enhance your sexual prowess. You can have so many friends fans and followers that you might not grasp just how radically alone you really are." not entirely unsurprising twist that lies like a booby trap in the middle of the film and the choice is either to reveal what happens or forgo a discussion of the movie�۪s logic and meaning. The directors and the distributors would obviously prefer the second option but the expectation of discretion is a trap. So consider yourself warned. I�۪ll try not to spell out too much but neither am I willing to play along in a rigged game." who tells the story that gives the movie its title but everything that is radical disturbing and true about ���Catfish�۝ belongs to the fabulist at its center. Mr. Shulman and Mr. Joost will continue to enjoy the success and cachet of having made a pop culture conversation piece which is a tribute to their good luck and nimble opportunism. But the dark genius of their film lies elsewhere beyond the parameters of its slick intentions in the wild social ether where nobody knows who anybody is." but in spite of its own facile faux-na��f manipulations ���Catfish�۝ reveals her to be something else as well namely an artist. Mr. Joost and Mr. Shulman young and entitled filmmakers assume that the sophistication is all on their side but Angela�۪s mastery of the media of modern self-expression ��� from painting to social media to her very being  ��� surpasses theirs in every way." or more narcissistic?

Plain-looking and soft-spoken she seemed to be either a clown or a monster." it is a wretched documentary: visually and narratively  sloppy; coy about its motives; slipshod in its adherence to basic ethical norms.

Working with the cinematographer Adam Kimmel and the production designer Mark Digby Mr. Romanek creates a plausible coherent world particularly at Hailsham where the children�۪s monochromatic uniforms and their muted affect are mirrored by interiors similarly drained of vibrancy.

Much as Mr. Ishiguro does Mr. Romanek reveals his secrets slowly and scatters his hints carefully isolating crucial moments like the children�۪s  ��� and later the adults�۪  ��� indifferently passing their metal bracelets over a kind of device as if they were workers electronically punching the clock. The first time you see them do this it raises a question that like other Hailsham rituals and curiosities remains unanswered. By the time the young adults swipe in the casualness of their gestures the nonchalance with which they wear these electronic leashes will give you pause." a perfectly lighted Ms. Mulligan stares out at a perfectly framed slice of countryside and in a soft near-monotone needlessly explains the film we�۪ve been watching. Everything looks as it sometimes does in the movies including the large tree that looms over her like a sheltering hand the soft light that spills around her and even the scraps of refuse fluttering on wire fencing before her. Everything is in its place including the overly tidied-up meaning. Alas what�۪s missing is the spark of life the jolt of the unexpected  ��� something beyond tears  ��� to puncture the falseness of a film world which by its insistence on  its own beauty obscures the tragedy that the three characters by their nature cannot express." literal and emotional the scenes at the institution are among the strongest partly because the mysteries are still shrouded and partly because the children being both children and unknowns and therefore generally lacking in self-conscious mannerisms make better company than the three occasionally struggling adult leads. Eventually the story shifts from the past to the near past when Kathy Ruth and Tommy have left Hailsham for some more dilapidated and cheerless accommodations called the Cottages.

In time they timidly make their way into the world which turns out to be crueler than most of us would I suspect like to believe. Though here cruelty is done so prettily and with such caution that the sting remains light giving the entire enterprise the aspect of a tasteful shocker." like ���donations�۝ and ���completion �۝ would be unfair. One of the pleasures of ���Never Let Me Go �۝ on the page and on screen comes from the detective work the story requires whether you�۪re noting Mr. Ishiguro�۪s use of verbs like ���huddle�۝ and ���wander �۝ or the way that Mr. Romanek groups actors in the image. All this tells you something as does Ms. Knightley and Mr. Garfield�۪s droopy loose-limbed physicality which has none of the coiled energy of youth and serves the story even if neither actor can manage its delicate passages.

Another character Serge (Pierre Louis-Calixte) provides some modest diversion. Mousse guzzles beer and prescription methadone. And in one scene of her bathing she looks at herself in a mirror doubling her image. She then lies back and cups her belly with her hands a gesture that suggests that this woman who seconds before was captivated by or  just lost in her own reflection has begun perhaps for the first time to think about the life growing inside her." partly because at first it�۪s unclear if Mr. Ozon is sentimentalizing his characters or groping for spiritual substance. (Mothers and their children have with varying meaning and impact populated some of Mr. Ozon�۪s other  films most recently in ���Ricky �۝ a fable about an infant who sprouts wings and ���Time to Leave �۝ a melodrama about a dying man.) But while the Piet�� imagery startles it makes increasing sense as the story builds around it.

His interpretations of the piano repertory ��� the work of Bach in particular ��� were fresh and provocative and his self-presentation was both matinee-idol charismatic and winningly odd. As Gould�۪s celebrity grew some of his peculiarities became as famous as his playing. He insisted on sitting in a special low-slung chair so that his long arms seemed to angle upward to the keyboard.

Anyone who sees both ���Blood Simple�۝ and ���Noodle Shop�۝ will be struck by the obsessive formal discipline that unites these otherwise disparate filmmakers and also by Mr. Zhang�۪s preservation and alteration of certain details from the original: a combination lock; tobacco-smoking paraphernalia; murder weapons."

And now for no good reason but with reasonably happy (which is to say grisly) results Mr. Zhang has honored the unlikely affinity between himself and the Coens with a faithful remake of their first movie a replica  of ���Blood Simple�۝ called (in America) ���A Woman a Gun and a Noodle Shop.�۝" almost clownish business and includes a handful of clean and mordant sight gags ���A Woman a Gun and a Noodle Shop�۝ has a gravity that is surprising given that it is basically the pastiche of a pastiche. But by working through the self-conscious genre imitation that was something of a novelty in ���Blood Simple �۝ Mr. Zhang uncovers the primal mythic intensity of the story and also changes the tone of its essential nihilism. The Coens posit a universe without order or meaning and while Mr. Zhang does not necessarily quarrel with this view he treats it less as a cosmic joke than as a grim folk tale." fed up with his boorishness and sexual sadism is carrying on with Li (Xiao Shenyang) one of his employees who dresses in pink and blends skittishness with a certain anxious decency. The wife   steps into a long tradition of Zhang Yimou heroines going back to the defiant tragic women played by Gong Li in movies like ���The Story of Qiu Ju �۝ ���Shanghai Triad�۝ and ���Raise the Red Lantern.�۝ She is stubborn abrasive and operatically self-expressive ���  her emotions far too grand for her mean tawdry surroundings.

The action has moved from modern semisuburban Texas to a rocky and desolate valley in northwest China at some unspecified point in the feudal past. Squadrons of imperial police thunder through the mountains on horseback but otherwise an eerie quiet predominates throwing the deceptively simple story into sharp relief." a taciturn detective hired by Wang to kill the adulterous couple. The character of Zhang is both the closest point of contact between ���Noodle Shop�۝ and ���Blood Simple�۝ and the source of their greatest divergence. What he does is from scene to scene almost identical to what M. Emmet Walsh did as Loren Visser in the Coens�۪ movie but Mr. Sun has a quiet deadpan manner that not only contrasts with Mr. Walsh�۪s giggly whispery menace but also has the effect of completely altering the tone of the story. Zhang�۪s actions seem to spring not like Visser�۪s from perverse greedy corruption but rather from adherence to a deep unspoken code. He is a thief and a liar as well as a cold-blooded killer but his air of quiet melancholy makes him seem like the most soulful person in the area and also somehow the most ethical."

�۝ the Israeli director Yael Hersonski embarks on a critical analysis of ���Das Ghetto�۝ that is remarkable as much for its speculative restraint as for its philosophical reach. Moving methodically reel by reel and acknowledging the ���many layers of reality �۝ the director creates a palimpsest of impressions from multiple meticulously researched sources representing both victims and oppressors." these images were subjected to a radical rereading with the appearance of another reel in 1998: 30 minutes of outtakes showing the extent to which scenes had been deliberately staged. Over and over in multiple takes we see well-dressed Jews enter a butcher�۪s shop ignoring the children begging outside. In a similar scenario prosperous-looking passersby are directed to disregard the corpses abandoned on the sidewalk. The propagandists�۪ manipulation of their half-million prisoners was now clear even as its eventual purpose ��� perhaps more than just to manufacture scenes showing callousness on the part of wealthy Jews toward their less fortunate brethren ��� remained as murky as ever." one of the cameramen who worked on ���Das Ghetto �۝ are as evasive as one might expect other witnesses did not hold back. Readings from personal diaries like those of Adam Cherniakov the head of the Jewish Council (whose apartment was used by the Nazis to stage several scenes) and from the minutely detailed reports of the ghetto commissioner Heinz Auerswald provide vivid insight into the restrictions of daily life and the methods of the Nazi filmmakers." however the value of Ms. Hersonski�۪s work lies less in what is shown than in her persistent reminders of what is not. By drawing our attention repeatedly to the filmmaking process itself ��� staging Mr. Wist�۪s testimony as a re-enactment; using a whirring projector to divide reels; freezing again and again on Nazi cameramen inadvertently trapped in their own fabrications ��� Ms. Hersonski blatantly emphasizes the hand behind the celluloid curtain.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the director�۪s decision to invite five survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto to view the original footage and to film their reactions." an unfinished Nazi propaganda film of the Warsaw Ghetto simply titled ���Das Ghetto�۝ and discovered by East German archivists after the war was used by scholars and historians as a flawed but authentic record of ghetto life. Shot over 30 days in May 1942 ��� just two months before deportations to the Treblinka extermination camp would begin ��� this hourlong silent film juxtaposed random scenes of Jews enjoying various luxuries with images of profound suffering." mysterious and intellectually provocative ���A Film Unfinished�۝  positions familiar Holocaust horrors (the R rating was unsuccessfully contested) within a philosophical commentary on the way we view images.

In the case of the band that�۪s almost true since their frontman in a tormentedly unshaven Mark Webber their drummer is an adorably scowly Alison Pill and their caterwauling power-pop numbers were composed by Beck Hansen.

Another is Scott�۪s sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick) who offers him not-so-patient advice on his girl troubles which seem to be legion.

The pairing of an anxious diffident loser with a woman who is miles out of his league is beyond a clich̩ at this point and making the situation seem fresh is a task that falls on Ms. Winstead as much as on Mr. Cera. And somehow they make it work in part because Ramona never lets go of her skepticism even as she warms to Scott and in part because Scott is never the abject weakling he often wants everyone to believe he is. His quivery diffidence contains quite a bit of guile and what we know of his romantic history suggests a wolf in wet noodle�۪s clothing.

At the end the movie comes home to the well-known territory of the coming-of-age story with an account of lessons learned and conflicts resolved. But you�۪ll swear you�۪ve never seen anything like it before." on the other hand poses a mortal danger to Scott. One of her exes (it turns out to be Jason Schwartzman amusingly cast as the designated older guy) has organized the others going back to grade school into a league and Scott must do battle with each one in turn. The fights are as much like musical numbers as standard action sequences and they give Mr. Wright the chance to expand the kinetic visual wit that made his earlier genre spoofs ��� ���Shaun of the Dead�۝ and ���Hot Fuzz�۝��� such crazy fun." though I have high hopes for ���Tron: Legacy.�۝ Most films that try to exploit the popularity of gaming mimic the look and mood of state-of-the-art first-person games rather than the cruder more cartoony ones evoked here. But Mr. Wright�۪s deeper ingenuity (and Mr. O�۪Malley�۪s) is to collapse the distance between gamer and avatar not by throwing the player into the world of the game but rather by bringing it to him. (If you want to reverse this process there is now a Scott Pilgrim video game.) As a result the line between fantasy and reality is not so much blurred as erased because the filmmakers create an entirely coherent perpetually surprising universe that builds on Mr. O�۪Malley�۪s bold and unpretentious graphic style without slavishly duplicating it."

Ms. Roberts dims her glamour without snuffing it out altogether as she tried to do in Mike Nichols�۪s unfortunate ���Closer.�۝ Her Liz Gilbert can be radiant and witty and rarely doubts her essential attractiveness but she also suffers uncertainty ambivalence and real anguish. The end of her marriage ��� to a kind weak-willed oddball played by Billy Crudup ��� is wrenching before it has a chance to be fully liberating. And her rebound relationship with a soulful younger actor (James Franco) only exacerbates Liz�۪s sense that she is drifting away from herself." Liz�۪s trip is confined to countries that begin with the letter ���I.�۝ From the trattorias and ruins of Italy to an ashram in India and then to Indonesia. At the ashram she meets a cantankerous Texan named Richard (Richard Jenkins) whose nickname for her is Groceries and whom she accuses of ���speaking in bumper stickers.�۝ This is a stone tossed from inside a glass house given the aphoristic wisdom-mongering tone of much of ���Eat Pray Love �۝ but it is also a welcome wink of self-awareness indicative of the good humor that redeems some of the film�۪s (and the book�۪s) muzzy therapeutic moments. The three themes enumerated in the title are explored with a cheerful tact unlikely to trouble any tastes or sensibilities. The food is not overly spicy or exotic ��� spaghetti in Rome pizza in Naples; the religion not uncomfortably you know religious; and the sex discreet almost to the point of invisibility. In Bali Liz apprentices herself to an elderly shaman (the irrepressible scene stealer Hadi Subiyanto) and befriends a healer named Wayan (Christine Hakim). She also falls for Felipe a divorced Brazilian expatriate played with insouciant unshaven charm by Javier Bardem." early and late by its intrepid heroine. Its span may be global but its scope is modest and it accepts a certain superficiality as the price of useful insight. Watch. Smile. Go home and dream of Brazilians in Bali." and whether you approve of her choices and the expectations she has set for herself it is hard not to be impressed by her honesty. The same can be said for Ms. Gilbert (to distinguish between the author and narrator of the book and the character she becomes when impersonated by Ms. Roberts). And the screenwriters copiously sprinkling the author�۪s supple genial prose into dialogue and voice-over maintain a clear sense of her major theme. As the movie meanders through beautiful locations grazing on scenery flowers and food it keeps circling back to the essential tension between Liz�۪s longing for independence and her desire to be loved." while women are expected to pursue men. In a typical big-studio romantic comedy the heroine�۪s professional ambition may not always be an insurmountable obstacle to matrimony but her true fulfillment ��� not just her presumed happiness but also the completion of her identity ��� will come only at the altar." does that mean in the end that it reverts to the man-centric romantic-comedy formula? Yes and no. Mr. Murphy whose television work (���Nip/Tuck�۝ and ���Glee �۝ most notably) can be sharp-edged even to the point of meanness is much softer here and ���Eat Pray Love�۝ can serve as a reminder that television is at the moment a braver and more radical medium than the movies." she observes that for most of it she was either with a man or in the process of leaving one and so in the first stages of her journey she experiments with singleness. Not with solitude exactly since Liz is naturally gregarious and acquires friends easily. Back home in New York she has Delia (Viola Davis) and in Rome a Swedish woman named Sofi (Tuva Novotny) introduces her to an amicable group of Italians including a fellow whose last name is Spaghetti (Giuseppe Gandini). While he is seen mainly in group shots his namesake food is filmed in loving close-ups." but no blood or skin and just a bit of decorous swearing." and one that depends for both its articulation and its proposed solution on a high degree of material security and social entitlement. So many people in this world confront much graver threats to their well-being: violence poverty oppression. This woman has nothing but good luck! True enough but the kind of class consciousness that would blame Liz for feeling bad about her life and then taking a year abroad to cure what ails her strikes me as a bit disingenuous ��� a way of trivializing her trouble on the grounds of gender without having to come out and say so."

A bit later Shmulik masters his terror and fires a shell into another vehicle blowing up what appears to be an innocent chicken farmer." rounded-off perspective of the frames and the occasional absence of sound makes it seem as if Shmulik were watching an especially lurid and violent silent film.

To keep the story hopping along there is intermittent gunplay a kidnapping and a lot of swaggering tough-guy talk." and wondered how exactly it came to be then you might be curious about ���Middle Men �۝ a new movie about the discreet online use of credit cards directed by George Gallo." ���Middle Men�۝ bears some telltale scars of hasty clumsy truncation. Still there is a raffish vigor that makes the movie watchable despite all-over-the-map storytelling and a fuzzy superficial grasp of the salient themes. We know early on that we are in the presence of a bit of a mess as the opening minutes unspool a zigzagging chronology ��� 10 years earlier 6 months later 5 years before that; Houston Los Angeles Las Vegas somewhere else ��� accompanied by some grandstanding prose uttered by Jack Harris (Luke Wilson) about the modern history of male masturbation and his own decisive place within it." where he meets up with Buck (Gabriel Macht) and Wayne (Giovanni Ribisi) a pair of coked-out cretins who happen to stumble into one of the very few surefire long-term moneymakers of the 1990s Internet boom.

Both of these are fascinating subjects that have largely eluded mainstream filmmaking. Paul Thomas Anderson�۪s ���Boogie Nights�۝ is a partial exception and ���The Social Network �۝ David Fincher�۪s coming movie about the beginnings of Facebook may prove to be another. Mr. Gallo for his part is content to decorate a fairly conventional intermittently entertaining crime chronicle with a bit of skin and a soup̤on of pop sociology. There must be other ways to learn about pornography on the Internet." you can settle in for a moderately enjoyable reasonably stylish chronicle of vice.

In the late 1930s a man from East Tennessee named Felix Breazeale decided to give himself a funeral before he was even dead. It was by all accounts a lively affair with musical entertainment and a raffle to attract the public and it left behind a vapor trail of mystery. Who was this character? What was he thinking?" sign posts appear pointing in a familiar direction: toward the revelation and redemption of a long-buried tragedy. Felix we suspect will at last be explained accepted and absolved. When this happens it is something of a letdown but that is partly because the film is for the most part so richly and comfortably human that it hardly needs the melodramatic amplification of its end." which is forgivable since its answer to the first question is Robert Duvall. This means that though the story sometimes wanders into hazy corny sentiment its protagonist (called Felix Bush which was apparently a nickname or alias of Breazeale�۪s) is vivid enigmatic and unpredictable. Mr. Duvall now 79 has recently specialized in small indelible character parts: the police department patriarch in ���We Own the Night�۝; the blind survivor speaking in apocalyptic riddles in ���The Road�۝; the sobered-up bar owner helping Jeff Bridges�۪s Bad Blake through ���Crazy Heart.�۝" based on a story by Mr. Provenzano and Scott Seeke; director of photography David Boyd; music by Jan A.

Wearing what look like prosthetic teeth purchased from Ye Olde Peter Sellers Gagge Shoppe Mr. Carell plays a man so utterly clueless about the impression he makes on the world that next to him Michael Scott from ���The Office�۝ looks like George Clooney.

�۝ Todd Solondz�۪s sort-of sequel to his 1998 film ���Happiness �۝ seems to pose this question pitching the viewer into a queasy limbo between mirth and anguish. The characters are almost uniformly miserable ��� the one named Joy perhaps most of all ��� and whatever joy they do encounter is likely to be short-lived. And yet the painful conversations that make up the bulk of the film�۪s action are structured like mordant jokes. These people are so clueless so bad at communication so ridiculous that they must be suffering for our amusement." and allows everyone a chance to be earnestly foolish unguardedly selfish and also almost by accident cruelly honest. The actors handle the awkwardness beautifully each finding a way to make Mr. Solondz�۪s meticulous slightly mannered dialogue sound like natural speech.

How did Dylan Baker turn into Ciaran Hinds?"

Mr. Solondz�۪s view of modern American humanity from ���Welcome to the Dollhouse �۝ through ���Happiness�۝ and ���Storytelling�۝ and ���Palindromes �۝ has never really changed though it has yielded uneven results. He is unsparing in his attack on the complacencies of the suburban upper-middle class but to describe his attitude as cruel or contemptuous is to miss the compassion and the almost rabbinical ethical seriousness that drives his inquiries. And to take a movie like ���Life During Wartime�۝ as satire is to simplify its intentions and effects. Mr. Solondz exaggerates in the direction of mockery yes but his lurid colors emphatic musical effects and dead-center framing also betray a commitment to melodrama that can only be sincere." Mr. Solondz has changed the cast entirely and allowed the characters to age at different rates so that the events of ���Happiness�۝ occupy different phases of each one�۪s past.

Allen (originally played with indelible creepiness by Philip Seymour Hoffman) has tried to mend his perverted ways with Joy�۪s help." and it is Timmy tumbling out of innocence who grasps the link between his broken family and the dysfunctional republic for which they stand. He has the last word in the movie a fitting and troubling epitaph for the first decade of the 21st century and the most complex and resonant punch line Mr. Solondz has yet produced: ���I don�۪t care about freedom and democracy.

�۝ there is nothing that counts as genuine vision.

The unconscious as Freud (and Hitchcock and a lot of other great filmmakers) knew is a supremely unruly place a maze of inadmissible desires scrambled secrets jokes and fears. If Mr. Nolan can�۪t quite reach this place that may be because his access is blocked by the very medium he deploys with such skill." Cobb and his team are trying to induce a young man (Cillian Murphy) whose father (Pete Postlethwaite) is a business rival of Saito�۪s to break up the company he is about to inherit. This bit of commercial intrigue provides the fairly banal material foundation on which Mr. Nolan�۪s phantasmagorical world is built. The pursuit of competitive advantage by well-dressed emotionless men is hardly the stuff that dreams are made of Humphrey Bogart�۪s observations at the end of  ���The Maltese Falcon�۝ notwithstanding." her most famous movie role evoked by occasional eruptions of ��dith Piaf on the  ���La Vie en Rose�۝ soundtrack is the film�۪s principal enigma and its chief signifier of emotion. She is not however exactly a character in ���Inception.�۝ Rather at least as far as a first-time viewer can guess she is a projection in the subconscious of her husband a specialist in corporate mental espionage known as Cobb and played by Leonardo DiCaprio with some of the same twitchy melancholy he brought to  ���Shutter Island.�۝" but also of his chosen art form at this moment in its history. Our dreams feed the movies. The movies feed our dreams. But somehow our imaginations are still hungry." more often than not these days are made out of other movies.  ���Inception �۝ Christopher Nolan�۪s visually arresting noir-tinged caper is as packed with allusions and citations as a film studies term paper.  Admirers of Ridley Scott�۪s  ���Blade Runner�۝ and Stanley Kubrick�۪s ���2001�۝ will find themselves in good company though ���Inception�۝ does not come close to matching the impact of those durable cult objects. It trades in crafty puzzles rather than profound mysteries and gestures in the direction of mighty philosophical questions that Mr. Nolan is finally too tactful too timid or perhaps just too busy to engage." which is faint praise only if you insist on expecting something more from commercial entertainment. That audiences do ��� and should ��� expect more is partly I suspect what has inspired some of the feverish early notices hailing ���Inception�۝ as a masterpiece just as the desire for a certifiably great superhero movie led to the wild overrating of  ���The Dark Knight.�۝ In both cases Mr. Nolan�۪s virtuosity as a conjurer of brilliant scenes and stunning set pieces along with his ability to invest grandeur and novelty into conventional themes have fostered the illusion that he is some kind of visionary." �۝ cinema seemed to replicate the uncanny image-making power of the mind much as still photography had in the decades before. And over the course of the 20th century cinema provided a vast perpetually replenishing reservoir of raw material for the  fantasies of millions of people. Freud believed that dreams were compounded out of the primal matter of the unconscious and the prosaic events of daily life. If he were writing now he would have to acknowledge that they are also for many of us made out of movies." something to be mused over rather than analyzed something you may forget as soon as it�۪s over. Which is to say that the time ��� nearly two and a half hours ��� passes quickly and for the most part pleasantly and that you see some things that are pretty amazing and amazingly pretty: cities that fold in on themselves like pulsing three-dimensional maps; chases and fights that defy the laws that usually govern space time and motion; Marion Cotillard�۪s face." once Cobb and company have dropped into their mark�۪s sleeping mind is often curiously pedestrian. Most of the time one group of guys with guns chases another in cars across the rain-soaked streets of Los Angeles on foot through the corridors of a retro-elegant hotel and on skis and snowmobiles through an icy Alpine landscape from which James Bond might recently have departed." and putting the rest of them at a vaguely defined but serious risk ��� a graver danger than just waking up. (The conceit that they�۪re all dreaming takes some of the edge off the movie�۪s violence since it�۪s hard to grieve for extras who are just ���projections�۝ in some else�۪s mental theater.

their labors ultimately serve to emphasize the grinding mediocrity of the enterprise. The method of ���The Sorcerer�۪s Apprentice�۝ is to string together pedestrian moments of explanation comedy and emotion around noisy and derivative action sequences some of which seem to go against the very premise of the movie. Why would Balthazar and Maxim ��� magicians who can fly change shape and conjure force fields fireballs and just about anything else they want ��� need to climb into cars and chase each other through the streets of New York?" though that ���The Sorcerer�۪s Apprentice�۝ does have a distinguished cultural pedigree reaching back to Goethe�۪s poem which inspired Paul Dukas�۪s orchestral composition which in turn provided the music for perhaps the most memorable segment of Walt Disney�۪s ���Fantasia.�۝ Mr. Turteltaub does pay homage to that wonderful scene in which Mickey Mouse tries to use his half-learned powers to do his chores but the sight of Mr. Baruchel trying to bring rampaging mops under control can only suffer in comparison.

But still. It�۪s stupid. At several points Balthazar intones that the fate of mankind hangs in the balance. But it never feels as if more were at stake than the bottom line of Jerry Bruckheimer Films and the Walt Disney Company who seem to have confected this lumbering amusement in the hopes of picking up a little Harry Potter cash in the interval between ���The Half-Blood Prince�۝ and ���The Deathly Hallows.�۝" if you are not a Monica Bellucci completist is that the rival sorcerers are played by Alfred Molina and Nicolas Cage. Mr. Molina who was perhaps a bit too sensitive as Doc Ock in ���Spiderman 2 �۝ attacks his villainous role Maxim with mustache-twirling relish. As Balthazar Mr. Cage having worked with the director Jon Turteltaub on the popular ���National Treasure�۝ series refines the oddball intensity he brought to those pictures and mixes in new flavors of wackiness. If he has not quite approached a Christopher Walken level of sublime self-parody Mr. Cage has at least established himself as the heir to Al Pacino in the crazy mentor pantheon." though Dave has learned that he is the Prime Merlinian which means that ���The Sorcerer�۪s Apprentice�۝ is not just another dweeb/cutie romantic comedy but also a phantasmagorical action picture in which bolts of lightning will shoot out of people�۪s hands and ancient spells will be uttered to cataclysmic effect right on the streets of Manhattan. To spare you the full rehash: hundreds of years ago a bunch of bad wizards were stuffed into a Russian doll including the really mean Morgana (Alice Krige) and the gorgeous Veronica (Monica Bellucci).

Movies like ���The Road to Guant��namo�۝ and ���In This World�۝ blur the line between fiction and documentary reconstructing true stories with nonprofessional actors in real locations. ���Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story�۝  pretends to be a movie about the failed making of a movie while ���9 Songs�۝ is technically if not quite in spirit a work of hard-core pornography." unhinged pseudo-memoir.

But while the filmmakers succeed in evoking the queasy lurid ambiance of Thompson�۪s hothouse world they can�۪t quite figure out how to duplicate his remorseless storytelling skill.

This background may or may not explain Lou�۪s descent into criminality ��� the murders he commits can be interpreted as part of a long-gestating plan of revenge ��� but it is explored in such a lumbering incoherent way that the film becomes blurry and distracted just when it should be gathering momentum and force." at least in Michael Winterbottom�۪s nasty and uneven adaptation of Jim Thompson�۪s surpassingly mean little crime novel where traditional courtesies coexist uneasily with the energy and corruption of the 1950s oil boom. (The film is set in 1958 six years after the book�۪s publication perhaps to avoid anachronism in the musical selections). Not that Lou played by Casey Affleck is a symbol of economic progress or social disorder. As conceived by Thompson and embodied by Mr. Affleck (Stacy Keach played the character in an earlier film version) Lou is something much sicker and more interesting." Mr. Affleck registers a hint of panicky uncertainty. And when he is perpetrating the unflinchingly filmed acts of violence that have already made this movie somewhat controversial he seems almost as vulnerable as his victims. You may feel a twinge of sympathy for this monster a strange and vivid character who deserves all the torments of hell and also a better movie."

Despite their indie cred the Duplasses are mainstream hence the movie�۪s status quo finish. ���Cyrus�۝ is more finely tuned than their earlier movies (���The Puffy Chair �۝ ���Baghead�۝) but it shares a similar almost aggressive lack of ambition. John doesn�۪t work hard and neither do the Duplasses who don�۪t want their audiences to break a sweat either.

They meet at a party soon after the movie opens when she catches him drunk urinating on the host�۪s yard. She finds this charming an inexplicable reaction for a woman who appears sober sane and not obviously desperate enough to jump at the first sight of an unzipped member.

Like the other characters John is a rough sketch and not an especially appealing one but Mr. Reilly and the filmmakers get a lot of mileage out of the actor�۪s talent for making genially hapless characters likable. John doesn�۪t have much going for him and in a way he�۪s more of a blank than Cyrus without any obvious driving passions beyond Molly and his own loneliness.

(She�۪s also good friends with Ms. Stern�۪s mother.) The filmmakers kept after her as she moved from airplanes to hotel lobbies dressing rooms and onto the stage where her cavernously wide mouth pours out invective acid asides and jokes jokes jokes like water." the filmmakers don�۪t try to make her look good and while they omit some of her uglier routines they don�۪t (perhaps can�۪t) ask you to love her. That�۪s a wise move. Ms. Rivers may be a comic genius but she�۪s easier to admire from the distance of a movie seat and perhaps across the passage of time. An equal-opportunity offender she has taken plenty of people down on her way up including other women. Watching some of her nastier ���Tonight Show�۝ spots (which aren�۪t in the movie) I find it hard to decide if her pokes at Elizabeth Taylor�۪s weight are more painful than her self-lacerating jibes. Picking on Ms. Taylor was unspeakably mean. But Ms. Rivers�۪s contempt for herself lasted longer: a lifetime or so it seems." the filmmakers take on Ms. Rivers�۪s own looks from the start opening the movie with shots of her bare face ��� a shut naked eye a thin line of mouth ��� as someone else greases it with makeup. It�۪s only after she�۪s put on this face that all these pieces come together in startling close-up. It�۪s a nice metaphor for the effort it takes to assemble the product known as Joan Rivers but the bluntness of the images and her gaze are disconcerting. Is she daring us to look or begging? It�۪s hard to know and the filmmakers who resist putting her on the couch aren�۪t saying. In the end all you really know is that when she stands on the stage it�۪s as if she had tapped right into her id. It�۪s a gusher." when it�۪s not appalling." because Ms. Rivers who with her daughter Melissa starred in a television movie about her husband�۪s death seems to have few boundaries. It isn�۪t that she overshares on an obvious level ��� there are many biographical details that never even come up ��� it�۪s that no other ���Joan �۝ no private self seems to be lurking beneath the mask. Given the single-mindedness with which she pursues her career ��� Melissa Rivers likens that career to a second child ��� you have to wonder how any other Joan could have survived. It�۪s no wonder that when Joan Rivers asks a radio host ���Who is the real me?�۝ it feels like an honest question." whose documentaries include  ���The Devil Came on Horseback �۝ about the atrocities in Darfur and ���The Trials of Darryl Hunt �۝  about a wrongly convicted African American prisoner. However improbable the match-up works partly because the filmmakers don�۪t approach her as either an entertainment industry untouchable or one of its casualties. They�۪re sympathetic to her but a touch cool and certainly not fawning which underscores their status as entertainment industry outsiders. This is just a look at a native in her natural habitat sequins and feathered boas included." at least is what I thought after watching (twice) the documentary ���Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work.�۝  Directed by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg this convulsively funny movie takes an up-close and sometimes queasy-personal approach to its motormouth subject who when she�۪s not making you howl with laughter (or freeze up in horror) brandishes her deeply held hurts fears prejudices poor judgment and bad taste as if they were stigmata."

You don�۪t have to be familiar with the first ���Karate Kid�۝ �� or even with the trailer for this one �� to know what will happen. There will be rigorous training beginning with the repetition of a simple menial task in this case taking off and hanging up a jacket (rather than the car waxing in the first movie).

single-minded fervor by artists at the peak of their creativity. Although the movie visits Chanel�۪s workshop it devotes more time to the meticulous creation of her signature perfume Chanel No. 5." the relationship of Stravinsky and Chanel  mirrors the revolutionary spirit of ���The Rite of Spring �۝ as does Chanel�۪s preference for stark black-and-white. Like the dancers in ���The Rite of Spring �۝ spasmodically responding to seasonal cycles the lovers allow passion  to pre-empt propriety as they follow nature�۪s way. The sex scenes although moderately heated have none of the biting and clawing urgency of uncontrollable animal heat. Even in bed or on the piano bench on which Chanel straddles Stravinsky mind games are being played." at once grateful and resentful of Chanel�۪s hospitality drags Catherine and their four children to Chanel�۪s home where there are servants and a studio with a grand piano. During their affair conducted under the nose of Catherine the lovers make only token attempts to conceal their passion. When Catherine eventually confronts her hostess and asks if she feels any guilt Chanel bluntly replies no. Stravinsky is cagier. When asked if he has slept with Chanel there is a long pause and finally no reply." Catherine (Elena Morozova) speak Russian this mainly French-language film barely makes note of his Russian origins. Chanel�۪s past is left even vaguer. In her only vulnerable moments she is seen shedding tears over the recent death of her English boyfriend Boy Capel." the movie narrows its focus to the treacherous psychology of a relationship that begins when the already successful Chanel invites the still impecunious Stravinsky and his family to stay in her villa outside Paris. World War I perfunctorily dispensed with in an abrupt unsatisfying montage of old newsreels has already come and gone." with hooded eyes and a wary demeanor Mads Mikkelsen�۪s Stravinsky has music exploding in his head almost faster than he can transcribe it to the page. Anna Mouglalis�۪s Chanel with her imperious carriage deep voice and a hard gaze that could bore a hole into you suggests a mannish Ava Gardner on the rampage. To those who work at her fashion house she is an unremittingly severe taskmaster. You can understand the mutual fascination of these two each of whom is more than a little monstrous. Their biggest similarity both acknowledge is that the sources of their creativity are the vibrations of notes and the feel of fabric not ideas worked out on paper." Carlo de Boutiny and Mr. Kounen based on the novel ���Coco & Igor�۝ by Chris Greenhalgh; director of photography David Ungaro; edited by Anny Danch̩; original music by Gabriel Yared; production designer Marie-H̩l̬ne Sulmoni; costumes by Chattoune & Fab; produced by Claudie Ossard and Chris Bolzli; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

Their affair continues but its days are numbered." Stravinsky�۪s marriage has lost its bloom. Catherine suffers from tuberculosis and has a vision of herself as an animal rotting from the inside. But she has the advantage of being Stravinsky�۪s most trusted creative adviser. Ms. Morozova gives a subtle understated portrait of a betrayed wife sorrowfully making the best of an excruciating situation as she waits for the relationship to run its course." elegant and sexy with scrupulously detailed Art Deco design and shadowy lighting that lends many of the scenes a painterly depth. But the film  ���  adapted from Chris Greenhalgh�۪s novel with a screenplay written by the author  with the director and Carlo de Boutiny  ��� never regains that initial blast of energy and the final scenes wobble toward a wishy-washy ending." Jan Kounen�۪s ���Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky�۝ comes closer than most films to capturing the selfish competitive passion of egomaniacal geniuses locked in erotic combat." that began in 1920 seven years after she attended the world premiere of Stravinsky�۪s ���Rite of Spring.�۝ That notorious opening May 29 1913 at the Th̢̩tre des Champs-��lys̩es in Paris erupted into a riot as audience members outraged by Stravinsky�۪s dissonant harshly pulsing music and Vaslav Nijinsky�۪s primitive choreography angrily vented their disapproval. Fights broke out the police were called and Stravinsky sank into sulky despondence."

(Not that modern audiences don�۪t want semiserious as witnessed by the runaway success of the ���Bourne�۝ franchise.)" the obstacle that the director Joe Carnahan and his colleagues failed to clear was finding the right self-mocking tone for a movie that was by the looks of it too expensive to risk real laughs.

(Mr. Natali who wrote the script with Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor likes his allusions: Clive is most likely a homage to Colin Clive who played Dr. Frankenstein in James Whale�۪s ���Bride of Frankenstein �۝ with Elsa Lanchester as the memorably shocked betrothed.)" and it helps explain how ���Splice�۝ delivers for the horror movie fan who has grown weary of being suckered by films that promise new frights only to deliver the same old buckets of gore and guts. Ms. Polley and Mr. Brody play Clive and Elsa live-in lovers and rock-star bio-engineers (they�۪re on the cover of Wired) who are creating new organisms from the DNA of different animals.

Given their respective performative idiosyncrasies and as important their singularly nontraditional beauty the pair�۪s casting immediately signals that the director Vincenzo Natali is after something different. With Ms. Polley and Mr. Brody on board there�۪s a chance that despite the big-studio brands on the movie you�۪re not headed into genre purgatory with the usual disposable plastic people who often populate (and perish in) mainstream horror. When these two bleed you might actually care." one of its seven executive producers.  Mr. Natali whose earlier films include ���Cube �۝ hasn�۪t reinvented the horror genre. But with ���Splice�۝ he has done the next best thing with an intelligent movie that in between its small boos and an occasional hair-raising jolt explores chewy issues like bioethics abortion corporate-sponsored science commitment problems between lovers and even Freudian-worthy family dynamics. The shivers might often outweigh the scares and Mr. Natali loses his way in the last half-hour. Yet working with actors who make you care and a neo-Frankenstein creation that touchingly does too he has become one of the genre�۪s new great fright hopes." it�۪s fundamental to Mr. Natali�۪s design. Point-of-view shots don�۪t necessarily put you in a character�۪s (in this case metaphoric) shoes but because they let you see what a character sees allowing you to share his or her perspective they can create a sense of empathy for the character. In this case though empathy with Fred seems less the point than what it is we see through his eyes: Clive and Elsa fully masked and dressed in laboratory clothes working in the slightly sickly greenish light of a laboratory bought and paid for by a big company playing at God. This is the vision of Clive and Elsa that Mr. Natali wants you to remember despite all that comes next."

Though loosely structured around the criminal trials of Andre Rand convicted of kidnapping two of five children who disappeared on Staten Island between 1972 and 1987 the film is less a whodunit than a whythinkit. Was Mr. Rand who is still in prison really guilty or simply a convenient receptacle for the ingrained terrors of a powerful urban legend?" the disturbing footage of tormented and filthy inmates scuttling on dank floors like blind animals serves a different purpose: as a gut-churning glimpse into abuses that Mr. Rand presumably witnessed every day." homey interviews (moving and sometimes baffling) and amateur sleuthing (cheerfully random) ���Cropsey�۝ shines an uncomfortable light on the way we reason. Its straggling true-crime narrative leaping hither and yon like a dog chasing butterflies is not what holds the film together; the real glue is the emergence of a parallel between location and suspect between literal dumping ground and figurative.

It does not take much to evoke the atmosphere of cold war paranoia that thickened anew in the years between the Sputnik launching and the Cuban missile crisis and the archive of collective memory from which Mr. Grimonprez gleans his video feels pretty picked over at this point. Connections between Hitchcock�۪s films and to list a few examples Nikita S. Khrushchev Richard M. Nixon Fidel Castro and John F. Kennedy are made without any particular analytical insight. The birds and the bombs and the swell new color television consoles were all equally signs of the times." based on a story by Tom McCarthy inspired by the essay ���August 25 1983�۝ by Jorge Luis Borges; directors of photography Hans Buyse and Martin Testar; edited by Dieter Diependaele and Tyler Hubby; music by Christian Halten; produced by Emmy Oost; released by Kino International.

Initially it�۪s all we can do to keep pace  with him as he races from foe to friend trying to appease a difficult director in Sweden who is the presumed proxy for the Danish Mr. von Trier (���He�۪s a psychopath �۝ someone says) and joking with a husky diminutive French filmmaker who appears to be a stand-in for Ms. Denis." a story about the agonies of trying to work outside the cinematic mainstream (even in France!). Yet what makes the movie so affecting is that it�۪s also a love story about a family. Throughout the film acquaintances and advisers urge Gr̩goire to sell his film catalog to save his company. He refuses insisting that if he does there will be nothing left. Of course he�۪s wrong as Ms. Hansen-Love�۪s repeated and heartfelt images of his daughters and wife forcefully insist. For the film�۪s first hour Gr̩goire who�۪s made expressively   real by Mr. de Lencquesaing�۪s understated magnetism fills the story with excitement.

This is a good thing since most movies plop down in easily recognizable categories and stay there troubling neither their own intellectual inertia nor that of the audience." but what�۪s wrong with that? The skeptical and the secular also need stories of martyrdom and rousing acts of cinematic preaching." when the Christians are in the ascendancy and many of the pagans have converted the Christians and the Jews start killing one another. Orestes now a Christian serves the Roman Empire in a position of authority while Synesius has become a bishop and Davus radicalized by earlier bloodshed has become a member of a black-robed Christian militia called the Parabolani led by a former street preacher named Ammonius (Ashraf  Barhom) who enforce their uncompromising notions of morality with clubs knives and stones." which is only partly about the lovelorn students and their lovely instructor. Hypatia doted on by her father Theon (Michael Lonsdale) is not only indifferent to male desire but to the consequences of the crisis that is threatening the peace of her city. Alexandria�۪s pagan aristocracy to which Hypatia belongs is challenged by a rebellious and increasingly militant Christian population with the city�۪s Jews caught in the middle and its class divisions exacerbated by religious tension. In the midst of intense sectarian conflict Hypatia persists in trying centuries before Kepler and Galileo to understand the laws that govern the motions of the planets." a humanist and an intellectual finds herself threatened from all sides. And though her predicament is sometimes laid out in heavy thematic speeches it is also very moving. This is partly because Ms. Weisz is such a sympathetic presence and adept at showing how her character�۪s combination of wisdom and unworldliness makes her vulnerable to the guile cowardice and opportunism of others. But it is also because Mr. Amen��bar and Mr. Gil  do not stack the odds in her favor. Films about ideological strife in the past frequently reassure modern audiences with a vision of progress in which ignorance is at least partly vanquished and enlightenment is allowed to prevail." �۝ bristling with ideas and topical provocations unfolds in a world of togas sandals and high-flown language a setting that might lead you to expect camp classicism or ���Gladiator.�۝ What you get at least in the early scenes is the story of three young men with a crush on their science teacher. Her name is Hypatia she is a noblewoman in the Egyptian city of Alexandria ��� it�۪s the fourth century A.D. by the way ��� and since she is played by Rachel Weisz you can hardly blame them.

Whoever is in power tries to preserve it by fair means or foul and whoever wants power uses brutality to acquire it. So in the first half of the film the insurgent Christian mob draws pagan blood and the beleaguered pagan elite including  Theon and Orestes meets the threat with savagery." but I will say that ���Agora�۝ treats this kind of wishful thinking with a skepticism that makes the film not only sad but also chilling. It is entirely ��� not dogmatically but stubbornly ��� on the side of reason science and liberalism values opposed by superstition fundamentalism and political expediency. The world of Alexandria in the later years of the Roman Empire is one in which the forces of intolerance whatever deity they profess always seem to have the upper hand and in which even ostensibly rational compassionate rulers collaborate with the faith-based holy warriors."

Dastan hooks up with a pouty princess (an unfortunate Gemma Arterton) and engages in some funny business with a shady wise-cracking sheik (Alfred Molina fortunately). Ben Kingsley shows up  as Basil Rathbone or rather Nizam the king�۪s silky suspicious  brother. Shot in Morocco and in Pinewood Studios in Britain the film is crammed with swirling sand milling crowds computer-generated cities and assorted narrative bits and pieces some borrowed from the studio playbook (everyone speaks in a British accent even alas Mr. Gyllenhaal) others recycled from the video game series by Jordan Mechner who has a story credit." and now Hollywood has swooped in to finish the job: one day after the ���Sex and the City�۝ ladies landed in the Abu Dhabi doo-doo setting off a dust storm of critical hate ���Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time�۝ seems primed to raise huffy hackles with a swords-and-sandals-style spectacular in ancient Iran. Based on a gulf-war-era video game ���Prince of Persia�۝ stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the titular warrior who scrambling up walls and vaulting across roofs amid camels pomegranates and whirling dervishes helps lead the search in wartime for Praise Bruckheimer weapons of not-quite-mass destruction." as does the sight of Mr. Molina planting a kiss on an ostrich in a big-screen spectacle that�۪s as much indebted to newfangled technologies as to old-fashioned Hollywood narrative strategies. If nothing else it�۪s entertaining to think about how this mash-up of ancient Persian heroics and headline news might sit with the Iranian powers that be. In March 2009 a spokesman for the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad demanded an apology from Hollywood for ���insults and accusations against the Iranian nation�۝ over the last 30 years. Clearly they had no idea they were about to be Bruckheimer-ed." which sharply zig and zag as if created by algorithms. Considering that he made the move from the art house to the blockbuster a few years ago with ���Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire �۝ Mr. Newell surely knew what he was getting himself into when he signed on with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Save for Michael Bay who parted company with Mr. Bruckheimer a while ago no director ever gets to put his own fingerprints on a Bruckheimer production. As usual the talent in ���Prince of Persia�۝ is generally top notch ��� from the cinematographer John Seale to the parkour expert David Belle ��� but the ingredients have been masticated so heavily the results are mush." his pumped-up pectorals flashing Mr. Gyllenhaal offers an updated spin on the mysterious Oriental lover of cinematic yesteryear. More butch than the silent-screen god Valentino (best known for playing the Sheik an Arab rather than a Persian heartbreaker) Mr. Gyllenhaal instead follows ��� and runs and leaps ��� in the robustly muscular and acrobatic tradition of Douglas Fairbanks the silent-film star whose Middle Eastern exploits were aggressively masculine. Granted the resurrection of a sexpot Middle Eastern hero (even one played by a non-Persian actor) might not seem like progress. But given the strained relations between the United States and Iran it�۪s a representation worth noting particularly since Dastan�۪s worth is finally measured by his more peaceable actions."

The more minutely the film analyzes Picasso�۪s paintings the further it drifts from its subject." it tries to show how Cubism founded by Picasso and Braque in 1907 supposedly translated the movies�۪ revolutionary portrayal of time space and motion into fine art. Photography had already captured moments that might have eluded the eye. The movies enabled visual artists to freeze blocks of time and analyze them at varying speeds. In consciously anatomizing motion and adopting multiple perspectives the documentary implies the Cubists may even have been trying to co-opt the brash new art form."

There are cellphones and online videos in his world but it nonetheless feels charmingly anachronistic as if the digital universe had been invaded by time travelers from a planet of pre-World War II French movies and music-hall acts. The use of soundtrack music by Max Steiner one of the great composers of old Hollywood underscores this out-of-time quality." but Bazil traces the mine and the bullet to rival armaments companies whose offices sit across from each other in an industrial zone on the fringe of Paris and whose chief executives are contrasting studies in corporate arrogance." since the film�۪s mood and message could hardly be more wholesome and its message will resonate most strongly with thoughtful 12-year-olds.

But its goals are so modest so tiny so timid that fulfillment is exactly what it does not provide.

I�۪ll bet that tastes good. Isn�۪t that fellow handsome? Doesn�۪t that old lady look sad? A wedding how nice!" ���Letters to Juliet�۝ is content to provide touristic evidence that Italy exists: hillsides bathed in golden light; steep and stony little towns; tile roofs and gently sloping vineyards. The human scenery suggests that time stopped sometime after Shakespeare but long before Berlusconi and that Italy�۪s authentic cultural role is as a colorful background for Anglophone romance." and it along with the romantic weepie ���Dear John �۝ is likely to consolidate her position as a certified movie star. And while she has yet to perform a feat of bravura big-screen acting (her best work is still on the HBO series ���Big Love�۝) her combination of stubbornness vulnerability and practical good sense makes her appealing to just about any imaginable audience. She is to the verge of tears what Kristen Stewart is to the bitten lip: a virtuoso of barely restrained and tantalizingly ambiguous emotion." the old lady ��� her name is Claire and she�۪s played by the effortlessly marvelous Vanessa Redgrave ��� looks amused baffled occasionally stricken and in general blithely indulgent toward the slick artificial story unfolding around her. Claire who alights in Verona in search of a long-lost love does not have much to do or say but Ms. Redgrave cooing and sighing and exchanging knowing looks with Ms. Seyfried imparts grace authenticity and a sense of emotional gravity to a movie desperate for all of those things and unsure just how to manufacture them."

And the plot of ���Iron Man 2�۝ is frankly a bit of a hash as Stark�۪s two-front conflict with Hammer and Vanko competes with exposition that will only pay off (meagerly I suspect) in later sequels."

Its grain of truthfulness however is just enough to leave you unsettled in the pit of your stomach." ���Happiness Runs �۝ may not be as depraved as the members of the Manson family. But these teenagers who were home-schooled in a climate drenched in sex and drugs are a creepy lot. While the 40- and 50-something parents are fornicating and practicing new-age rituals their aimless offspring spend their days drinking smoking and dealing pot ingesting any pharmaceutical they can get their hands on and having sex." Victor (Mark L. Young) is a meek lost soul who longs to leave the commune but whose mother (a gaunt ashen Andie MacDowell) refuses to give him the money. His insane father (Mark Boone Junior) addresses his son in poetic terms like ���Whither comest thee?�۝ and leeringly boasts of sleeping with a different woman every night." Becky (Hanna Hall) is shown with blood dripping down her arms and soft-core scenes that ogle her naked body in various states of ecstasy (she belongs to everybody she declares) ���Happiness Runs�۝ has the look and tone of an erotic horror film. In its ugliest moment these stoned children of the damned dressed for a costume party visit a nearby farm to play a game they call ���cow tipping.�۝ One overzealous member of their group gleefully douses a cow with gasoline and sets it on fire; the camera doesn�۪t show the blaze but we hear the agonized roars of the animal."

Their turf much like Chicago itself is tough and passionate: a trading floor fast vanishing under their feet." �۝ a documentary about the changing face of the Chicago futures exchanges. Open-outcry trading ��� the practice of calling out buy and sell orders in soybeans and pork bellies from the floor (the pit) ��� has declined like print media a victim of computer culture and the urgent hunger for instant new information. As electronic trading spreads and traders work in front of lifeless antiseptic monitors a generation of outcry traders finds itself increasingly obsolete.
