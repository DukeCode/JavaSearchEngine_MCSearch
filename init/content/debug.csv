Everyone has his or her memories of Diane Polley, but most adhere to the communally accepted facts of her life. What matters to Ms. Polley is how each person organizes those memories, with love, humor, regret, self-interest or, in the case of Michael Polley, a sometimes wincing mix of emotional detachment and lacerating humor. To watch Ms. Polley „ her face drained of readable emotion and her body vibrating, as if from unarticulated anxiety „ as she watches Michael talk about Diane and their life together is unexpectedly moving. Not all of these stories are easy. Yet, unlike those filmmakers who explore their family histories to settle scores or indulge in self-mythology, Sarah Polley knows that it is never all about her."
