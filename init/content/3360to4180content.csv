There she discovers Sadie (Besedka Johnson), an octogenarian who, partly locked away by old age and what comes increasingly to feel like unspoken sorrow, seems every bit as isolated as Jane.

The acuity of his visual style is complemented by his sensitive work with his actresses, whose unforced performances deepen the movieâ€™s emotional realism. A model, Ms. Hemingway (her mother is Mariel Hemingway) has appeared in only a few films and is a spectacular find, as is Ms. Johnson, a longtime Angeleno making a true, piercing screen debut."

Jane makes a living in front of a camera, though itâ€™s a while before you learn how, and itâ€™s easy to imagine that Sadie, with her heavy eyeliner and topknot, once wanted her shot at stardom. The patina of tawdry glamour that clings to this movie is, however, something of a diversion and also the point. When Jane first meets Sadie, the old woman is outside her house, obscured by overgrown foliage and the worldâ€™s indifference. Sheâ€™s as forgotten as the junk sheâ€™s trying to sell and blissfully, stirringly, unaware that she is about to be discovered."

In 1963 Orson Welles, who knew of the burdens of fame, said that Barrymoreâ€™s Hamlet was the greatest he had seen, characterizing it as â€œa man of genius who happened to be a princeâ€ù and was â€œtender and virile and witty and dangerous.â€ù The movies, alas, only gave us a screen test for that Hamlet."

His older brother, Lionel, was the first to make the leap from stage to screen, and John and their sister, Ethel, soon followed. It took John a while to find his way in movies, and one of his earliest successes is the 1920 version of â€œDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,â€ù for which he metamorphosed from man to monster with minimal makeup, a threatening chin and crazy eyes. Films like â€œGrand Hotel,â€ù â€œDinner at Eightâ€ù and â€œTwentieth Centuryâ€ù followed."

That wreckage is at center stage in â€œBarrymore,â€ù Ã‰rik Canuelâ€™s screen version of the William Luce play. The conceit of the drama that Christopher Plummer first performed at the Stratford Festival in Canada in 1996 â€” it moved to Broadway the next year â€” is an imagined Barrymore comeback. The time is 1942, right before his death, and he is struggling to stage â€œRichard III,â€ù his first Shakespearean triumph. He is a physical wreck, though he puts on a surprisingly good and vigorous show as, without an audience, he staggers about a stage delivering songs, limericks, innuendoes and reminiscences."

The words, drawn from his biography and some of his roles, are fine and even better when Shakespeare is the author. Mr. Plummer stumbles beautifully, poignantly and often, leering and searching through a haze of memory or, with concern edged with panic, calling for â€œa line, a lineâ€ù much as Richard III calls for a horse. From smile to sneer he captures Barrymoreâ€™s majesty and grandiloquence, recites his triumphs and humiliations. Now 82, he is possibly too old to play even a dissipated Barrymore, and the difference in age alters the playâ€™s meaning because it is age that has most obviously taken its toll."

Instead he leans heavily on medium close-ups, interspersing the kind of head-and-shoulder shots that are common on television with punctuating long shots of Barrymore portentously alone. The closer shots let you intimately scan Mr. Plummerâ€™s face, to watch the smiles bloom and fade and the cheeks tremble in rage, fear and regret. Occasionally a prompter, Frank (John Plumpis, who unwisely has been directed to shout his lines at the last row rather than Barrymore), tosses out a line or a reproach, and Mr. Canuel folds in archival footage or introduces a dreamlike glimpse of the outside world. This all adds little. The performance is the thing."

Thereâ€™s a no-nonsense, cut-to-the-chase quality to the opening scenes, which lay out the stakes and terrain. Shot in black and white, it begins with a man who, after a stroll through a Kafka-esque maze of filing cabinets, reads from a missing-persons report. Oshima â€” a salesman, 32, with a medium build, square face and caterpillar brows â€” was reported missing in April 1965, having disappeared, â€œmotive and cause unknown.â€ù The movie then jumps to a crowded street scene, and a male voice, presumably that of Imamura, asks, â€œWhere can anyone missing be in such a small country?â€ù"

The first revelation or crack in the case, as it were, comes from co-workers and relatives who explain that Oshima embezzled money from his company. Instead of firing him, his boss says, the company docked his pay. The film then takes a surprising turn when one of the apparent interviewers in the scene, a woman, Yoshie Hayakawa, explains that, having just dated Oshima briefly, she may have known only his good side. What, she asks the boss, is his opinion of Oshima? The answer (â€œtimid and gentleâ€ù) isnâ€™t critical, but the revelation that she is the missing manâ€™s fiancÃ©e is a jolt because it goes against the grain of documentary objectivity."

Because this is a documentary â€” isnâ€™t it? That at any rate seems to be the case to judge from the starkly beautiful hand-held cinematography, the naturalism of the interview subjects, the snatches of on-screen text and the escalating number of images of men holding movie cameras, tape recorders and microphones. All suggest that this is a slice of life. A scene of the second interviewer talking to the fiancÃ©e while they walk together side by side in long shot even brings to mind â€œChronicle of a Summer,â€ù the 1960 classic by Edgar Morin and Jean Rouch that introduced the term cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ© (truth cinema)."

As the search for Oshima extends to those who scarcely seem to know him â€” the location shifting from perfectly framed cramped interiors to dense city scenes and expansive country landscapes â€” â€œA Man Vanishesâ€ù kinks this way and that, growing knottier and more fascinating. Each interviewee has an (often unflattering) take on Oshimaâ€™s character, temperament, actions and motivations, yet the more he or she talks, the blurrier his portrait becomes, as anecdote leads to digression leads to a discourse on the Japanese character. In a dazzling, complicating stroke, Imamura also interviews people about some of the other interviewees."

Everyoneâ€™s picture of Oshima, including Imamuraâ€™s, proves conditional, often contradictory and finally as enigmatic as the photo of him that opens the film. Whether these representations come close to the truth of the man â€” much less that of those claiming to know him â€” haunts the film, as do questions of cinematic realism and how the camera changes everything. Years after Imamura made â€œA Man Vanishesâ€ù he said that he came away â€œfeeling that fiction â€” no matter how close to reality â€” could never be as truthful as unmediated documentary.â€ù Think about that observation when someone kicks down a wall in the film, destroying a set and a host of assumptions with it."

Aaron Taylor-Johnson, with curly blond hair, a crisp white uniform and the kind of mustache that would have melted hearts in an Upper West Side singles bar around 1974, turns Vronsky into a pretty, impulsive enigma.

Levin is widely understood to be Tolstoyâ€™s alter ego, and his idea of love â€” as the pure, ennobling union of souls â€” is an idealistic rebuke to the cynical amorality that festers in the cities.

Itâ€™s both comical and somewhat pitiful, but it also feels like an authorial declaration because it dovetails with Mr. Russellâ€™s belief in joyous, transporting cinema. Itâ€™s no wonder that Tiffany shows Pat a clip from â€œSinginâ€™ in the Rain,â€ù that blast of pure euphoria.

For years she was known only as the Central Park jogger, and her assailants were widely thought to be the five black and Latino teenagers, 14 to 16, who were arrested in the attack. The directors Ken Burns, David McMahon and Sarah Burns argue that the convictions, and the years the defendants served for the crime they were later absolved of, were a second, racially motivated crime."

In 2002 a New York State Supreme Court judge, Charles J. Tejada, after being presented with a confession and DNA evidence from a murderer and serial rapist, Matias Reyes, overturned the convictions of the men who became known as the Central Park Five. Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, Kharey Wise and Yusef Salaam had already served sentences of almost 7 to 13 years for the assault when they were exonerated.

Measured in tone and outraged in its argument, it is an emotionally stirring, at times crushingly depressing cinematic call to witness. Itâ€™s also frustrating because while it re-examines the assault on the jogger and painstakingly walks you through what happened to the teenagers â€” from their arrest through their absolution â€” it fails to add anything substantively new.

When she was found, the assumption was that she would die; instead she was comatose for several weeks. (When she woke, she had no memory of the attack.) As Ms. Burns writes in â€œThe Central Park Five,â€ù her 2011 book, the five teenagers had also been in the park that night, with a gang of about 30 kids who went after eight people, some violently. Each of the five said that he hadnâ€™t participated in the rampage, and yet, after they were arrested for attacking Ms. Meili, most confessed to assaulting her.

To that end the film sketches the New York of the 1980s as a battlefield, plagued by crime and reeling from the decimating shocks of a bad economy, AIDS, crack and racial explosions. Combatants, innocents and smaller battlegrounds flash by (Howard Beach, Bernhard H. Goetz) like the rapidly turned pages of a history book. The five teenagers were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were also the wrong color and the right suspects; the jogger was the perfect color and the right victim.

Because the one thing that it fails to do persuasively is explain why so many people in New York, including African-Americans and professional skeptics writing in left-leaning publications like The Village Voice, almost immediately accepted that the teenagers were guilty and believed the police, with whom these same skeptics had often been often politically at odds. As the filmmakers accurately depict, the teenagers were soon demonized and dehumanized, accused of being members of a â€œwolf packâ€ù that went â€œwildingâ€ù like animals. To judge from the documentary you might think that it was mostly the agenda-driven tabloids that lobbed these descriptions."

But Mr. Barrett emphasized what the police had or had not done the night of April 19, not what the teenagers might have done. In that same issue The Voice printed an investigation by Barry Michael Cooper that quoted residents of a housing complex across from Schomburg Plaza who identified several of the accused teenagers as belonging to a group of sometimes violent neighborhood troublemakers. Some of the accusations involved the usual kid stuff, like making noise, but there were also brutal attacks. A lengthy New York magazine cover article several months later also detailed violence."

The problem is that by ignoring it â€” as well as gliding rather too fast over the gang attacks on the other people in Central Park on April 19 â€” it seems as if there were something here that needs to be hidden. In 1989 if you read about the jogger case, you probably read about both these earlier park assaults and the ones around Schomburg Plaza. You knew that the unfolding story and New York were more complex than any tabloid headline. You knew life was shaped by race (as it always is), but also by class and by sex. And you also knew that the fears that gripped so many were not necessarily hysterical but grounded in lived, sometimes terrifying experience. That does not justify what happened, but it is part of why it happened."

It was also overwhelming, solid and seemingly incontrovertible in 2002, when the convictions were voided. According to news accounts it took Judge Tejada about five minutes to make his ruling. The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, disputed that Mr. Reyes acted alone; unsurprisingly the police and prosecutors donâ€™t appear in the movie. The next year the men once known as the Central Park wolf pack filed a lawsuit against New York, and the prosecutors and police who aided in the menâ€™s conviction when they were teenagers. The lawsuit, as the filmmakers remind us in the movieâ€™s final stretch, remains unresolved. The city in turn is trying to subpoena outtakes from the documentary to defend itself."

At the same time he is having trouble with his wife, Alma (a crisp, overglammed Helen Mirren), whoâ€™s grown grievously unhappy with his fixation on the blondes who populate his work. She finds some refuge in a relationship with a sycophantic screenwriter, Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), whose hovering attention contrasts sharply with Hitchcockâ€™s standoffishness.

The recent HBO exploitation flick, â€œThe Girl,â€ù for instance, about his relationship with the actress Tippi Hedren, painted him as a pathetic sexual predator. (Ms. Hedren has called him deviant and evil.) Although it tiptoes on the dark side, â€œHitchcockâ€ù takes a lighter, more strenuously comic if patronizing approach to the director. The movie has its diversions, including Scarlett Johanssonâ€™s bodacious Janet Leigh and Michael Stuhlbargâ€™s wheedling Lew Wasserman. Itâ€™s fluff.

So when Lachlan must confront a former spouse (Kathleen Wilhoite) and an all-but-estranged daughter (a very touching Savannah Lathem), Mr. Lewy neatly sidesteps the fissure of redemption. Rather than warm our hearts in conventional ways, this mellow drama simply proposes that when men screw up, the love of a good woman only goes so far."

The film opens with Mr. Banaâ€™s character, Addison, on the road and reminiscing in a soothing hush about childhood and a house in a valley. Heâ€™s talking to his sister, Liza (Olivia Wilde), and another man, the driver (Dennis Lafond), and while it sounds like a dream, his storytelling soon slips into a nightmarish key.

By the time the film ends the main characters â€” a web of disappointed parents and unhappy children â€” will have converged in a picturesquely situated farmhouse for one memorably bad Thanksgiving. Before then, though, the Austrian director Stefan Ruzowitzky, working from a script by Zach Dean and shooting in widescreen, splashes plenty of red on the white snow.

Mr. Ruzowitzky plays with the eerie beauty of the frozen landscape, filling the frame with the uncanny blue winter light and sometimes almost whiting out the image. He can be overly self-conscious in his choices, as when he films a snowmobile chase in extreme long shot as if to underscore that his movie shares DNA with the western. It does, but the point has already been made. Heâ€™s on more interesting ground when he plays up the storyâ€™s fairy-tale quality, particularly in an unsettling, violent scene with Addison and a family that plays out like a grim (Grimm) reprise of his childhood."

The stereotypes and coincidences are piled high along with the family baggage. Does it matter? Not really. The pleasures of genre films are often measured in degrees and by clichÃ©s that have been shifted rather than exploded. When Liza and Jay slow dance at one point, youâ€™re watching a scene that youâ€™ve seen countless times.

Forced to creep around the edges, Ms. Linney makes a show out of Daisyâ€™s awkwardness; to watch her pantomime of a wallflower is to watch an actress struggling to remain true to a character without fading in turn. (Bette Davis would have made this mouse roar.) Daisyâ€™s dreariness is so persuasive that whenever Eleanor or Missy (Elizabeth Marvel), another of Franklinâ€™s lovers, charge in, you long to follow them into another film â€” one in which everyone really does live in interesting times."

The directors, Bill and Turner Ross, follow William, Bryan and Kentrell Zanders (along with their dog, Buttercup) along the bustling New Orleans street that gives the movie its name. The boys â€” William, the youngest, is perched on the edge of adolescence; Bryan and Kentrell are in their teens â€” set off for a night of wandering that has overtones of an archetypal quest. The last ferry home across the Mississippi leaves at midnight, and if they miss it they risk being trapped in a world of dangerous and alluring enchantments."

Her manager favors the Latina workers, or so she believes; worse, her young son, Georgie (Austin Wayne West), has been taken away from her. She visits him soon after the story opens, dropping by the foster home where he lives and that, with its tidy lawn and swing set, looks pretty as a picture.

The director David Riker, working from his own script, sets up â€œThe Girlâ€ù nicely. There are early flickers of drama, mostly from a social services worker who checks in on Ashley as well as from talk about a court decision that might reunite her with Georgie. Ashley looks and talks angry, yet even with her periodic outbursts â€” she yells at Georgieâ€™s caretaker that only money separates her from her son â€” thereâ€™s something amorphous about her rage. Thereâ€™s next to no urgency to her demeanor and, despite the loss of her son, not a lot that feels worryingly at stake."

Yet while he makes it clear that she bears some responsibility for her situation, he fills in the bleak contours of her world better than he does those of her interior landscape. This limits Ashley, who, despite her frowns, has none of the hard edges that poverty can bring, none of its scars. She often registers as more petulant than wounded, almost spoiled, and also a bit blank. When her father, Tommy (Will Patton), visiting from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, swings by, laughing like a hyena and splashing booze, he gives the movie a jolt."

Rosa wants her mom and Ashley wants to go home, and while Ashley resists Rosa, her resistance isnâ€™t convincing or long lived.

Ashleyâ€™s father may have moved to Nuevo Laredo (another city plays the role here) because of his illegal pursuits, but his cavalier demeanor when he walks its streets and drinks in its bars rings as false as his smuggling.

The larger problem is that Mr. Riker wants to have his social realism and his sentimental uplift too. The shadowy Mexican streets and the desperate people, Ashleyâ€™s bitterness and ghastly carelessness with other peopleâ€™s lives, pull the movie in a direction that evokes the films of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (â€œThe Sonâ€ù), with their stories of moral awakenings. The ease with which Ashley surmounts her terrible choices â€” as well as her voyage deeper into a Mexico where a saint hands out opportune absolution â€” regrettably tugs the movie elsewhere.

How viewers interpret this look will depend on them because here and throughout this difficult, urgent movie Ms. Bigelow does not fill in the blanks for them.

We are clearly hungry to work through this raw subject. The most difficult scenes occur early and set the grim mood and moral stakes. (Later there are other, briefer visions of detainees being treated harshly.) It is hard to imagine anyone watching them without feeling shaken or repulsed.

Trusting the audience in this fashion is gutsy and all too rare in a movie released by a major studio. But it is an article of faith in â€œZero Dark Thirtyâ€ù that viewers are capable of filling in the blanks, managing narrative complexity and confronting their complicity.

And while they take up 15 of the movieâ€™s 156 minutes, they linger, casting a long, dreadful shadow over everything that comes after. The openings of movies are always significant (â€œRosebudâ€ù), and the key to understanding this one is grasping what occurs during its introductory passages. The movie actually begins with a prelude: a brief stretch of black screen accompanied by a disturbing collage of voices from Sept. 11. The first of the two interrogations with Ammar follows immediately after, a juxtaposition that asserts a cause and effect relationship between the void of Sept. 11 voices and the lone man strung up in a cell."

The second session ends with the screaming, babbling, weeping Ammar insisting that he doesnâ€™t know about a coming attack as he is sealed in the box. The final moment is shot from his point of view, and what follows is a scene of a terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia. This juxtaposition of the abuse and the massacre suggests, in cinematic terms, that torture does not save lives.

Set in contemporary Paris, it begins with the coupleâ€™s front door being breached by a group of firemen.

It opens with Georges and Anne, former music teachers, watching a concert by one of her prized students, the noted young pianist Alexandre Tharaud (as himself). Afterward they greet him backstage â€” Mr. Tharaud slices through a swarm of admirers to kiss her â€” and return home, an interlude set to his performance of Schubertâ€™s Impromptu (Op. 90, No. 1), a type of music thatâ€™s called a character piece and is meant to convey a mood or idea."

Perplexed, he waves a hand in front of her seemingly unseeing eyes. After a few beats, he dresses, presumably to get a doctor, but, as abruptly, Anne seems to return to normal.

Wildly self-centered, Eva asks about the operation only after she natters on about her work (sheâ€™s a musician), her husband and children. She may be embarrassed or unsettled by her motherâ€™s illness, but when Eva asks what she can do, her words sound hollow. â€œWeâ€™ve always coped, your mother and I,â€ù Georges says, maybe to reassure himself as much as a daughter who can feel like a stranger."

Mr. Haneke doesnâ€™t put his characters on the couch, offering up personalities that can be easily scanned and compartmentalized. As a consequence, his characters can be difficult to get a handle on, opaque, which might be frustrating if there wasnâ€™t so much meaning packed into their everyday conversations and gestures, including what they leave unsaid. Early on, for instance, Anne teases Georges â€” at least she seems to be teasing â€” by calling him a monster. She doesnâ€™t explain herself and neither does Mr. Haneke, which allows her meaning to reverberate, to grow steadily louder until it booms."

Georges tries to care for her by himself, but, in time, is forced to hire nurses. The inevitable is, well, inevitable. But in this movie it is also consistently surprising because of the clarity of Mr. Hanekeâ€™s vision. There is a great deal that is difficult to watch here, the indignities of a debilitating illness included, and the equally harsh pain of witnessing a great love, a longtime companion, slowly fade away. The moving, subtly brilliant performances of Ms. Riva (best known for â€œHiroshima Mon Amourâ€ù) and Mr. Trintignant (â€œA Man and a Womanâ€ù) are a particular gift in this respect. The two are, after all, at once forever young, immortalized in their films, and as familiar to us as our grandparents."

But â€œAmour,â€ù despite its agonizing subject, holds you willingly throughout. A key to understanding why comes at the beginning, when you see Georges and Anne at the concert, tucked in the audience thatâ€™s facing forward as if it were looking at the camera or, disconcertingly, us. Itâ€™s hard to see them, but theyâ€™re there, somewhat center and to the left, waiting and then clapping. Itâ€™s curious, this impression that the characters youâ€™re watching are in turn watching and even applauding you. The moment can be characterized as an instance of Brechtian estrangement, which is meant to break the effects of illusion and awaken an attitude of criticism in the audience. More simply, the theater audience directly mirrors the movie audience, eroding the nominal distance between them."

Viewers acquainted with Mr. Hanekeâ€™s work may find â€œAmourâ€ù too cold, cruel even, and its depiction of suffering a punishing, familiar gesture from a director whoâ€™s long been interested in transforming spectators from simple consumers into critical thinkers. There are certainly arguments to be made about whether movie-watching is ever simple or noncritical. Yet thereâ€™s another point to be made here, namely that all the violence in â€œAmourâ€ù is crucial to Mr. Hanekeâ€™s rigorous, liberatingly unsentimental worldview, one that gazes on death with the same benevolent equanimity as life. All of which is to say: bring hankies. This is a film that will make you weep not only because life ends but also because it blooms."

For more than a decade Mr. Petzold has been making his mark on the international cinema scene with smart, tense films that resemble psychological thrillers, but are distinguished by their strange story turns, moral thorns, visual beauty and filmmaking intelligence. His latest to open in the United States, â€œBarbara,â€ù begins in 1980 with an East German doctor from Berlin (Nina Hoss) who, after an unspecified offense, has been recently banished to the boonies.

It includes films that advocate revolution, like the 1966 classic â€œThe Battle of Algiers,â€ù and works that, more by virtue of their aesthetic choices, join the opposition. â€œBarbaraâ€ù is another type of resistance movie. Thatâ€™s partly because it concerns a dissident who, with modest, obstinate anger, pushes back against totalitarianism, but also because Mr. Petzold refuses movie clichÃ©s as strongly as he does political orthodoxy. At once regionally specific and a student of all cinema, he draws on numerous traditions and makes them his own. His early love of Hitchcock, for one, is evident in the prickles of unease that creep into his work, creating a cold climate of paranoia and an oft-justified fear of an imminent threat."

The implication is that sheâ€™s like a child and therefore incapable of making her own choices, an idea that helps define the political reality. Ms. Hoss, who has appeared in several of Mr. Petzoldâ€™s films, is a striking woman with a delicate face dominated by large, wide-set, somewhat baggy eyes. For much of the film she wears her blond hair pulled away from her face, which makes her character appear simultaneously vulnerable and watchful.

In some of the most visually arresting passages in this quietly beautiful movie, Barbara bikes alone along a country road next to a stand of windblown trees, her only accompaniment the sounds of the howling wind, churning leaves and cawing sea gulls.

Mr. Petzold takes his time revealing what makes Barbara tick, so that the full depth of her character emerges through her dealings with other people, through how she reacts to Klausâ€™s searches, Andreâ€™s attentions and Stellaâ€™s troubles. Each presses on her, insistently. Barbara doesnâ€™t necessarily say much in return, but with her arms folded across her body, she conveys a great deal. At one point, though, those arms drop.

His work in this passage, from the roller-coaster moves of the cameras to the loud incidental noise that muffles the lyrics, undermines his actors and begins to push the musical from spectacle toward bloat.

But if you have watched any of the previous episodes in Mr. Aptedâ€™s series, you will care, and deeply, partly because you watched that boy grow up, suffer and triumph in a project that began as a news gimmick and social experiment and turned into a plangent human drama. Conceived as a one-off for a current-affairs program on Granada Television, the first film, â€œSeven Up!,â€ù was a 40-minute look at the lives of 14 children from different backgrounds.

Despite some dropouts, the group has remained surprisingly intact.

The abrupt juxtapositions of epochs can be jarring, unnerving or touching â€” sometimes all three â€” as bright-faced children bloom and sometimes fade within seconds. An analogous project in print or even still photographs wouldnâ€™t be as powerful, because what gives the â€œUpâ€ù series its punch is not so much its longevity or the human spectacle it offers, but that these are moving images of touchingly vibrant lives at certain moments in time and space.

In the past he has brought participants together, but he doesnâ€™t here, which feels like a missed opportunity.

Lending the story an extra shiver is that the director, BenjamÃ_n ÃÅvila, making his feature debut, has said that the movie isnâ€™t just drawn from true events, but also his life.

One big difference is that the parents in â€œClandestine Childhoodâ€ù arenâ€™t fleeing the law because of their past deeds but are trying violently to overthrow a current dictatorship. Juan and his sister are in constant danger partly because of Charo and Danielâ€™s bullets and ideology, living in a perilous reality that the children have had no say in.

There are many such images. Working with the director of photography IvÃ¡n Gierasinchuk and shooting in high-end digital, Mr. ÃÅvila creates an intimate, richly tactile and impressionistic picture of a once-upon-a-time in childhood, using close-ups of hands, mouths and eyes in certain scenes that feel more remembered than lived in."

(Mr. Riva also animated several other sequences, including a light, bright, childlike one with Che Guevara.) The animated sections pop, but itâ€™s unclear if Juan sees his life as a comic book and is coping with its brute reality by transforming it into a cartoon. Or is Mr. ÃÅvila â€” who, in telling this seductive, adult story through a child, ended up limiting its depth and scope â€” trying to say something about personal and political memory? When a filmmaker proves as reluctant as Mr. ÃÅvila to speak up about the past, to engage with its full complexity, it can be hard to hear what heâ€™s saying."

This is a place so ominous that the sun never seems to shine, leaving the gray streets and people washed in an icy blue light. One glance and itâ€™s obvious that this is New York, though itâ€™s a city Mr. Hughes has painted a darker shade of noir."

The exits, in other words, are no longer completely blocked. Whether this reflects age, a philosophical shift or studio pressure, the movies feel less closed in than they once did. Thereâ€™s plenty of bleak to go around in â€œBroken City,â€ù yet there is also more tonal variation and a worldview that hews toward human complexity rather than toward comic-book Manichaeism."

But if you donâ€™t listen to the dialogue too hard, if you tune out a bit and instead watch the screen â€” notice how the restless cameras prowl around the actors and how shards of bright color pierce the pooling black night â€” then â€œBroken Cityâ€ù satisfies like the solid B movie it is. Written by Brian Tucker, the story traces, if somewhat distractedly, the moral education of Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg), a cop who, shortly after the movie opens, shoots a man dead and is forced to turn in his badge. Itâ€™s the sort of blunt, early narrative shock, a triggering incident, as it were, that strongly suggests where the rest of the story will lead."

One reason is that Mr. Tucker, whoâ€™s also a playwright, thickens the plot of this, his first produced feature, with a larger-stakes corruption tale involving the mayor, Hostetler (Russell Crowe, miscast but charismatic), the mayorâ€™s wife, Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones, classing up the joint nicely) and an assortment of courtiers and connivers, including a Machiavellian police commissioner, Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright, bearded, bald and sly). Also stirring up trouble is a mayoral rival with wet, beseeching eyes and a cartoon name, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper, very fine)."

Now he works as a private detective and keeps odd hours in his enviously situated Brooklyn office. His name is on the door, and thereâ€™s a pretty blonde, Katy (Alona Tal), taking his messages at a desk. Given the old-school setup, and the intimations of gumshoes and genres past, the blonde should be giving her boss the once over as she straightens the seams on her stockings. Mostly, while clearly soft on him, she just pleasantly nags Billy for not chasing down delinquent clients. Heâ€™s that type of guy, which is another reason that doubts about his character never loom especially large. Although, really, itâ€™s Mr. Wahlbergâ€™s native good-guy appeal that keeps doubts at bay."

Unlike Mr. Crowe, whose peering, wary eyes always make it look as if heâ€™s working an angle, sussing out the competition (and co-stars) to gain an advantage, Mr. Wahlberg often looks almost surprised by whatâ€™s happening around him. That may not always be a useful quality for a detective, but it can work well for a filmmaker and an ethically and narratively challenged protagonist. In â€œBroken Cityâ€ù Billy is always lagging behind events and other people, running into a scene after a deadly shot has been fired, misinterpreting gestures and making missteps that only make him vulnerable."

Mr. Hughes tells this latest iteration with characteristic technical virtuosity, and while heâ€™s overly fond of circling camera movements, the silky, gyrating choreography of the cinematography does create a sense of a spinning web that works reasonably well. His visual choices can feel borrowed and clichÃ©d, but his regard for beauty often compensates for his blunders, as does the sturdy, reliable appeal of another story of good and evil, men and women, light and dark, glass and steel, sex and power.

Short on long talk, Bobo spits out words like nails (â€œI got some rulesâ€ù) and uses a gun to pound in his meaning. One advantage of such taciturn brutalism is that thereâ€™s no need to second-guess him: he does what he promises, as when he tells someone, â€œIâ€™m going to kill you.â€ù Thereâ€™s an absurdly comic purity to lines like this that suggest that the filmmakers, having already ignored little details like complex characters and psychological motivations, decided to whittle the whole thing down to its generic core."

Although he shares the burden with co-stars like Jon Seda and Jason Momoa, the movie most probably owes its existence to Mr. Stallone and the movie history he hauls along with him. He seems more totem than man these days, which partly has to do with the flickering specters of Rocky and Rambo but also with the ravages of age and other assaults. To look at the cubistic arrangement that constitutes Mr. Stalloneâ€™s face and to witness his fairly restricted physical performance â€” he apparently fractured his neck a few years ago and now barely seems able to turn his head â€” is to gaze upon a god at twilight. He is at once unearthly and more poignantly human than he has been in years."

The exchanges fall flat, as does so much here, including a little family filler with Boboâ€™s daughter (Sarah Shahi, one of the token women) and some all-purpose intrigue with a couple of suits (Christian Slater and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje).

Given that Summit Entertainment, the company releasing â€œWarm Bodies,â€ù also turned Ms. Meyerâ€™s â€œTwilightâ€ù books into a global screen phenomenon, it seems it has decided that romances between sort of dead boys and living girls is a niche it can fill.

As it is, the veteran directors and brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani shot the story in Rebibbia Prison, outside of Rome, and used male inmates and several former convicts to play all the roles. Working from their sharply abridged, Italian-language adaptation (Fabio Cavalli has a â€œscreenplay collaborationâ€ù credit), the Tavianis open the movie in the playâ€™s final act with Brutus (an excellent Salvatore Striano) raising a sword in self-sacrifice. Brutus â€” one of the playâ€™s villains and its supremely tragic figure â€” will soon ask an aide to hold the sword so that he can run into it (assisted suicide being one prerogative of his station), an act that closes the circle opened by Caesarâ€™s murder."

Caesarâ€™s wife, Calpurnia, who memorably cries out in the night (â€œThey murder Caesar!â€ù) is missing, as is Brutusâ€™ wife, Portia, and assorted friends, senators and tribunes. The Senate is gone, and so too the Forum and the battlefield. What remains are men: scheming, agonizing, murdering men. Thereâ€™s an elemental, almost primitive quality to the Tavianisâ€™ condensing that, at its most effective, dovetails with the prisonâ€™s severely circumscribed material reality, as if the high walls, barred windows and suffocating rooms were manifestations of the charactersâ€™ states of mind."

Each inmate briefly introduces himself and his life and then acts, either with comic overstatement or startling intensity, the same nondescript scene.

(It was shot in high-definition video that has such fine detail that you can play connect the dots with the actorsâ€™ pores.) The Tavianisâ€™ movie is necessarily less involved (it runs 76 minutes) than Shakespeareâ€™s play, with most of their story given over to men rehearsing. Every so often, real life â€” or rather the approximation being played on camera â€” intrudes. Two prisoners bicker while rehearsing a scene, their private argument mirroring the dynamics in the drama.

Again and again, though, the Tavianis seem to want you to infer something about the inmates from the lines they recite, as when Cassius (Cosimo Rega), while washing his hands in Caesarâ€™s blood, states that the assassinsâ€™ scene will be repeated, a nod at past and future murders as well as at other less bloody performances. You can only guess what the lines mean to the inmates, who register as atmospheric blanks at best and brutal exotics at worst, even if the tale that they enact with such earnest vigor works because the original tragedy does. The playâ€™s the thing, to borrow another line, far more than the jailhouse setting is, which is this movieâ€™s great, unsurprising revelation."

The story turns on a thief who sometimes goes by Diana (Melissa McCarthy), who wreaks havoc on a milquetoast, Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman), by stealing his credit cards and more. The two become one of those belligerent odd couples who are forced on the road together chockablock with stereotypes, gun violence, visual clichÃ©s and cruel comedy. Diana, a kewpie doll with a crazy smile and five-alarm blaze of hair, is the target of most of the jokes, but until the filmmakers put out her fire with a bucket of tears and sentimental slop, sheâ€™s also the movieâ€™s bliss."

Diana enters shortly before Sandy is hired for a job that bumps his income to six figures from five. An Everyman, Sandy comes with the usual pretty wife (Amanda Peet) and cute kids, with another on the way. More unusually, the family is almost broke and lives in an apartment instead of one of those movie dream houses that pass as middle-class homes. Sandyâ€™s new position represents a step up for the family, which means that Diana doesnâ€™t just rip him off, she also threatens his upward mobility."

Once Sandy finds Diana, whoâ€™s nesting in a Florida house that looks as if it had been dipped in a vat of Pepto-Bismol, the movie enters more predicable territory. From her gut-churning pink home to the blue shadow plastered on her eyes, Sandy is a cornucopia of conventional bad taste. Sheâ€™s a liar and a thief, but sheâ€™s also tacky, low-rent, vulgar, with a mouth and manners as loud as the floral prints she wears."

Diana isnâ€™t the brilliant, gender-bending presence that Ms. McCarthy inhabited so brilliantly in â€œBridesmaids,â€ù a movie that rejoiced in messy female behavior. Even so, from the moment Diana comes on screen in â€œIdentity Thief,â€ù sugar-talking Sandy out of his information while sheâ€™s slurping a soda, Ms. McCarthy owns the movie. The character may be drawn in broad strokes, but Ms. McCarthy slips between the saucy and the demonic with exquisite effortlessness, fluttering her lashes and flashing her dimples one minute, unleashing her inner Medusa the next."

Diana will teach Sandy something, and he will teach her something in turn, and then everything will fit tidily, phonily together, or something like that. That said, as is the case with other unsatisfactory diversions, it is entirely possible to ignore the worst parts of this movie, to drift along during the lulls, slide over the half-baked jokes and just wait for Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Bateman to do their things.

Sometimes the words brush up against other words, creating a glimmer of larger meaning; at other times, they bob along alone. The sound quality of the two words is muddy enough that I initially thought that the woman was yelling, â€œHell me!,â€ù which suggested that we were being readied for a tumble down the existential rabbit hole."

Convention dictates, as does the marketplace, that there are only so many things that can happen after boy meets girl, or even boy meets boy, as a lifetime of movies teaches you. Mr. Foreman, by contrast, doesnâ€™t play with established forms; he invents his own.

For early filmgoers the close-up, especially that of the human face projected on big screens, signaled a crucial aesthetic difference between movies and theater. Mr. Foreman, who founded the famed Ontological-Hysteric Theater in 1968, has for years incorporated video into his stage plays and may well have included videotaped close-ups in his theater works, but as a stand-alone, recorded work rather than a live performance, this feels like a new frontier for him.

It has a clammy medical anxiety that recalls â€œContagion,â€ù hints of the corporate shenanigans of â€œThe Informant!,â€ù the do-gooder convictions of â€œErin Brockovichâ€ù and an eye for high-end New York environments that defined â€œThe Girlfriend Experience.â€ù"

Ms. Englert and Mr. Ehrenreich are naturally appealing, but when Mr. LaGravenese wants to push the story so that it feels as if something is truly at stake, he calls in the adults.

Even so, the movie almost predictably begins to sag in the middle (even with the judicious modifications thereâ€™s a lot to cram in) but not tediously so.

Ethan sees those scars, but their meaning doesnâ€™t seem to register with him. For Lena and him history is something that flickers to life only vaguely, an idea thatâ€™s literalized when they go to the movies and a battle scene from the 19th century runs in front of them like a film.

Mr. LarraÃ_nâ€™s attention to period detail is of course a familiar filmmaking strategy that gives the movie a patina of verisimilitude, as does his liberal sampling from the original, often hilarious No ads. More unusually, however, he also shot the movie using a couple of rebuilt vintage Sony U-Matic video cameras. This gives it a blurred, muddy, off-putting look, at least when the movie is projected, because blowing up video images amplifies visual artifacts, including eye-gouging distortions like visible scan lines and color that looks as if itâ€™s on the verge of separating."

Thereâ€™s a somewhat gimmicky aspect to Mr. LarraÃ_nâ€™s use of video that superficially brings to mind â€œThe Artist,â€ù in which the black-and-white images and absence of spoken dialogue are meant to mimic the filmmaking era. One difference is that while â€œThe Artistâ€ù seeks to seduce you with a nostalgic simulation, the anti-aesthetic of â€œNoâ€ù is initially so distracting that it can bring you out of the movie. As time goes on and the story deepens â€” and your interest does too â€” you grow so accustomed to the visuals that you largely stop noticing them or at least being bothered by them. In other words, you become used to the ugliness."

As it is, Rene is one of those compromised characters whose obvious virtues run a tight race with his flaws. In one early scene he doesnâ€™t just stand by when Veronica is beaten by cops; he also recoils from the violence. Itâ€™s unclear if Rene is a garden-variety coward, afraid of physical harm, or whether his fear is a manifestation of a deeper moral stain. The casting of the appealing Mr. GarcÃ_a Bernal suggests that Mr. LarraÃ_n has rigged the game, but what heâ€™s done is create a recognizably real, sometimes uncomfortably imperfect character instead of a politically correct prop."

Although Rene has recently returned from Mexico (Mr. GarcÃ_a Bernal is Mexican), heâ€™s neither a man of the right nor the left. His father is an anti-Pinochet activist, but Rene is himself a capitalist tool and apparently a happy one. As an advertising whiz he embodies a consumer society in which everything â€” democracy, freedom, the self â€” is for sale. Rene helps the No activists wage war against one type of dictatorship, but an argument can be made that he represents another kind of tyranny, one in which freedom is reduced to freedom of consumer choice."

As the movie unwinds, it also becomes evident that, for all her daring, Isabelle is more decorative than narratively necessary.

Itâ€™s a spatial arrangement that announces their independence even as everything else â€” clothes, gestures and camera movements â€” unites them. Given the sizzle and fiery sparks, the bright green smudged across the image and the thick summery feeling enveloping it all, this could be the Fourth of July, or just another day in that paradise, soon lost, called youth."

Their names and other scene-setting information emerge piecemeal, usually in disjointed conversations that sound as if they were caught on the fly. Thereâ€™s no inciting incident or barbed narrative hook, and itâ€™s unclear if this is a fictional work or a documentary. Unguided by obvious story signposts, you slip from image to image, pulled along by their beauty (the digital cinematography is by Chris Dapkins) and by the dreamy, leisurely rhythms of the editing (by Seth Bomse)."

As with some of Mr. Van Santâ€™s movies, the title here is enigmatic, though its meaning is suggested by a sequence of one of the boys, Max (Max Schaffner), wandering through some thick woods with a girl. In long shot the two seem very small and the woods very big, and while the teenagers look as if they could be swallowed up by this place, it also gives them shelter."

Yet while you can be fully absorbed in a movie, unless youâ€™re a child or certifiable, you never actually put aside your belief in the real world â€” you just happily agree to go along with the fictional flow. Some directors never spin their lies successfully enough for this to happen, while others blow it with anachronisms, miscasting, shoddy filmmaking, dumb choices or merely a solitary false note.

His second movie, the swoony charmer â€œHeartbeats,â€ù takes style even more seriously, both in its allusive execution â€” he draws giddily from things like the Nouvelle Vague and Wong Kar-wai â€” and its subject: self-fashioning and teasing, unfulfilled desire."

She is delighted when her cleverness and commitment are noticed by her gay godfathers, both named Mark (Timothy Spall and Oliver Platt) and by their friend Bella (Annette Bening), an American writer of uncompromising seriousness."

In â€œSpring Breakersâ€ù Mr. Korine has traded in his plug-uglies for a far more seductive and commercially viable female quartet that includes two former Disney teen queens, Selena Gomez (as Faith) and Vanessa Hudgens (Candy), along with Ashley Benson (Brit) and his wife, Rachel Korine (Cotty)."

From another it comes off as the apotheosis of the excesses it so spectacularly displays. That Mr. Korine appears to be having it both (or many) ways may seem like a cop-out, but only if you believe that the role of the artist is to be a didact or a scold.

Buzzing with the trills of incoming calls and the hum of reassuring voices, the hive is where every rote greeting â€” â€œ911, what is your emergency?â€ù â€” becomes the opening line in a never-ending procession of melodramas, comedies, dramas, tragedies and horror stories like the one that puts the chill in this no-frills diversion."

Like Steven Soderberghâ€™s epidemiological nightmare, â€œContagion,â€ù in which a miscellany of federal agencies saves humanity, the heroes in â€œThe Call,â€ù including Jordan (a fine Ms. Berry), are largely Los Angeles government workers â€” beat cops, fingerprint technicians and call-center operators of all races and ethnicities â€” who are presumably collecting a livable wage and benefits.

Which is why, after an inexperienced operator starts bungling a distress call from a kidnapped teenager, Casey (Abigail Breslin, at once grown up and believably adolescent), Jordan climbs back in the saddle. Jaw and shoulders squared, she puts on her headset, stares purposely ahead and, as rescue plans go into overdrive, starts smooth-talking Casey down from convulsive hysteria to panic."

Itâ€™s a harrowing situation for her and a potentially tricky one for filmmakers, as is apparent from how dissimilar directors handle characters trapped in rooms, coffins, airplanes and the claustrophobia-inducing like. Here, the director Brad Anderson, working from Richard Dâ€™Ovidioâ€™s script, tucks you inside a car trunk with Casey, using close-ups that turn her face into a vista and tears into rivers. And, then, just when youâ€™ve grown accustomed to that face, have started worrying about it, he cuts to Jordan who â€” with the call center often blurred behind her, as if the world and its certainties were disappearing â€” is in a very different tight place."

Sheâ€™s an old-fashioned hero in many respects, so itâ€™s fitting that Mr. Anderson uses old-fashioned filmmaking techniques, like crosscutting, to build tension, and old-school exploitation tricks, like evil, to justify taking the story dark, and then dark and bonkers. He slithers under your skin easily. Yet even as he ably demonstrates his gift for making meaning visually, say, by playing interiors against exteriors, he never showboats at Casey and Jordanâ€™s expense.

For the writers of â€œLeonie,â€ù Hisako Matsui (who also directed) and David Wiener, the short answer is that sheâ€™s the mother of the sculptor Isamu Noguchi. And the long answer is this plodding film.Leonie (Emily Mortimer, who against all odds creates a credible character) meets and falls in love with a Japanese poet, Yone Noguchi, who is living in New York. She becomes his editor, lover and the mother of his child. For some reason â€” motivations in â€œLeonieâ€ù are either murky or too neatly explained â€” he dumps her when sheâ€™s pregnant and moves back to Japan. She joins him there, but their relationship is over, and she strikes out on her own."

Starting this way is pretty much akin to a bull locking itself in a china shop. The director of head-rushing entertainments like â€œ28 Days Laterâ€ù and â€œ127 Hours,â€ù Mr. Boyle is a flamboyant visual stylist with a punk rockerâ€™s delight in anarchic jolts.

It takes a while to grasp just how classic (as in Turner Classic Movies) the material is, partly because Mr. Boyle enjoys using devices, like actors directly addressing the camera, that create a chummy, conspiratorial connection between you and his characters. Itâ€™s a clever strategy and sometimes a nice sleight of hand. When the pretty actor James McAvoy starts talking into the camera in â€œTrance,â€ù peering at you with his moist, sensitive eyes, you may find yourself distractedly cozying up to him rather than paying attention to the big picture materializing around him."

The Goya has gone missing from the auction house but also slipped out of Franckâ€™s reach. Simon should know where it is, but having been hit hard on the head, heâ€™s forgotten its whereabouts.

When Elizabeth ushers Simon into her office, you may notice the severity of her hairstyle and wonder about her curiously dull-colored clothing, which seems purposely designed to camouflage her beauty.

Mr. Ahearne wrote and directed a 2001 British television movie thatâ€™s the basis for â€œTrance,â€ù which in turn received a makeover from Mr. Hodge, who wrote a few of Mr. Boyleâ€™s somewhat harder-edged, cheerfully nihilistic (or rather nihilism-flavored) films, like â€œShallow Grave.â€ù"

Mr. Boyle, as always, works hard to cast a spell in â€œTranceâ€ù and his energy and commitment to the audienceâ€™s entertainment are evident in every scene.

Sex is explicit and often captured from the waist down, underscoring the detachment that Simon seems unable to overcome. And though the filmâ€™s ice-cold blend of the cerebral and the atavistic can be off-putting, it enables a queasy portrait of moral disengagement that lingers long after Simon has slipped from the screen."

That, at any rate, appears to be the principal, really the only point of the impishly, unfortunately titled â€œItâ€™s a Disaster,â€ù an underbaked comedy about eight people facing their mortality. Set in the present, it mostly unfolds in a Los Angeles house within gasping distance of a large-scale catastrophe of the kind usually let loose by masters of disaster, like Roland Emmerich. The writer and director, Todd Berger, is working on a far smaller scale than his blockbuster brethren do, and that may explain why he keeps calamitous details fuzzy, using two corpses, a Hazmat suit and a murder of crows to suggest the apocalyptic big picture."

The hook is a couplesâ€™ brunch, a regular get-together that none seem to enjoy yet nevertheless habitually attend, mostly so they can complain about their lives, spouses, whatever. The couples include the unhappy hosts, two swingers and two dullards, who all feel as if they belonged in different movies. Such disconnectedness could be productive, but Mr. Berger doesnâ€™t want to exploit it or is blind to it. The liveliest, most persuasively acted, if oddly matched pair are played by Julia Stiles and David Cross. Their characters feel out of place too, but benefit from narrative tension, and the actors have timing, presence and the good will that comes with some rÃ©sumÃ©s."

Instead he tries to squeeze out pathos and sentimentality along with the largely unfunny ha-ha and hooting, which leads to an unengaging confusion of characters and moods. The movie lurches from the improbably silly to the drearily so, while the characters remain so emotionally and psychologically divorced from life that they might as well be zombies or sitcom stick figures. The movieâ€™s unrelenting visual drabness only adds to the unfortunate sense that while the end will come soon for them, it isnâ€™t coming anywhere near fast enough."

This is partly because the human situation in the center of the film does not quite support its philosophical scaffolding and partly because the images, gorgeous as they are, do not in themselves possess the evocative power Mr. Malick intends them to have. He works in a shorthand that can sometimes feel facile rather than profound. Images of Neilâ€™s work sampling soil and water at industrial sites and of poor and disabled Oklahomans appear as tokens rather than expressions of social and environmental concern.

In one of its most entertaining sequences, shot in Berlinâ€™s Alexanderplatz in the mid-1980s, we watch dumbfounded as a blond skating god named Patrick travels the length of the square in a casual handstand.

In tone, mood and image quality, it is suffused with light. At times, it is brightened by sunshine that poured through windows of the SoHo loft in which, once upon a Manhattan time, Mr. Mekas lived with his young family, several cats, a lot of plants, many more books and stacks and stacks of film cans and boxes. The streaming sun turned hair into halos and illuminated faces and rooms. It also flowed through Mr. Mekasâ€™s camera, inscribing shadow images of these children, those plants, the dancing cats, that smiling woman, on the loops of film he has now returned to."

She appears throughout the movie, along with their children, Oona and Sebastian, and together they present an unposed, casually intimate portrait of domestic tranquillity. Every so often, one, two or three will walk on a city sidewalk or in some country greenery. She looks at the camera more than the children, who often ignore it as if it were any other household appliance, which it was. Only once does a child seem irked by the cameraâ€™s presence or possibly the man behind it; whatever the case, it jerkily shifts view, a move suggestive of a hurriedly averted gaze."

By the late 1950s, with films like Robert Frank and Alfred Leslieâ€™s â€œPull My Daisyâ€ù pointing the way toward true independence, Mr. Mekas shifted his sightlines from the commercial cinema and its restrictions. In a 1959 Voice column, he wrote, â€œWe need less perfect but more free films.â€ù Art and industry must be decoupled: â€œThere is no other way to break the frozen cinematic conventions than through a complete derangement of the official cinematic senses.â€ù He lived what he wrote and over time broke free, too, developing a deeply personal, palpably handmade style in diary films in which the past jostled against the present and the thrum of everyday life became an occasion for ecstatic reverie."

Although much of its focus is on his wife and children, his extended family is also represented in the form of the literary likes of Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, and filmmakers like Ken Jacobs and Peter Kubelka. Every so often, Mr. Mekas slips in contemporary images of himself at a table, winding reels and splicing together bits of films. Before movies were edited on computers, they were cut with a blade and the resultant pieces often joined together with glue or tape, a labor-intensive task. He looks like a factory worker at that table, which seems paradoxical given that he abandoned industrial filmmaking, but it also fits his cinematic labors of love."

Like so much of his lifeâ€™s work, the movie is a gift from a man who, in between making films and writing about them, helped establish both the Film-Makersâ€™ Cooperative and Anthology Film Archives.

In 1947, a Norwegian zoologist and adventurer, Thor Heyerdahl (Pal Sverre Hagen), set sail for Polynesia from Peru in a balsa-wood raft that he called Kon-Tiki, after a sun god. Heyerdahl (1914-2002) had lived in Polynesia in the late 1930s, and through his studies had developed some unorthodox ideas about early migrations to the islands. Unlike other researchers, who embraced the theory that Polynesia had been populated by way of Asia, Heyerdahl argued that the islanders originated in South America."

He then set sail with five other men, four Norwegians and a Swede, who in the movie register as more or less indistinguishable sunburned blonds. After 101 days they landed on the Raroia Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago. Thereafter, Heyerdahl became a media star: his book, â€œThe Kon-Tiki Expedition,â€ù was translated into multiple languages and a 1950 documentary about the expedition won an Oscar. He went on to other adventures, which are documented at the helpful Web site for the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo."

In the 2009 book â€œThe Wayfinders: Why Ancient Wisdom Matters in the Modern World,â€ù the anthropologist Wade Davis writes that Heyerdahl â€œinverted history itselfâ€ù with his claims about the Polynesian migration. â€œIn making his sensational claim,â€ù Mr. Davis writes, â€œThor Heyerdahl ignored the overwhelming body of linguistic, ethnographic and ethnobotanical evidence, augmented today by genetic and archaeological data, indicating that he was patently wrong.â€ù That sounds like grounds for another kind of film, one that would necessarily take a less heroic, more complex approach toward science, its uses and possible abuses."

The men are handsome, the sea is pretty and if the sharks look as rubbery as last weekâ€™s chicken, at least they add some drama â€” and buckets of sloshing blood and guts â€” to what otherwise proves a dull affair.

Some of this occurs in the company of Sorina (Bar Paly), a Romanian-born stripper who had previously dated Daniel and who believes that he and his partners are government agents on a dangerous, top-secret mission."

Mr. Reygadasâ€™s children, Rut and Eleazar, also play Juanâ€™s children. (In scenes in which the children appear older, the roles are played by others.)

The film doesnâ€™t unfold linearly, but instead jumps from one moment to the next, the different periods indicated primarily by Juanâ€™s changing hairstyles and the childrenâ€™s ages. Everything in the film may be in the past or may just be in the eternal, magnificent, maddening present that is Mr. Reygadasâ€™s consciousness."

The rich symbolism of the Italian landscape â€” the volcanic pools at Vesuvius, the ruins of Pompeii, the vistas that have stirred the imagination of artists at least since Virgil â€” makes the emptiness of the Joycesâ€™ marriage all the more palpable and painful.

Less convincing are his efforts to bring father and son together by continually cutting between Jeff and Tim (Ben Rosenfield), who is seen in flashback on the road and ignoring his life back home. Framed by a cloud of soft curls, Tim looks adorable and sounds like a jerk, whining that his wife doesnâ€™t like his music.

Wisely, Mr. Siegel and Mr. McGehee do not try to coax too much acting out of her. There are no displays of precocious insight or histrionic innocence.

Here, though, evil isnâ€™t simply banal, itâ€™s also associated with class-coded bad taste, of a primitivism and vulgarity that are interchangeable with murder and are only funny if you think about it as little as the characters do."

I grant that this is not so easily done. F. Scott Fitzgeraldâ€™s slender, charming third novel has accumulated a heavier burden of cultural significance than it can easily bear. Short and accessible enough to be consumed in a sitting (as in â€œGatz,â€ù Elevator Repair Serviceâ€™s full-text staged reading), the book has become, in the 88 years since its publication, a schoolroom staple and a pop-cultural totem. It shapes our increasingly fuzzy image of the jazz age and fuels endless term papers on the American dream and related topics."

If â€œThe Great Gatsbyâ€ù canâ€™t quite sustain the Big Ideas that are routinely attached to it â€” a fact that periodically inspires showboating critical contrarians to proclaim that itâ€™s not such a big deal after all â€” it nonetheless remains a lively, imaginative presence. The book may not be as Great as its reputation, but it is also, partly for that reason, better than you might expect. It is flawed and flimsy in some ways, but it still manages to be touching, surprising and, in its bittersweet fashion, a lot of fun."

Mr. Luhrmannâ€™s reverence for the source material is evident. He sticks close to the details of the story and lifts dialogue and description directly from the novelâ€™s pages. But he has also felt free to make that material his own, bending it according to his artistic sensibility and what he takes to be the mood of the times. The result is less a conventional movie adaptation than a splashy, trashy opera, a wayward, lavishly theatrical celebration of the emotional and material extravagance that Fitzgerald surveyed with fascinated ambivalence."

Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) is still a bully and a bigot, spouting the popular racist pseudoscience of his day. The gangster Meyer Wolfsheim (Amitabh Bachchan) is a bit less of a cringe-worthy anti-Semitic caricature than he was in 1925. The poverty of George and Myrtle Wilson (Jason Clarke and Isla Fisher) remains a grim contrast to the endless ease of Gatsby and the Buchanans.

Then again, Ms. Polley, her youngest, wasnâ€™t interested in making a traditional portrait of Mum, as her children call her, maybe because Mum wasnâ€™t especially traditional. Whatever the reason, you learn a lot about what other people think about Diane â€” whoâ€™s characterized as both independent and family-oriented, as an extrovert and an enigma â€” but relatively few facts. Thereâ€™s nothing about when or where she was born, whether she attended college or when she married. She acted, on and off, but whether she showed real talent remains undiscussed. That she was a good-enough actress, when and where it mattered, becomes evident."

Diane Polley took liberties, endured tragedies and set off on adventures, the full extent of which the Storytellers reveal with laughter and a deep well of melancholia. She comes across as simultaneously suburban and bohemian, locked into the usual roles and yet also stubbornly liberated from them. How she managed this â€” while raising her children and pleasing a husband who didnâ€™t always love her the way she needed â€” is central to the stories and secrets that Ms. Polley gently shares."

Although it touches on intimate points, many recounted by Michael Polley in voice-over, the movie is revelatory rather than exploitative. And while the movie finally proves as much an autobiographical tale as a biographical one, Ms. Polley resists turning it into a flattering self-portrait of a young artist in search of her origins. Instead, building on the interest in narrative form that she expressed in earlier movies like â€œTake This Waltz,â€ù she explores storytelling itself and the space between a life lived and its different, at times conflicting representations."

Everyone has his or her memories of Diane Polley, but most adhere to the communally accepted facts of her life. What matters to Ms. Polley is how each person organizes those memories, with love, humor, regret, self-interest or, in the case of Michael Polley, a sometimes wincing mix of emotional detachment and lacerating humor. To watch Ms. Polley â€” her face drained of readable emotion and her body vibrating, as if from unarticulated anxiety â€” as she watches Michael talk about Diane and their life together is unexpectedly moving. Not all of these stories are easy. Yet, unlike those filmmakers who explore their family histories to settle scores or indulge in self-mythology, Sarah Polley knows that it is never all about her."

And the movie, even as it answers a hunger for engagement with the life of an extraordinary mind, may also awaken an appetite for more.

The first is Arendtâ€™s coverage of the trial of Adolf Eichmann and the furor that followed the publication of her reporting, first as a series of articles in The New Yorker and then as the book â€œEichmann in Jerusalem.â€ù The second, presented in slightly awkward flashbacks, is Arendtâ€™s relationship with the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, her teacher and lover, who publicly joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and never publicly repented after the war."

The reaction to â€œEichmann in Jerusalemâ€ù was harsh and relentless, and Ms. von Trotta shows how it extended from the public realm of learned journalism into Arendtâ€™s personal life, costing her several longstanding friendships."

This decency is nice for viewers â€” genuine evil can become tiresome what with all the bloodletting and one-dimensional villainy â€” and it serves other useful functions, like investing the antihero with renegade moral authority. From the way Franck treats his family, and initially Jean-Louis, itâ€™s obvious that even if heâ€™s a convicted bank robber (a durably forgivable transgression), he isnâ€™t morally corrupt. Heâ€™s good enough to keep audiences on his side and just dangerous enough to keep the cops, the real offender and us jumping."

Fairly early, Mr. Bossi (who helped write Michel Gondryâ€™s next movie, â€œMood Indigoâ€ù) and Mr. Turner also introduce a group of detectives led by a hard-charging beauty, Claire (a surprisingly plausible Alice Taglioni). The cops soon come to believe that Franck is both a thief and the still-active serial killer, which leads to complication after complication and finds him â€” and the detectives, the national police and even some army personnel â€” racing across the rapidly shifting landscapes."

Every so often, Mr. Valette folds in a nicely choreographed action bit â€” at one point Franck darts through oncoming traffic on a highway while at another he hangs off a speeding train â€” that show off his chops and Mr. Dupontelâ€™s fitness.

Itâ€™s a measure of the filmâ€™s striking design here that the headdress latticework is echoed in some of the pleated clothing, as well as in the curvilinear buildings, suggesting that someone behind the scenes (the production designer is Alex McDowell) is an admirer of the architect Zaha Hadid and her flowing organic forms."

The resemblances to Earth are blunt enough for an eco-savvy kindergartner and pop off the screen like speech balloons. But, then, this is Superman, and Mr. Snyder, whose earlier movies include a stillborn adaptation of the graphic novel â€œWatchmen,â€ù is here playing with different narrative forms as he toggles between cinematic realism and the kind of comic-book-style exaggeration that distills ideas into images."

Jor-El and his wife, Lara Lor-Van (the Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer), decide to rocket their child to Earth, sending him off to safety in the futuristic equivalent of Mosesâ€™ basket. Given that Supermanâ€™s creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, were Jewish, much has been written about Supermanâ€™s similarities to Moses (â€œelâ€ù is a Hebrew word for God), which is complicated by the characterâ€™s likeness to Jesus. (Supermanâ€™s Earth mom was originally named Mary.) Mr. Snyder, with his characteristic lack of subtlety, hits the Jesus angle amusingly hard, primarily in a later scene in which Superman â€” framed by a stained-glass tableau of a supplicating Jesus draped in a red robe â€” consults with a priest in a church. By then, the rocketing baby has become the man and given a soul-sick mien. Thatâ€™s because the next time you see Kal-El after liftoff, heâ€™s all grown up and toiling on a fishing boat off the northwest Canadian coast, a filmic ellipsis that abruptly spans decades. A beat later and heâ€™s also shirtless and holding back a tower wobbling on a burning oil platform. And then, like Hercules who rises from his funeral pyre â€” having cast off his mortal body and assumed his godly form â€” Superman, a k a Clark Kent, is engulfed in flames. Itâ€™s a nifty, startling image, even if it transforms Mr. Cavill, a pretty man whose body has been inflated to Bluto-esque proportions, into barbecue beefcake. Mr. Snyder, perhaps intuiting how fast this image could slip away from him, cuts his way out of there fast."

There are a number of overt references to the past in â€œMan of Steel,â€ù a title that itself summons up Americaâ€™s lost industrial history.

His handling of the storyâ€™s many flashbacks, which fill in piecemeal Supermanâ€™s Kansas childhood as Clark, is fluid and apt. Each return to the past becomes another tile in the mosaic, adding to the emerging portrait of the adult wanderer and seeker he has become. His adoptive parents, Martha (Diane Lane) and Jonathan (Kevin Costner), come into focus, as does the bewildered child (played by Cooper Timberline and Dylan Sprayberry), who doesnâ€™t understand why heâ€™s so different. Mr. Snyder borrows too many canted camera angles and too much sun-kissed fluttering laundry from Terrence Malick, but the Kansas scenes solidify the human foundation of a divided identity."

Itâ€™s hard to believe that any actor could compete with Terence Stampâ€™s dandified turn as Zod in the 1978 â€œSuperman,â€ù but Mr. Shannon, delightfully embracing gnashing-teeth villainy, proves one of the new filmâ€™s strengths. A true Krypton believer, Zod has his own good reasons for chasing after the being he knows as Kal-El. While these add another layer, they and everything else are almost lost in the last 45 minutes, when Mr. Snyder piles on the hammering special effects, becoming yet one more director gone disappointingly amok."

The gimmick traps us in a psychopathâ€™s body, but this is less scary than it could have been because of Mr. Woodâ€™s unimposing presence and delivery. By not centering on the victims, Mr. Khalfoun nearly makes the film about pitying the panic-prone killer; the camerawork lacks the ominous, confident glide of much Steadicam horror."

The first encounter happens in a scaring class, when the hard-working Mike â€” who looks like a cross between a walking eyeball and a spit-polished Granny Smith apple â€” is overshadowed by Sulley, whoâ€™s arrived believing that he can coast on his familyâ€™s frightening good name.

If it takes a while to notice, itâ€™s because Mr. Scanlon and his team have created a seductive world that blends photorealistic details â€” the streets, buildings and vehicles look like ours, but different â€” with impressionistic swaths and hyperbolic character designs, using a palette thatâ€™s heavy on purple and pink and flecked with orange, yellow and green.

Her face to the camera, the woman cries as they hold each other, but itâ€™s unclear whether he can see her tears. Her unexplained weeping and the ill-defined backdrop make an apt start for this intelligent, involving movie thatâ€™s by turns a murder mystery and a politically charged argument about contemporary Palestinian identity. That itâ€™s also about a troubled marriage becomes evident when the man, a successful Palestinian surgeon living and working in Tel Aviv, is awoken one night and discovers that both his wife and his safe, cosseted world have disappeared after a suicide bombing."

One token of his success is an Israeli award he accepts soon after the story opens, the first â€” as he lightly reminds his audience â€” given to an Arab in 41 years. If heâ€™s fazed by this, he doesnâ€™t say; mostly he seems gratified, and happy. Whether he means anything substantial by this seemingly casual nod at the past â€” specifically the 1970s, an era of spectacular terrorist attacks like that of the Palestinian group Black September on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics â€” it subtly, and necessarily, widens the movieâ€™s historical framework."

(The movie, which is neither pro- nor anti-Israel, has been banned in Lebanon.) The genesis for the movie is a 2005 novel of the same title by Yasmina Khadra, the pen name of Mohammed Moulessehoul, a former Algerian army officer living in France. The movie, written by Mr. Doueiri and his wife, JoÃ«lle Touma, retains much of whatâ€™s good in the book, including Aminâ€™s forced confrontation with the past, which begins the night heâ€™s called back to the hospital where he works. Minutes later, he is standing in a morgue and pulling a sheet off the mangled corpse of his wife, Siham (Reymonde Amsellem)."

Seen in flashbacks that will come to haunt this story, she comes across as a woman who at once was a sensual lover, a beautiful bride and a smiling wife, as well as a mystery â€” if only to her carelessly loving husband."

And, best of all, â€œWorld War Z,â€ù directed by Marc Forster from a script with four credited authors, reverses the relentless can-we-top-this structure that makes even smart blockbusters feel bloated and dumb. The large-scale, city-destroying sequences come early, leading toward a climax that is intimate, intricate and genuinely suspenseful."

There is both too much information here and too little: we see painful deathbed photographs, but hear barely a word about Kate McGarrigleâ€™s childhood or other experiences that might illuminate our understanding of her art.

Though Ashburn is smarter than her colleagues, she still has to endure their overt condescension and thinly veiled resentment. â€œNo wonder sheâ€™s single,â€ù one of them sneers after sheâ€™s just shown up a room full of men by finding hidden drugs and guns that had eluded them."

The radicalism of â€œFruitvale Stationâ€ù lies precisely here, in its refusal to turn a man into a symbol.

The seeming casualness is such that, at a certain point, you feel like a traveler on a real-life journey during which the tensions between Jamie and Crystal threaten to erupt into warfare. Crystal masks her frustration and anger by affecting an attitude of tolerant superiority toward Jamieâ€™s impatience and air of entitlement.

The Warrens quickly take care of business, and Mr. Wan does the same. With shock cuts, gliding camera movements, muted colors that evoke David Fincherâ€™s â€œZodiacâ€ù and tricks learned from â€œThe Twilight Zone,â€ù Mr. Wan â€” whose first sly shot is of a cracked, smiling face â€” sets a relentlessly uneasy tone that imperceptively shifts between intense seriousness and lightly mocking."

Itâ€™s been estimated that 75 percent of Americans believe in the paranormal, while only 54 percent believe global warming has begun. Evidently itâ€™s easier to believe in the terrors that canâ€™t hurt us than to believe in those that can, which may partly account for why so many vampires, zombies and their paranormal ilk are running amok in the popular imagination. Each era brings its own allegorical terrors, and in the 1970s, a golden age of horror cinema, the aftershocks of the 1960s found expression in stories about diabolically terrifying spawn who, with their swiveling heads and annihilating violence, were grotesque embodiments of a generational anxiety."

With amusing self-awareness, Mr. Wan (his earlier movies include â€œSawâ€ù and â€œInsidiousâ€ù) leans on the usual genre tricks throughout, making you jump with hard edits and doors being squeaked open by unseen hands. But he also makes intelligent use of narrative delay and ellipses that help build suspense and suspicion. The script generally doesnâ€™t overexplain, and neither does he. When things start going wrong at the Perronsâ€™ â€” a bird crashes into the house, bruises bloom on Carolynâ€™s body â€” the family knows somethingâ€™s amiss but canâ€™t read the signs. The deeply religious Warrens (Lorraine wraps rosary beads around one hand) think that they can, and do."

Their characters are as appealing as the Perrons, but Mr. Wan smartly keeps enough distance from the Warrens that you can see that these true believers are also hovering at the edge of dangerous fanaticism. That gives the movie a shiver of political currency even if a greater, more sustaining pleasure of this particular haunted-house fantasy is how it works as a metaphor for moviegoing itself. When the Perrons first settle into their house, theyâ€™re facing the future with bright, anxious smiles that arenâ€™t much different from those of the horror-film faithful who are waiting nervously, hopefully, to be jolted by the next great shocker.

And while Mr. To may not fill the movie with rousing speeches, either by inclination or out of political necessity, the brilliant, unsettling action scenes â€” ugly, savage, dehumanizing â€” speak volumes.

Choi and Zhang may be racing forward â€” all the characters rack up miles, their spinning wheels turning this into something of an intermittent road movie â€” but they never seem to get far enough.

Thatâ€™s a nice change from movies that needlessly hold your hand through every turn, but it also means that you shouldnâ€™t blink. If you do, you may wonder who the two scruffy guys are in the car thatâ€™s chasing the big truck thatâ€™s being driven by two other disheveled guys who seem to have something to do with Choi, whose path and fate will soon cross with those of Captain Zhang, once this heroically peripatetic detective gets off his bus."

That in itself is startling, as are so many of the details â€” a detective washing recently excreted balloons stuffed with drugs â€” that insistently underscore the human stakes in this war.

As she slips from tremulous flirtations to soused meltdowns, she elicits gasps of compassion and snorts of derision. Jasmine, nÃ©e Jeanette, having reinvented herself, had risen to become a member of New Yorkâ€™s elite but, with everything gone, has come to San Francisco to move in with her sister, Ginger (played with anxious sincerity by Sally Hawkins).

The flashbacks tell part of the story, as does Jasmineâ€™s faraway stare, her mood swings and the patter that telegraphs her privilege (â€œI donâ€™t know how anyone can breathe with low ceilingsâ€ù) and which, over time, will sound like the ravings of a homeless woman you might see in certain neighborhoods, the one in ratty furs pushing a cart."

Underscoring the resemblances, Jasmine repeatedly explains that â€œBlue Moonâ€ù was playing when she met Hal, memories that evoke the blue piano that, as Williams wrote in â€œStreetcar,â€ù expresses â€œthe spirit of the life which goes on here.â€ù In the play, Blanche also says that Stanley isnâ€™t the type who goes for jasmine perfume, an aside that carries an accusation."

But Mr. Allen isnâ€™t making a case against them, and neither descends into clichÃ© partly because, for all their macho bluster, the two are openly feminized, as if their libidinal energies were being put to better use. Augie and Chili take issue with Jasmine, but they donâ€™t brutalize her, much less set out to destroy her. She has, Mr. Allen suggests, already done the job herself."

So, too, did Hal, perhaps the storyâ€™s only real villain, but who, like Augie and Chili, never emerges as a serious countervailing force to Jasmine as Stanley is to Blanche. As if to make up for this missing piece, Mr. Allen himself advances the strongest argument against Jasmine. If he never succeeds in diminishing her appeal, itâ€™s both because Ms. Blanchett maintains a vise grip on the characterâ€™s humanity and because it becomes inexorably clear that, while losing her money helped push Jasmine over the edge, it was also the dirty, easy money, what it promised and delivered, that drove her nuts to begin with."

If at times Mr. Allen seems to be answering those questions by pulling the film in one direction even as Ms. Blanchett pulls it in another, this productive dissonance deepens the tension and stakes and, as with a climactic confrontation between Jasmine and Hal, can turn a raw scene into a revelation. This particular battle takes place in their living room, a mausoleumlike shrine to their wealth, painted green, where, against the color of money, they fight for their lives, frantically taking swings at each other without a thought to everyone else they are about to take down."

(Mr. Wahlberg has the sweet appeal of the young Mr. Gibson if none of the unnerving dangerousness.) In Steven Grantâ€™s original comic, Stig is called Steadman, and Bobby looks like a California surfer complete with a blond flop and goatee.

An irrepressible flirt, Stig plays with a pretty waitress, but itâ€™s soon clear that his heart belongs to Bobby. (Unlike in the â€œLethal Weaponâ€ù series, there isnâ€™t a dead wife or a living brood to bring anyone down.) Across from the diner thereâ€™s also a tiny bank that Bobby and Stig plan to relieve of $3 million belonging to Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos), the head of a Mexican drug cartel who, in turn, has recently relieved an associate of his head."

Some of its artificiality can be chalked up to the usual mainstream filmmaking imperatives, like stars who are at once recognizably real and prettier, thinner and sleeker, with whiter teeth and glossier skin, like the operative for the Drug Enforcement Agency played here by Paula Patton. Even Mr. Olmosâ€™s beautiful, craggy mug looks buffed. That same unreality principle extends to the story and Mr. Kormakurâ€™s bright, uncluttered style, which instantly shake off the real world and its obligations, thrusting the film straight into fantasy."

Working with an editor, Michael Tronick, who doesnâ€™t step on the sometimes wittily choreographed action by overcutting, Mr. Kormakur sets and keeps up a fast rather than frantic pace that never runs the movie off the rails even when the story nearly does.

One crucial difference is that â€œSunset Boulevardâ€ù and â€œMulholland Driveâ€ù each draw you in through the complex, destabilizing and productive play between irony and idealism. â€œThe Canyonsâ€ù initially appears to be doing much the same, as in a desultory introductory scene set at a bar-restaurant, except that idealism isnâ€™t anywhere on the menu."

These include Christian (James Deen, a porn star) and Tara (Ms. Lohan), a power couple first seen in a bar in the Chateau Marmont, an old hotel known for its bad, beautiful clientele and for being where John Belushi permanently checked out. Christian is a trust-fund brat and producer whoâ€™s managed to snare Tara, who in turn is hooked on his money. Theyâ€™re having dinner with his assistant, Gina (Amanda Brooks), and her boyfriend, Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk), whoâ€™s been cast in one of Christianâ€™s flicks. Christian and Tara spend more time looking at their phones than at their companions. This may signal their anomie, but, given the dull talk, they may merely be bored."

(The characters regularly use one anotherâ€™s names â€” â€œNobody has a private life anymore, Taraâ€ù â€” perhaps so they can remember who theyâ€™re talking to.) Mr. Schrader directs the actors to deliver some of their lines while facing the camera, a modest breach of the fourth wall that makes it seem as if the characters are talking to the audience. A favorite critical orthodoxy, one that builds on Brechtâ€™s concept of the epic theater, is that such breaches disrupt or break the cinematic illusion of reality, thereby making ostensibly passive viewers aware of the filmmaking processes and thus the ideology behind that illusion."

Ms. Brooks and Mr. Nolan deliver their lines unpersuasively, their sincerity bouncing off Ms. Lohanâ€™s and Mr. Deenâ€™s glazed personas. Ms. Lohan, ornamented with a topknot and Cleopatra eyeliner, wavers in and out of the scene much as she does for the rest of the movie, pulling you in with husky murmurings and pushing you away with darting glances that suggest a woman searching for the exit. Mr. Deen mostly just sneers (his default expression) while he details Christian and Taraâ€™s online hookups. Waving his cellphone, Christian says he makes his own movies."

Christian uses it to shoot videos of his sexcapades with Tara, but, more important in â€œThe Canyons,â€ù it serves as a signifier for the death of the movies. This idea is bluntly introduced through a succession of photographs of shuttered movie theaters that both appear in the opening credits and are inserted (accompanied by time stamps: Monday, Tuesday, etc.) throughout, creating something like chapters. The photos canâ€™t help bringing to mind Peter Bogdanovichâ€™s â€œLast Picture Show,â€ù in which the closing of a cinema in the 1950s serves as a eulogy both for a dying town and for a movie love rooted in a physical space."

In â€œThe Last Picture Show,â€ù Mr. Bogdanovich used the advent of television to signal the end of an era and the loss of a kind of cinematic experience. Thereâ€™s a similar idea about death and movies swirling in â€œThe Canyons,â€ù most obviously with the figure of Christian, an avatar of both entitlement and entertainment whoâ€™s solely interested in making pornographic home videos, not actual movies. When he waves his cell â€” that onanistic toy, emblem of pathological narcissism and augury of social dissolution â€” heâ€™s waving it not only at his dinner companions but also at us. Itâ€™s a provocative idea thatâ€™s soon lost amid the self-consciously deployed clichÃ©s that finally do the movie in."

With â€œThe Canyons,â€ù he tries to get at something real under all the hard, glossy surfaces, but ends up caught in the divide between the movie that he seems to have wanted to make and the one he did."

Sheâ€™s in the embrace of her lover, Mounir (Tahar Rahim), a young man with whom she is having a passionate, powerfully physical affair. Youth radiates from the couple, and the fact that theyâ€™re fumbling in a car like teenagers who have nowhere else to go only emphasizes their age.

An enigmatic figure whose mysteries peel away slowly, AndrÃ© scarcely seems interested in Murielle even when she eagerly tries to impress him. Her anxiety is understandable; heâ€™s something of a father figure to Mounir, who treats him with deference bordering on obsequiousness. For years, AndrÃ© has been taking care of Mounir and his relatives, both with money and immigration help, which might register as altruistic if Mounir didnâ€™t seem so anxious and AndrÃ© so controlling."

If Murielle doesnâ€™t seem to mind, itâ€™s partly because she doesnâ€™t have much of a family and, like Mounir, she very much wants to please AndrÃ©. She does in time, especially when she delivers a girl. Time passes, and sheâ€™s pregnant with a second child and then a third. Everyone gets along amid the shrieks and cluttered toys, but the rooms start to shrink, as does Murielleâ€™s smile. The men become snappish, demanding.

Disease, poverty and overpopulation â€” and, from the churning dust, presumably ecological ruin â€” have transformed the planet into a global ghetto.

Heâ€™s better with some big-picture details: On Earth, folks speak English and Spanish (Max switches between both), while on Elysium, the well-heeled drop a little French in between exchanging pleasantries and exercising their privilege.

Heâ€™s so homespun that he could have sprung wholly formed from a corn silo (he shares James Stewartâ€™s extraordinary likability if not his later-life, postwar neurotic edge).

Much as he did in â€œDistrict 9,â€ù a wobbly political allegory about crustaceanlike E.T.â€™s subjected to apartheid abuse in South Africa, Mr. Blomkamp builds on real catastrophes to create an admonitory tale. This is one of the axiomatic constructs of science fiction, which makes the familiar strange and the strange familiar, whether itâ€™s the dark, rainy Los Angeles of Ridley Scottâ€™s â€œBlade Runnerâ€ù or a Europe that foreshadows that of World War II in H.

However disquieting his technocratic remedy for what ailed his times, Wells meets the imaginative worst with a speculative resolution. In other words, he suggests an answer, something that has become scarce in the ravaged landscapes of many science-fiction movies. Mr. Blomkampâ€™s rendering of Elysium as a McMansion-studded suburb is amusing (it owes much to a space haven designed in 1975 by NASA and Stanford University), but its banality is further evidence of how difficult Utopian visions, even caricatures like this one, have become for filmmakers to imagine."

The beginning of â€œElysiumâ€ù comes on like gangbusters, and at first itâ€™s fun to be swept up in a movie like this, riding shotgun with the swooping camera moves and feeling the dread creep in with each of the scoreâ€™s brassy blares (harbingers of doom like those in â€œInceptionâ€ù). As the weapons start firing and the blood begins running, itâ€™s hard not to wonder, though, if itâ€™s Mr. Blomkamp who couldnâ€™t find a genuinely fresh exit strategy or whether, as this summerâ€™s screen conflagrations suggest, itâ€™s the big studios that have given up on Utopia."

When Patsy innocently unties Lindaâ€™s bikini top, Linda demurs. Donâ€™t be such a prude, Patsy teases. In most other stories, this line as well as Lindaâ€™s resistance might register as insignificant, but here it initiates a counter-narrative that runs quietly through the first half and rises to a roar in the second. Adding foreboding piquancy, as well as psychological clues, is a looming, oversize statue of the Virgin Mary and the weirdly twinned figure of Lindaâ€™s rampaging, hectoring mother, Dorothy Boreman (Sharon Stone, simmering with dark hair and scowl)."

(The real Boreman wrote several memoirs, including â€œOrdeal.â€ù) Structurally, the story they tell resembles an 18th-century tale of sexual liberation (like the Marquis de Sadeâ€™s novel, â€œJulietteâ€ù) that becomes a tale of exploitation (like Sadeâ€™s â€œJustineâ€ù), with Boremanâ€™s later marriage to Larry Marchiano, her children and anti-pornography activism little more than a coda. Mostly, itâ€™s girl meets pimp-husband (an excellent Peter Sarsgaard as Chuck Traynor), who ushers her into the world of sexual pleasure and pornography that becomes a hell. Itâ€™s a story that, as the porn director Candida Royalle once said of â€œOrdeal,â€ù has more to do with domestic abuse than pornography."

Itâ€™s perhaps inevitable that they seem happier when nothing yet feels at stake, including during the production of â€œDeep Throat.â€ù (The excellent troika of Hank Azaria, Chris Noth and Bobby Cannavale enliven the proceedings.)

Once the bombs stop, if temporarily, the woman begins to speak, leaning over her apparently comatose husband and asking, â€œCan you hear me?â€ù It isnâ€™t a simple question even in most close relationships.

Every so often both the camera and the woman venture outdoors, wandering into the forlorn, dusty streets among the ruined homes and emaciated dogs.

Mr. Stern and Mr. Whiteley pile up Jobsâ€™s multitudes: he screams and smirks, the score rises triumphantly only to ease and darken.

The genius of â€œThe Butlerâ€ù lies in the sly and self-assured way it connects public affairs to private experience. Early on, Cecil Gaines, the character loosely based on Mr. Allen, is taught that he, like every other African-American who wants to survive in a white-dominated world, must have two faces. This practical advice is an echo of W. E. B. Du Boisâ€™s idea, articulated in â€œThe Souls of Black Folk,â€ù of the â€œdouble consciousnessâ€ù at the heart of the black experience in America. â€œWe wear the mask that grins and liesâ€ù is how the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar bitterly summarized the duplicity imposed by post-Civil War white supremacy on its emancipated but disenfranchised victims."

Nor does it neatly divide whites into snarling bigots and paragons of tolerance. There are certainly instances of raw prejudice and of sincere decency, but the presidents are complex and contradictory creatures. Lyndon B. Johnson (Liev Schreiber) spews racial slurs even as he prepares to sign the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Lincoln. Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman) treats the black White House staff more fairly than any of his predecessors â€” his wife, Nancy (yes, that is Jane Fonda) invites Cecil to a state dinner â€” but fails to grasp the moral enormity of South African apartheid.

And so the camera follows him into the kitchens and back rooms of the White House and revels in his easy, irreverent camaraderie with Carter Wilson (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and James Holloway (Lenny Kravitz), fellow butlers who become his close friends."

Often in the company of his classmate and sometime girlfriend, Carol (Yaya Alafia), he sits at a segregated Woolworthâ€™s lunch counter, on a bus full of Freedom Riders, in the Lorraine Motel on the day of the Rev.

Mr. Daniels measures how much of this work has been accomplished, at what cost and with what enemies and allies, and never lets us suppose that it is finished. He dedicates â€œThe Butlerâ€ù to â€œthe heroes of the civil rights movementâ€ù and leaves no doubt that people like the title character â€” including the unsung maids, Pullman porters, janitors and kitchen workers who toiled far from the White House â€” belong in that category.

They get each otherâ€™s jokes and never tire of each otherâ€™s company. Daily lunch companions, they often extend the nightly busmanâ€™s holiday of after-work beer-drinking until closing time. They snuggle up in booths and couches, sometimes dozing off, but more like puppies in a box than lovers in bed."

The genre depends on tidy mathematics, a calculus of desire that produces the same result every time. Mr. Swanberg, a prolific investigator of the makeshift mores of the young, prefers a kind of fractal geometry, leaving room for contingency, confusion and randomness in his search for emotional and behavioral truth. In the past, his explorations have sometimes been waylaid by formal sloppiness and a leering, distracting commitment to filming women without clothes. Still, he has become an undisputed expert on the group activities (filmmaking among them) of post-collegiate urban white people, and a pioneer of the cinematic manner that may define the current generation of 20- and 30-somethings."

Mr. Swanbergâ€™s camera weaves through bodies at rest, at work and at the bar in no particular hurry, and his script captures the idioms of men and women who are equally inclined to waste words and to say very little.

Predictably, â€œThe Grandmasterâ€ù is, given this filmmaker, less a straight biographical portrait of Ip Man and more an exploration of opposing forces like loyalty and love, horizontal and vertical, and the geometry of bodies moving through space and time.

You donâ€™t learn the names of Ip Manâ€™s children, yet you do learn those of his martial arts adversaries, the good, bad and ugly who stand in for a divided China.

In another, he uses metal chopsticks to ward off a razor. His greatest opponent will be the old grandmasterâ€™s daughter, Gong Er (Ziyi Zhang), a heartbreaking beauty who makes a loud entrance in Western-style shoes.

When, for instance, Ip Man sits motionless while everyone rushes around him in fast motion, as if he and they were living in different time signatures, itâ€™s an expression of radical isolation thatâ€™s so vivid it lingers after the scene ends. Through these different, obviously artificial speed settings, Mr. Wong isnâ€™t simply showing you a man alone or a memorable picture of loneliness; he is also suggesting that this is what the experience of isolation feels like.

Pino Donaggioâ€™s vivid, sensuous, perversely jaunty musical score emphasizes the almost campy artifice of the drama, which is played out by actors who rarely seem to believe what they are saying."

Its late embrace of cop-show proceduralism left viewers (this one, in any case) feeling cheated of a more probing, more daring movie.

The imposing white structure, which overlooks the Seine in the 16th arrondissement in Paris, an easy walk from the Eiffel Tower, is home to Radio France, the state broadcasting company, which has seven networks and many more stations. Designed by the architect Henry Bernard and known as La Maison de la Radio, the building functions as something of a geographic placeholder in Mr. Philibertâ€™s movie, which offers fleeting peeks at the news-gathering worker bees, velvet-voiced on-air personalities and visiting luminaries who congregate inside it."

These headline fragments temporally situate you, which is helpful, because Mr. Philibert shuns conventional nonfiction signposts like voice-overs and on-screen information. Instead, using a stationary camera (the absence of jiggle is nice) and a fly-on-the-wall approach, he inserts you into rooms, next to bodies and among voices. None of these are identified while theyâ€™re on camera, but if you know what the veteran screenwriter Jean-Claude CarriÃ¨re looks like, or if you stick around to read the end credits, you will know heâ€™s one of the guests who pass through. A somewhat jolly Umberto Eco shows up in a studio at one point, too."

This synthetic time frame gives all the material a narrative shape, turning snippets from different weeks, months and broadcasts into a day-in-the-life story. As in many such stories, there are also leading men and women, along with the supporting cast members and guest stars like Mr. Eco. Among the most vivid main characters is Marguerite Gateau, who sits behind a console, at times with her head somewhat cocked â€” as if she were picking up frequencies the rest of us canâ€™t hear â€” and directs performers for a dramatic program on the subtlest line readings, guiding them with admirable serenity past fumbled words."

Yet the precise nature of Ms. Rabot-Pinsonâ€™s job remains frustratingly unclear. Does she make assignments, write the news, edit copy? Who knows? Itâ€™s similarly unclear if Ms. Gateau only directs performers or if she also casts them. Mr. Philibertâ€™s intimate, calm style can be very appealing, as can be his patience, both of which were crucial to turning his 2002 documentary, â€œTo Be and to Haveâ€ù â€” which follows a class of schoolchildren and their teacher over a year â€” into an epic of human emotion."

This interlude, however, seems over before it has begun. And, as Mr. Philibert continues to pop in and out of different studios, in and out of the building, flitting from one face to the other, it feels as if he were searching for a story that never emerges. In an article that ran in The Guardian in June 2012, Mr. Philibert mentioned that he was then working on this documentary. â€œThe strength of radio is linked to its absence of images, and thatâ€™s what attracted me to the subject,â€ù he wrote. â€œItâ€™s a paradox: a film about radio.

This scarcely matters to Ms. Fidell, who has a fine eye but not the makings of a feature-length movie here and, it quickly becomes clear, isnâ€™t interested in this relationship or the moral, ethical and legal issues it raises.

The implication is that he would emerge from the affair just fine, which effectively makes him a prop in what becomes a portrait of a psychological meltdown. To that narrative end, Ms. Fidell tries to suggest a sense of Dianaâ€™s internal weather, notably her isolation, which is telegraphed with many shots of her by herself, literally, or alone in the frame.

The series director and writer (sometimes co-writer), David Twohy, has smartly gone back to genre basics with this installment, which serves as an effective reboot. Gone are the silly costumes and wigs, the overstuffed plot and exotic-sounding villains like the Necromongers, the religious fanatics that Mr. Dieselâ€™s character, the escaped convict more formally known as Richard B.

Riddick even undergoes a ritual purification, emerging from a pool of liquid like Martin Sheenâ€™s psychotic warrior in â€œApocalypse Now.â€ù Mr. Twohyâ€™s reference to â€œApocalypse Nowâ€ù can be read as just another ceremonial nod at a cinematic touchstone, one that seeks to suggest affinity merely through quotation.

Howard Hughes â€” who fretted about how Russellâ€™s bust should be deployed in â€œMacao,â€ù an amusing 1952 Hollywood noir made by his studio â€” might have approved.

Cinephiles and festivalgoers may recognize their names from previous collaborations like â€œTo Die Like a Man,â€ù a playfully overbaked melodrama about an ill-fated preoperative transsexual. Candy has serious problems, too, a man calling himself Guerra da Mata explains in voice-over shortly after â€œThe Last Time I Saw Macaoâ€ù gets going. Thatâ€™s ostensibly why, after a lengthy absence, he has returned to Macau, as itâ€™s also spelled, that in-between place in which â€œstrange and scary thingsâ€ù happen and nothing is as it first seems."

It remains unclear if this voice and face actually belong to one of the filmmakers, a confusion that increases when a second male voice (presumably that of Mr. Rodrigues) chimes in on the soundtrack. As this fragmentation suggests, the on-screen figure of Guerra da Mata is purposely an abstraction, more narrative code than character. Mostly, he serves as a visual marker, something to hold onto as the two voices offer up streams of personal memories, geopolitical observations, offbeat asides and paranoid neo-noir musings that, after a fashion, give essayistic shape to the movieâ€™s overextended 85 minutes."

Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Macau became, like Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China in the late 1990s. China maintains its claim on Macau through a concept known as â€œone country, two systems,â€ù a bifurcation that, in â€œThe Last Time I Saw Macao,â€ù is embodied by Candy (as a transsexual but also as a Jane Russell impersonator) and echoed by other doublings, like that of the tag-team voice-over and fact-fiction form. As the narrators switch on and off and even talk to each other, the story of Macau and of Candy â€” these two divided and contested bodies, both gaudy, glorious and simmering with intrigue â€” increasingly comes into play."

This woman plays a crucial role in Candyâ€™s story, which Guerra da Mata tries to piece together like a film-noir detective. (Hollywood movies, the filmmakers suggest, are also a type of colonialism.) As he roams around trying to find Candy, he pauses here and there, the camera capturing documentary images of Macauâ€™s citizens and visitors, its wild dogs and feral cats. Like a lot of classic heroes, he is mapping a place as he looks for a dame, uncovering her traces among the ghosts of the past, the banalities of the present and the uncertainties of the future."

Enzo Ferrari, the Ferrari founder (who was called the Saturn, or devourer of his children, because of the fatalities during his tenure), might have been more important to Formula One than any driver, but romances like â€œRushâ€ù donâ€™t belong to the owners: they belong to the workers, the grim ones and the smiling ones, the ones with the death wish and the ones with the gushers of Champagne."

Heâ€™s a ravishing mess, and his effect on the room, which goes immediately silent, is unmistakably erotic. â€œHunt, James Hunt,â€ù he announces, echoing a familiar line. Before long, a nurse is at once dressing his wound and undressing the rest of him, a seduction thatâ€™s as much about the audienceâ€™s pleasure as that of the characters on screen. Best known for playing the comic-book hero Thor, Mr. Hemsworth is prettier than the all-too-real man he plays in â€œRush.â€ù Yet this surplus of beauty works for the role because the actor, who holds the screen with the unconscious physical confidence of the truly lovely, looks like the star that James Hunt became."

Itâ€™s also about work, about finding â€œa drive,â€ù as they say in racing, and keeping it, even after machines and people spectacularly fail. Lauda, whoâ€™s seen buying his way into racing with loans (his family didnâ€™t support his passion), isnâ€™t a natural physical specimen or showman like Hunt. Yet one of the movieâ€™s deepening pleasures is how, as the story slyly shifts from one man to the other, it peels back the arrogance encasing Lauda, whoâ€™s so abrasive that itâ€™s hard not to root against him, even as Mr. BrÃ_hlâ€™s dexterous, textured performance pulls you close."

Every so often, Hunt and Lauda come briefly down to earth, as does the movie, especially whenever they resume their roles in their domestic dramas (with Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara).

Jane Lynch, who plays a woman studying children of divorce, also elevates her scenes. But Mr. Zicherman needs a better crew, some time with the Criterion Collection and a fresher story, one perhaps not plucked from his own life.

(Dyslexics, it would seem, can do well in professions that rely on oral and memory skills.) Mr. Hubbell also interviews researchers who are breaking ground in the science of reading, educators applying the new methods and students who have benefited. As this upbeat film concludes, dyslexics untie!"

Most of the villagers turn away from Dahai and his protests, laughing and grimacing by turns, seemingly resigned to what some might be called fate.

Mr. Jia has long blurred the line between fiction and nonfiction through his use of digital cinematography, which helps convey a sense of documentarylike immediacy, and through real locations and nonprofessional performers working alongside trained actors. In his movies, characters feel as if they live in a world thatâ€™s so rapidly changing, so unsettled and destabilizing, that it seems the very ground under them is collapsing along with innumerable social, political and aesthetic frameworks."

Her story opens soon before she gives her lover an ultimatum; in return, he gives her a knife that will find its mark.

When Dahai picks up a shotgun in the first section, thereâ€™s a pan to the image of a tiger, and you hear a roar, as if Dahai were possessed by the animal, one of the 12 in the Chinese Zodiac. In the third section, Xiao Yu is beaten and takes shelter in a surrealistic sideshow in which â€œholy snakesâ€ù slither around a young womanâ€™s feet.

At the same time, the transformation of these characters into archetypes, like Mr. Jiaâ€™s references to Chinese opera, implies there are other stories, forms and beliefs that China can embrace beyond those represented either by a Mao statue or a private plane. Time is running out, as suggested late in the movie, when a young man and woman slip some live goldfish into a stream, enacting a Buddhist ritual in which captive animals are released to encourage compassion. The animals of course need to be trapped so they can be freed, a dreadful paradox that these two imprisoned people will never experience."

But the main challenge facing the director, Alfonso CuarÃ_n (who wrote the script with his son JonÃ¡s), is not visualizing the unimaginable so much as overcoming the audienceâ€™s assumption that weâ€™ve seen it all before. After more than 50 years, space travel has lost some of its luster, and movies are partly to blame for our jadedness. It has been a long time since a filmmaker conjured the awe of â€œ2001: A Space Odysseyâ€ù or the terror of â€œAlienâ€ù or captured afresh the spooky wonder of a trip outside our native atmosphere."

The usual genre baggage has been jettisoned: there are no predatory extraterrestrials, no pompous flights of allegory, no extravagant pseudo-epic gestures. Instead, there is a swift and buoyant story of the struggle for survival in terrible, rapidly changing circumstances. Cosmic questions about our place in the universe are not so much avoided as subordinated to more pressing practical concerns. How do you outrun a storm of debris? Launch a landing module without fuel? Decipher an instruction manual in Russian or Chinese?"

Surely, though, the standard for a movie like this one is not realism but coherence. Every true outlaw has a code.

Kowalski, generally an irreverent joker, pauses to savor the sun over the Ganges, and you may find yourself picking out other geographical details. Look, thereâ€™s Italy, and the Nile Valley.

The reason for that is summed up in the title, which names an obvious missing element. Nothing in the movie â€” not hand tools or chess pieces, human bodies or cruise-ship-size space stations â€” rests within a stable vertical or horizontal plane.

These and other stars of the New York punk scene are played by actors who jump around and lip sync over familiar studio versions of well-known songs. It was probably fun for Malin Akerman to pretend to sing for Blondie and for Joel David Moore to do the same for the Ramones, but it is not much fun to watch them do it. The alternative would have been worse, of course â€” no one wants to hear bad new renditions of great old tunes â€” but the impersonations fall into the uncanny valley between comedy-sketch parody and cover-band homage."

That might be one definition of a foolâ€™s errand, the primary fool being Anse Bundren, a stubborn, suspicious and toothless Mississippi farmer who insists on burying his wife, Addie, in her hometown. Another definition might be the attempt to turn Faulknerâ€™s splintered, lyrical book into a movie. In this case the fool would be James Franco, who directed and stars in the first film adaptation of a book that has long been considered unfilmable."

His â€œAs I Lay Dyingâ€ù is certainly ambitious, but it is also admirably modest. The script, written by Mr. Franco with Matt Rager, tries to pare Faulknerâ€™s multivoiced narrative to a manageable essence. The book is a series of fragmented monologues spoken by Addie, her friends and kin and people her burial party encounters on its journey. (The shortest chapter is a single sentence, uttered by Anse and Addieâ€™s youngest son, Vardaman: â€œMy mother is a fish.â€ù) Some of these are pared away, some shoehorned into dialogue, and others rendered in voice-over. The frequent use of a split screen â€” sometimes effective, sometimes distracting â€” emphasizes the isolation of the characters, even as they are connected by blood, duty and desire."

In any case, he is a complicated fellow, an odd blend of ridiculousness and nobility, played by Tim Blake Nelson with sharp eyes and a slack jaw. Mr. Nelson has the most strenuous job of acting, since Anse is the biggest talker in the family, but it is Beth Grant as Addie, a dead woman staring straight into the camera and speaking her mind, who registers the strongest impression. Ms. Oâ€™Reilly is anxious and watchful, while Mr. Parrack captures Cashâ€™s stoicism and Mr. Marshall-Green, Jewelâ€™s hotheadedness. Mr. Franco, as the most inwardly troubled and alert of the siblings, coasts a little on the assumed sympathy of the audience. Either that or his movie-star magnetism gets in the way of his efforts and diffidence, but at any rate his Darl is blurrier than the rest."

All the children pay a terrible price as they obey their father and honor their mother, and their composite story is a catalog of material and moral losses. A foot, a horse, freedom, dignity and innocence are among the sacrifices. And while the Bundrens are poor country people, there is something almost Greek about their fates, as if they were a House of Atreus transplanted to a cabin in the Yoknapatawpha backwoods."

The ship, with an unarmed crew of just 20 sailors, was hauling tons of cargo in hundreds of containers, including food from the United Nations World Food Program designated for African countries. To the Somalis, the ship apparently looked like a floating jackpot.

Inside, Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) is packing up and checking his route.

Phillips and the crew dodge the skiffs by increasing their speed (the real shipâ€™s speed topped out at 18 knots, or about 21 miles per hour) and shifting course to churn up destabilizing waves. Badly rocked, their jerry-built engines sputtering, the skiffs turn back, but the next day, one returns with four heavily armed Somali men.

Thereâ€™s something so unforced about him that it can seem as if heâ€™s not delivering a performance, just being Tom Hanks.

Later, these extremes accentuate the paradoxes of the story â€” the tiny Somalis scrambling aboard an enormous American ship â€” that grow more pointed and political, as when a group of hugely muscled Navy personnel arrive and begin gearing up for a finale in which there seem to be many Goliaths but no David."

The big men with the big guns do their part, but the skin-prickling, carnal excitement that almost inevitably comes with certain types of screen violence never manifests, replaced instead by dread, anxiety, a shaking man and whole a lot of blood.

She had just taken a splashy blood bath in Brian De Palmaâ€™s 1976 horror freakout â€œCarrie,â€ù and then settled in for what looked like the big sleep. Stephen Kingâ€™s tormented teenager proved a restless soul, though, and returned in a 2002 television movie and a short-lived 1988 Broadway musical that was revived off Broadway again in 2012. Now sheâ€™s back, as they like to say in movie ads, in a fine, largely faithful screen remake, directed by Kimberly Peirce that stars ChloÃ« Grace Moretz as its goddess of gore. Itâ€™s hard to keep a franchise crazy down, especially one that can be retrofitted for todayâ€™s fears."

Thereâ€™s an enormous cross hanging above the bed, and some burning candles off to the side add a nice Gothic touch to what quickly becomes a very weird scene as Margaret â€” thrashing, screaming and to her great and evident surprise â€” squirts out a baby. After giving the infant nestled between her legs a quick look, she pulls out an alarmingly oversized pair of scissors and, whoosh, goes for the kill. But something stops her (divine or narrative intervention), and instead she embraces Baby Carrie, a child to hold, protect, mother and smother until death do them part."

Margaret, as the opener suggests, is a religious fanatic of ambiguous denomination who has an unpleasant habit of mortifying her own flesh by, say, gouging her pale thighs with sharp, unsubtly phallic objects. Fearful of the fallen world, or rather its effect on her too mortal flesh, she keeps Carrie on a tight leash and in modest clothing. A seeming prisoner of her motherâ€™s madness, Carrie finds no refuge at school, where the other girls taunt her, including in the shower, where, after she gets her period for the first time, sheâ€™s pelted with tampons and chants of â€œplug it upâ€ù by the likes of Chris (Portia Doubleday) and Sue (Gabriella Wilde)."

Ms. Peirce plays up the storyâ€™s religious themes and Carrieâ€™s burgeoning power as she discovers her telekinetic gifts, even as the dread of the female body that deepens Mr. De Palmaâ€™s version somehow goes missing. This â€œCarrieâ€ù has its share of terrors, certainly, partly because of the seeming timelessness of its deeper, more resonant themes. Although now, when Carrie â€” one of the more memorable screen victims of bullying â€” locks the doors of the school gym and does her bloody worst, itâ€™s a good guess that it wonâ€™t be the movie that you will be thinking about, but recent headlines."

Daniel is initially impressed by Assangeâ€™s courage and idealism and dazzled by his charisma.

Itâ€™s also where the existential reality of what it meant to be enslaved, hour after hour, decade after decade, generation after generation, is laid bare, at times on the flayed backs of Eppsâ€™s human property, including that of his brutalized favorite, Patsey (Lupita Nyongâ€™o). Mr. Fassbender, skittish and weirdly spiderlike, grabs your attention with curdled intensity. Heâ€™s so arresting that at first it seems as if the performance will soon slip out of Mr. McQueenâ€™s control, and that the character will become just another irresistibly watchable, flamboyant heavy. Movie villainy is so easy, partly because it allows actors to showboat, but also because a lot of filmmakers canâ€™t resist siding with power."

These are rightly hard to watch and bring to mind the startling moment in â€œMaus,â€ù Art Spiegelmanâ€™s cartoon opus about the Holocaust, in which he asks his â€œshrinkâ€ù to explain what it felt like to be in Auschwitz. â€œBoo!

Ms. Noujaimâ€™s sympathies are clearly with those who refer to themselves as â€œrevolutionariesâ€ù â€” a word that comes to signify resistance to both the Brotherhood and the military â€” but she is hardly blind to their limitations. The revolutionaries are able to compel the worldâ€™s attention and sympathy, and to risk life and limb in defiance of authority, but they have neither the organizational discipline nor the strategic ability to assume and exercise power.

It concludes on a note of resolve grounded in the acknowledgment that historical change can be a long, slow process.

He may be trying to emphasize the normalcy of the scene by keeping her under wraps. Yet, as Diana walks into a hall, pointedly turns toward the camera and then enters an elevator, where surveillance imagery carries a foreboding time stamp, Aug. 31, 1997, it seems increasingly evident that heâ€™s trying to pump drama into a story that will soon end in off-screen tragedy.

After its opening walkabout, the story shifts to two years earlier, when Diana and Prince Charles are already separated. Now ensconced in Kensington Palace in London, with a fairly modest retinue, she is struggling, very much alone, to find her place. (Her sons were often at boarding school.) She meets Hasnat (an appealing, low-key Naveen Andrews, paunched-up and deglammed) when she visits a friend in the hospital.

Stephen Jeffreyâ€™s script covers the arc of the relationship â€” its tentative beginning and predictable complications â€” which unfolded in private, even as Diana lived out loud.

In scene after scene, he and Ms. Watts â€” whose face delicately expresses competing emotions, as despair turns to hope, and sincerity battles guile â€” make Dianaâ€™s crushing loneliness palpable, lived-in and real.

Nebraska is a roomy state, and Mr. Payne, born and raised in Omaha, has set three of his previous features at least partly in it (â€œCitizen Ruth,â€ù â€œElectionâ€ù and â€œAbout Schmidtâ€ù). But to my ear, at least, a specific Springsteenian echo announces itself early and deepens as this movie winds from Billings, Mont., across the Badlands and toward Lincoln, stopping for a while in the tiny and fictitious hamlet of Hawthorne. Beyond the folky intonations of the fiddle-and-guitar waltz (by Mark Orton) that accompanies the opening images (shot by Phedon Papamichael) and beyond the bleak beauty of the images themselves, there is something in the movie that brings to mind the haunting last line of the albumâ€™s title track: â€œSir I guess thereâ€™s just a meanness in this world.â€ù"

The only consequential violence in Mr. Payneâ€™s â€œNebraska,â€ù based on a script by Rob Nelson, is a punch in the face that has been well earned by the recipient. (Lately Mr. Payne seems to allow himself one or two such righteous blows per movie: Think of George Clooney clocking Matthew Lillard in â€œThe Descendantsâ€ù and Sandra Oh busting Thomas Haden Churchâ€™s nose with a motorcycle helmet in â€œSideways.â€ù) This is a comedy, with plenty of acutely funny lines, a handful of sharp sight gags and a few minutes of pure, perfect madcap. But a grim, unmistakable shadow falls across its wintry landscape. The world it depicts, a small-town America that is fading, aging and on the verge of giving up, is blighted by envy, suspicion and a general failure of good will. Hard times are part of the picture, and so are hard people."

The easy (and almost by definition hypocritical) knock against Mr. Payne is that he is just another coastal snob poking fun at the good folks in the heartland, but the emotions that drive â€œNebraskaâ€ù are much more complicated than condescension. There is palpable nostalgia here, and real affection for the plain speech and democratic manners of the rural Midwest. There is also a strong current of anger, directed through the characters and at them, though it almost never rises to the surface. If it did, the Great Plains, which once sat at the bottom of a prehistoric ocean, might be flooded with tears of melodramatic rage. So much betrayal, so much disappointment, so much wasted potential and thwarted love."

Her husband breaks the bad news to Jep, and together they weep, an emotional torrent which â€” in an elegiac illustration of Mr. Sorrentinoâ€™s associative method â€” initially evokes Jepâ€™s memories of the dead woman, whom he watches while swimming, and then comes to a watery culmination with the men embracing in a hard rain."

But legends can be easier to sell than people, which may explain why so many of this movieâ€™s talking heads testify to Pageâ€™s legacy as if the case still needed to be made. Some of the witnesses for the defense, like Greg Theakston, who was instrumental to the 1980s Page revival with his zine â€œThe Betty Pages,â€ù have something to say. Others, including a few of the glamour-pusses who pop up in some shoddy looking material shot at a gallery event, tend to talk about Page as an abstraction, a brand, a cartoon with bangs and breasts â€” all of which Page became, of course, even as the real woman turned into one indelibly tough old broad."
