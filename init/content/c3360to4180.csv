Among Mr. Tarantino’s achievements has been his successful argument that the maligned and neglected B movies of the past should be viewed with fresh eyes and unironic respect. His own tributes to the outlaw, outsider film tradition — flamboyant in their scholarly care and in their bold originality — have suggested new ways of taking movies seriously. “Django Unchained” is unabashedly and self-consciously pulpy, with camera moves and musical cues that evoke both the cornfed westerns of the 1950s and their pastafied progeny of the next decade. (The title comes from a series of Italian action movies whose first star, Franco Nero, shows up here in a cameo.) It is digressive, jokey, giddily brutal and ferociously profane. But it is also a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism."

It is the Fourth of July, and Kelly’s search lands her at a wild party on Staten Island, where the sheer grossness rivals the teenage bacchanal in “Project X.”"

Beautifully captured by Jo Yeong-jik, its images mesmerize despite a despicable central character. (“Anyone you want to kill?” he asks the woman, by way of a gift.) And though more horrors are suggested than shown, the film’s final moments will linger longer than any number of severed heads or gushing arteries."

There are a number of overt references to the past in “Man of Steel,” a title that itself summons up America’s lost industrial history. There’s even a scene in which Jor-El narrates Krypton’s rise and calamitous fall using immersive, metallic-gray images that morph and scroll across the frame like an animated version of a W.P.A. bas-relief mural."

And while the movie finally proves as much an autobiographical tale as a biographical one, Ms. Polley resists turning it into a flattering self-portrait of a young artist in search of her origins. Instead, building on the interest in narrative form that she expressed in earlier movies like “Take This Waltz,” she explores storytelling itself and the space between a life lived and its different, at times conflicting representations."

Set in contemporary Paris, it begins with the couple’s front door being breached by a group of firemen. One moves through the rooms, delicately raising a hand to his nose before throwing open several large windows. He may be trying to erase the smell that probably brought the firemen there in the first place and which has transformed this light, graceful, enviable apartment into a crypt."

Jor-El and his wife, Lara Lor-Van (the Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer), decide to rocket their child to Earth, sending him off to safety in the futuristic equivalent of Moses’ basket. Given that Superman’s creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, were Jewish, much has been written about Superman’s similarities to Moses (“el” is a Hebrew word for God), which is complicated by the character’s likeness to Jesus. (Superman’s Earth mom was originally named Mary.) Mr. Snyder, with his characteristic lack of subtlety, hits the Jesus angle amusingly hard, primarily in a later scene in which Superman — framed by a stained-glass tableau of a supplicating Jesus draped in a red robe — consults with a priest in a church. By then, the rocketing baby has become the man and given a soul-sick mien. That’s because the next time you see Kal-El after liftoff, he’s all grown up and toiling on a fishing boat off the northwest Canadian coast, a filmic ellipsis that abruptly spans decades. A beat later and he’s also shirtless and holding back a tower wobbling on a burning oil platform. And then, like Hercules who rises from his funeral pyre — having cast off his mortal body and assumed his godly form — Superman, a k a Clark Kent, is engulfed in flames. It’s a nifty, startling image, even if it transforms Mr. Cavill, a pretty man whose body has been inflated to Bluto-esque proportions, into barbecue beefcake.

But as Pat absorbs the changes and faces his own health crisis, his rage subsides."

The first encounter happens in a scaring class, when the hard-working Mike — who looks like a cross between a walking eyeball and a spit-polished Granny Smith apple — is overshadowed by Sulley, who’s arrived believing that he can coast on his family’s frightening good name.

Though Ashburn is smarter than her colleagues, she still has to endure their overt condescension and thinly veiled resentment. “No wonder she’s single,” one of them sneers after she’s just shown up a room full of men by finding hidden drugs and guns that had eluded them."

His main intention — and his great achievement, as well as Mr. Jordan’s — is to make Oscar a fully human presence, to pay him the respect of acknowledging his complexities and contradictions. The radicalism of “Fruitvale Station” lies precisely here, in its refusal to turn a man into a symbol. Nearly every black man, whether or not he is president, tends to be flattened out by popular culture and the psychopathology of everyday American life, rendered as an innocent victim, a noble warrior or a menace to society. There is a dehumanizing violence in this habit, a willed, toxic blindness that “Fruitvale Station” at once exposes and resists."

Even so, to see and hear Mr. Jay gloss over the topic of his parents on camera resonates because both the rapidity and the deadpan with which he glides over the subject seems to speak to an unhealed wound, an irreconcilable rift, however quietly. He’s far more expansive on the topic of his maternal grandfather, Max Katz, an accountant and amateur magician who introduced his grandson to a dazzling group of entertainers and future mentors. By the age of 4, little Tricky Ricky was waving a wand."

Yet while he is very much a man alone, his presence, fight against corruption and convictions rise like ghosts later in the movie, when prostitutes working in a luxurious nightclub march out in Vegas-style versions of Red Army uniforms that are perverse mockeries of Dahai’s humble coat. In some movies, such connecting moments can be quasi-mystical and sentimental (we are the world) and tend to gut whatever political point hovers in the vicinity. Here, the characters are connected by their existential reality of being alive in contemporary China."

In one scene, as Taryn kisses her aunt’s new lover in the furry shadows of a broken-down bus, the moment perfectly encapsulates the film’s theme of tentative emotional realignment and its despondent, questing tone."

It’s at once a familiar, utterly strange and deeply American story in which the period trappings long beloved by Hollywood — the paternalistic gentry with their pretty plantations, their genteel manners and all the fiddle-dee-dee rest — are the backdrop for an outrage."

His eternal theme, inspired by the Holocaust, is children and their violated innocence. (“How can somebody be so innocent?” he murmurs over a girl in a makeup chair, apropos of roughly nothing.)"

This is the Linda that the world didn’t see and who, even as her body became a public spectacle, nursed her wounds in private. She was the queen of the dirty movies, but here, as this symbolic purification suggests, her life would soon receive a cleansing."

Conceived as a one-off for a current-affairs program on Granada Television, the first film, “Seven Up!,” was a 40-minute look at the lives of 14 children from different backgrounds. Britain was changing, or so went the conventional wisdom, with postwar affluence having led the working class to adopt middle-class attitudes and lifestyles."

But as Maria and Henry’s ordeal unfolds, the film’s focus starts to feel distressingly narrow. Virtually everyone shown suffering after the tsunami is a European, Australian or American tourist, and the fact that the vast majority of the dead, injured and displaced were Asian never really registers. At one point Maria and Lucas are cared for by residents of a small village and later they are helped by Thai doctors, but these acts of selfless generosity are treated like services to which wealthy Western travelers are entitled. And the terrible effects of the tsunami on the local population are barely acknowledged."

There, scattered amid busts of heroes of the Risorgimento, the 19th-century movement for Italian unification, a smattering of Italians mill about while a group of Japanese tourists take in the sights — a view, a city, a people, a history — that, Mr. Sorrentino suggests, the natives no longer necessarily see."

Because just as the movie races toward its foregone conclusion, it also begins siphoning off the excitement it has been building up all along. The big men with the big guns do their part, but the skin-prickling, carnal excitement that almost inevitably comes with certain types of screen violence never manifests, replaced instead by dread, anxiety, a shaking man and whole a lot of blood. It’s the kind of blood that most movies avoid and that, Mr. Greengrass suggests, is what remains unseen in global traumas like this.

Mr. Cocks, a history professor at Albion College in Michigan, explains that he wasn’t impressed when he first saw “The Shining.” But it snaked under his skin, and he wondered if he’d missed something. So, “I went back to see it again, and I began to see patterns and details that I hadn’t noticed before,” he says in “Room 237.” “I kept watching the film again and again and again.” And what he found, gleaning significance from props like a typewriter, is “a deeply laid subtext that takes on the Holocaust.”"

A lover of tall tales and exploits, Isabelle is being raised by her father, the king (Ian McShane), and has been promised to the shifty Roderick (Stanley Tucci, bewigged and gaptoothed). Jack and Isabelle meet cute when he tries to scare off ruffians who hassle her while she’s watching a theatrical performance about giants. Jack’s bravery foreshadows greater deeds, much as the onstage battle between giants and men augurs a deadlier offstage fight. Isabelle’s pluck is similarly suggestive, but, alas, this isn’t “Jack and Jill, Giant Slayers.”"

Their routines are dominated by prayer, ritual observance and obedience to Jewish law, but their world does not seem narrow and austere.

Thanh tries to cope with his wife’s mood swings, but times are tough at work: His shrewish mother ostensibly helps him at the factory he runs, but the workers there — in a reaction, perhaps, to Vietnam’s growing Westernization — are in revolt. Complicating matters is their baby’s coffin, resting in their bedroom, awaiting a burial and possibly exuding a malevolent force.

Written as a monologue, it is a somewhat claustrophobic blurt of a book that, given world events, continues to feel eerily timely. The monologue is delivered by Changez — a young Pakistani university lecturer grievously, possibly violently disenchanted with the United States — to an unnamed American who may be some kind of United States operative. Seated in a Lahore restaurant, Changez essentially keeps the mystery man (and the reader) captive with his reminiscences of his American dreams and disappointments both in work and with a wealthy melancholic woman, who, rather like her country, let him down."

It’s hard to see them, but they’re there, somewhat center and to the left, waiting and then clapping. It’s curious, this impression that the characters you’re watching are in turn watching and even applauding you.

Mr. Schrader is an iconoclast who’s long worked outside the mainstream, while Mr. Ellis is a literary outsider who’s well known for igniting critical outrage. Mr. Schrader tends to focus on existential loners on the margins in films that touch on subjects like pornography and prostitution, themes that have figured in Mr. Ellis’s work. But while Mr. Schrader is a deeply serious moralist who pulls you into worlds of churning emotion, Mr. Ellis delivers shocks at a chilly, seemingly noncommittal distance. (In a 1999 interview, Mr. Schrader bemoaned that the existential hero had been supplanted by what he called the “ironic hero” — the guy who asks not “should I exist?” but “who cares?”)"

Ms. Hudson’s natural likability helps humanize the character, even when, after sliding the needle in and drifting into a haze, Gloria waves her hand at Mister.

Early on, Cecil Gaines, the character loosely based on Mr. Allen, is taught that he, like every other African-American who wants to survive in a white-dominated world, must have two faces. This practical advice is an echo of W. E. B. Du Bois’s idea, articulated in “The Souls of Black Folk,” of the “double consciousness” at the heart of the black experience in America. “We wear the mask that grins and lies” is how the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar bitterly summarized the duplicity imposed by post-Civil War white supremacy on its emancipated but disenfranchised victims."

Oshima — a salesman, 32, with a medium build, square face and caterpillar brows — was reported missing in April 1965, having disappeared, “motive and cause unknown.” The movie then jumps to a crowded street scene, and a male voice, presumably that of Imamura, asks, “Where can anyone missing be in such a small country?”"

Virtually devoid of makeup, and with her marvelously mobile body encased in thick compression garments, she’s unrecognizable as the “Dancing With the Stars” alum whose moves could make a camera sit up and beg. Here, she’s a sweet but indistinct presence with a generic prettiness and middling acting skills that lack the zing required to snag our attention."

The book is a series of fragmented monologues spoken by Addie, her friends and kin and people her burial party encounters on its journey. (The shortest chapter is a single sentence, uttered by Anse and Addie’s youngest son, Vardaman: “My mother is a fish.”) Some of these are pared away, some shoehorned into dialogue, and others rendered in voice-over.

For “12 Years a Slave,” by contrast, Mr. McQueen has largely dispensed with the conventions of art cinema to make something close to a classical narrative; in this movie, the emphasis isn’t on visual style but on Solomon and his unmistakable desire for freedom."

A grisly autopsy follows, during which Faust (the Ralph Fiennes-like Johannes Zeiler), a man of medicine like his father (who is seen stretching a patient on a rack), wonders aloud about the anatomical location of the human spirit."

His worst offense is that he has no understanding of the power, gravity and terrible beauty of violent imagery, which means he has no grasp of cinema. When Hit Girl, a k a Mindy, kills a thief, it’s with the glazed indifference that lets you know that nothing matters, not the man bleeding out at her feet, not Dave’s fleeting shock and certainly not her humanity. The moment is empty, and so is she. Even so, you may still shiver in repugnance at the scene in which a number of New York cops are slaughtered for giggles. You may also wonder who at Universal signed off on a flick in which human beings are as disposable as tissues, and teenagers shoot to kill."

In other words, he suggests an answer, something that has become scarce in the ravaged landscapes of many science-fiction movies. Mr. Blomkamp’s rendering of Elysium as a McMansion-studded suburb is amusing (it owes much to a space haven designed in 1975 by NASA and Stanford University), but its banality is further evidence of how difficult Utopian visions, even caricatures like this one, have become for filmmakers to imagine."

Frank Baum, who wrote the 1900 book “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” and its 13 follow-ups, was the son-in-law of the pioneering feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage, and her influence permeates the Oz books, which take flight with a brave girl who saves her friends and their land.

They have no parallel in the book, in which a glint of metal from inside a man’s jacket telegraphs potential violence to come. Ms. Nair’s decision to pump up Mr. Hamid’s story with genre elements partly registers as a pragmatic commercial decision, as a way to package and sell ideas about American power and subaltern identities. And there’s no question that the images and sounds of guns being cocked, as well as black S.U.V.’s hurtling heavily armed American agents through dusty Pakistani streets, add evocative jolts to the movie and its advertising."

Mr. Baumbach has explored this territory before, most notably in “Kicking and Screaming,” his first feature, released when he was in his mid-20s, almost 20 years ago. And what has been called the quarter-life crisis is a common enough theme these days."

There she discovers Sadie (Besedka Johnson), an octogenarian who, partly locked away by old age and what comes increasingly to feel like unspoken sorrow, seems every bit as isolated as Jane. Whether out of curiosity or an overburdened conscience, Jane begins wedging herself into Sadie’s life, trailing her like a sleuth or stalker."

Although these changes are said to have been approved by Mr. Wong (consent that may have more to do with contractual obligations than happy compromises), it’s too bad that the American distributor didn’t have enough faith in the audience to release the original. Even in its altered form, “The Grandmaster” is one of the truly galvanizing cinematic experiences of the year, and while I’ve seen this version twice, I am eagerly looking forward to the original in all its unfettered delirium."

He uses words like “shindee” and “flib-flub” and likes to regale (and exasperate) his cabinet with homespun parables, shaggy dog stories and bits of outhouse humor.

The southwest countryside is as appealing as the girls, who part ways after Anne says that everyone knows her brother will marry Thérèse. Six years later, and Thérèse is now played by Audrey Tautou, wearing a knit cloche and a dour expression, and walking with Anne’s brother, Bernard (Gilles Lellouche), a solid citizen with a manicured mustache and gift for the self-satisfied obvious. When he takes Thérèse’s face in his hands, it looks as if he could crush her, and so he does, or at least that’s what the director, Claude Miller, would have you believe.

As the half-built Golden Gate Bridge looms in the background, a young boy in cowboy duds and a black mask wanders into a Wild West fairground attraction, where he gazes on a taxidermied buffalo and grizzly bear, and also on an elderly American Indian with a dead crow on his head. A brass plate identifies him as “The Noble Savage in his Native Habitat.” The boy comes to know him as Tonto, and the rest of us recognize him, even under heavy prosthetic wrinkles, as Johnny Depp."
