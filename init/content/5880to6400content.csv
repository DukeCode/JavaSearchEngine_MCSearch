An experimental fiction-nonfiction hybrid, it takes place in the southwest city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province. (It was shot before  last yearâ€™s  catastrophic  earthquake.) The focus is a state-owned factory building, a ruined monument to precapitalist China, or rather to its workers, who helped turn the country into a global power. Mr. Jia managed to catch the sprawling, colloquially named Factory 420  â€”  which originally manufactured fighter aircraft engines before branching out to refrigerators and the like  â€”  as it was being demolished to make room for a mixed-use development that will spread across 3.3 million square feet, house 60,000 residents and include an eight-screen multiplex that is unlikely to show his work.",,,,,

Given his rarefied style, it was instructive to read in a recent New Yorker profile that Mr. Jia has been criticized by some Chinese intellectuals for â€œabandoning his most subversive themes.â€ù This criticism might be due to the fact that Mr. Jia, who once flew under the governmentâ€™s radar, now shoots his movies with its official approval. Or that the state-owned company that redeveloped the factory also helped pay for â€œ24 City.â€ù Whatever the case, Mr. Jia doesnâ€™t seem to have sold out for the stateâ€™s blessing, at least as far as  this Westerner can tell.",,,,,

His earlier films, including â€œThe Worldâ€ù (2004), a fiction about workers at a theme  park that features small-scale replicas of the Pyramids along with the twin towers, can scarcely be called mainstream. Yet these documentary-inflected works, with their drifting characters and ambiguities, also fit into a recognizable art-cinema continuum.

Mr. Jiaâ€™s own movie  â€”  he shifted from celluloid to digital video a while ago  â€”  includes four monologues, delivered by professional actors, which are interspersed with five interviews with nonactors, most of whom worked in the factory. Mixed in with these true and false witnesses are images  of the closing and derelict factory and of the city beyond.

But I was uncertain about most of the other people, even though Mr. Jia does include images of some workers on old identity cards.

In the end, the deep emotions they stir up  â€”  the actress Lv Liping delivers a harrowing story about a lost child  â€”  constitute another kind of monument to the workers of Factory 420.

Mr. Coppola has cited Elia Kazanâ€™s films like â€œOn the Waterfrontâ€ù as one inspiration for his new movieâ€™s striking, high-contrast visuals, an influence that also reverberates in the brooding tensions between the brothers who at times bring to mind those in Kazanâ€™s â€œEast of Eden.â€ù While shooting â€œThe Godfather,â€ù it seems worth mentioning, Mr. Coppola had nightmares that he was going to be replaced by Kazan.",,,,,

The family theme echoes even here; in that eccentric 1955 classic, Mitchum plays a preacher who tracks the two children of a woman heâ€™s married and murdered. The patriarchal damage in Mr. Coppolaâ€™s movie is somewhat subtler, the work of a man, Carlo Tetrocini (Klaus Maria Brandauer), who has crippled the dreams of his own brother, another composer (Mr. Brandauer, heavily disguised), and the sanity of his older son.

Tetro, we discover, is a genius or would be if he ever completed his work, an aside thatâ€™s funny and tragic though itâ€™s unclear if itâ€™s meant to be both.

Born in an age of corsets and legalized prejudice (1873-1954), Colette scandalized society with her colorful life, lovers of both sexes and demimonde characters. Her inspirations were artists not of the pen but of the bedroom, women whose idea of the bottom line, to quote the critic Judith Thurman, â€œwas 50 thousand a year and a villa of oneâ€™s own â€” with a big garden, a great chef, and a pretty boy.â€ù",,,,,

Over her long career as a professional coquette, LÃ©a has reaped ample rewards and seemingly few serious regrets. Six years before the novel opens, she also acquired a much-younger lover, the fatal beauty of the bookâ€™s title â€” â€œa graceful demonâ€ù in Coletteâ€™s words, played by the striking Rupert Friend â€” whose appeal for her is as openly maternal as it is unabashedly erotic.

At other times, you see the steeliness that comes with any sustained and successful movie career.

Yet in flattering Ms. Pfeiffer, he also ends up insulting her talent. Even a lingering close-up of her face, which is meant to reveal how ChÃ©ri suddenly sees LÃ©a in the harsh light of day, backfires and not only because, like most Hollywood stars of her age, Ms. Pfeiffer looks all of 40. Thereâ€™s something poignant about the image of this actress sitting in a pool of sunlight without a smile or trace of visible makeup.

Kateâ€™s disease was diagnosed when she was a toddler, and to save her life her parents, Sara (Cameron Diaz) and Brian (Jason Patric), conceived another daughter, Anna (Abigail Breslin), who was genetically engineered to be a perfect donor of blood, marrow and whatever else Kate might need.

Shot in high-definition digital by a filmmaker whoâ€™s helping change the way movies look, it revisits with meticulous detail and convulsions of violence a short, frantic period in the life and bank-robbing times of John Dillinger, an Indiana farm boy turned Depression outlaw, played by a low-voltage Johnny Depp. Much of what makes the movie pleasurable is the vigor with which it restages our familiar romance with period criminals, a perennial affair. But what also makes it more than the sum of its spectacular shootouts is the ambivalence about this romance that seeps into the filmmaking, steadily darkening the skies and draining the story of easy thrills.",,,,,

In the most startling shot, Mr. Mann places the camera right next to the fallen man, pointing it up at Dillingerâ€™s dark, ominous figure as he almost blots out that blue sky.

This is the stuff of legends, of shoot-â€™em-ups and matinee gangsters with jaunty smiles. Mr. Mann loves this apparition of calculated bravura and initially he frames the first few heists as seamlessly choreographed set pieces.

At first  the bureauâ€™s young chief, J. Edgar Hoover (a terrific Billy Crudup, his neck thickened and delivery clipped), ignored Dillinger, deeming him a state problem.

Banks made for easy targets, logistically and otherwise, and, as the writer Bryan Burrough points out in a book about Americaâ€™s inaugural war on crime, these outlaws took advantage of the publicâ€™s hatred of those recently failed institutions.

If he doesnâ€™t fully succeed, itâ€™s because he knows that the gangsterâ€™s rakish smile is at once a fiction of cinema and one of its great, irresistible lies.

Itâ€™s a quiet, quietly haunting scene in which the surgeons, their faces knotted and gray, struggle to find a way to tell a 23-year-old that sheâ€™s going to die. These men perform miracles, but they are also agonizingly human.",,,,,

Itâ€™s telling that when Mr. Apatow isnâ€™t trying to get in touch with Georgeâ€™s (gentler, kinder) feelings, the movie pleasurably pops. The scenes, for instance, of Ira and his greedily ambitious friends, the globular Leo (Jonah Hill) and ramrod-straight Mark (Jason Schwartzman), who together form a walking, talking exclamation point, have a lightness of touch and palpable warmth. Theyâ€™re also seamlessly, easily comic because of the push-pull between the friendsâ€™ ambition and camaraderie, their hopes for one another and their competitive ruthlessness.  Watching â€œFunny People,â€ù you get the sense that Mr. Apatow, one of the most successful filmmakers working in Hollywood, is very happy. Bummer.",,,,,

In many respects the same holds true for â€œCold Souls,â€ù an ambitious, elegantly shot, tonally cool first feature written and directed by Sophie Barthes that shows hints of Stanley Kubrick and Charlie Kaufman both.

But something is troubling Paul, gnawing at him and eroding his performance, or so he believes. Itâ€™s not a tragedy, the theater director (Michael Tucker) kindly reminds him after Paul brings rehearsals to an abrupt, angrily frustrated stop. Yet the play isnâ€™t a comedy either.  Itâ€™s something in between, something like life, a blurring that thwarts Paul. His already rounded shoulders and bent head droop even further.

In this she has great help from the dryly funny David Strathairn as Dr. Flintstein, who runs the company with his assistant, Stephanie (an underused, decorative Lauren Ambrose). With little ado Dr. Flintstein persuades Paul to relinquish his soul in a swift, painless process that extracts it as if it were a zit.

Ms. Barthes more or less comes to the same conclusion, but she complicates her film in ways that suggest she has trouble accepting such a seemingly modest (say, chickpea-size) conclusion. And so, early on, she introduces Paulâ€™s narrative counterpart, Nina (Dina Korzun), a beautiful melancholic who smuggles black-market Russian souls into the United States. Like Paul, Nina is a performer (she passes through immigration using  counterfeit fingerprints) and overburdened with soul, in this case the traces of smuggled souls that linger in her memory like the flickering images from barely remembered old movies.",,,,,

There he finds a soap-opera star who yearns for the soul of Al Pacino (a very good Katheryn Winnick) and witnesses desperate people selling the most intimate part of their being. He also looks into his own soul, and while it brings tears to his eyes, it, much like the Russian subplot, proves disappointingly banal, which might be true to life but is an artistic letdown. In this attractive, smart-enough, finally un-brave movie Ms. Barthes peeks at the dark comedy of the soul only to beat a quick, pre-emptive retreat.",,,,,

Wearing a permanently baffled expression and a succession of androgynous jeans and hoodies, she shuffles through the movie without acting ability or, it seems, basic survival skills. Lost in the aisles of a supermarket, she and Mr. Cera  (who have been romantically linked in real life) are as helpless as kittens;  you would think neither had seen packaged food before.

The softly smudged field of grass that surrounds Sosukeâ€™s house like a blanket is striking partly because you can see the touch of the human hand in each blade.

Itâ€™s instructive that when the book isnâ€™t drooping under the weight of its metaphor (Men! Theyâ€™re always leaving!), it makes room for pleasure amid the trauma.

Seeing the dramatic potential in this nonmeeting, Mr. Hibbert worked with them on the script, though the two didnâ€™t meet. Writing a fictional version of their lives might have helped them.

The filmâ€™s opening sequence, much of which takes place inside the restricted confines of a farmhouse room, is a marvel of choreographed camera movement and tightly coordinated performances.

Set against a sweeping stretch of green French countryside in 1941, it opens with a dairy farmer, Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet), chopping wood. As his ax looms ominously in the foreground of the shot, he readies himself for some unwelcome German visitors. Colonel Landa, nicknamed the Jew Hunter, has come looking for hidden prey, a task for which he is, as he explains in a long verbal jag, eminently suitable. Because Germans are like hawks, Landa explains, most cannot think like Jews, who are more like rats â€” a characterization that, of course, was a privileged metaphor and ideological instrument in the Naziâ€™s campaign against European Jewry.",,,,,

Mr. Tarantino makes it easy to do just that by capping this exegesis with an abrupt sight gag: after asking the farmer if he can smoke, Landa pulls out a pipe so comically large it immediately undercuts his threat, transforming him from a ferocious Jew hunter into a silly man whose flamboyant pipe suggests he suffers from some masculinity issues.",,,,,

Itâ€™s a shocking moment partly because this image resonates with horror, but itâ€™s also shocking because it comes cushioned with laughs. Yet the shock dissipates because the Jews are irrelevant here. What matters is how he builds the tension with unnerving quiet and a camera that circles Landa and the farmer like an ever-tightening rope. What matters, to Mr. Tarantino, is the filmmaking.",,,,,

He has also turned into a bad editor of his own material (his nominal editor, as usual, is Sally Menke) and seems unwilling or incapable of telling his A material from his B. The conversations in â€œInglourious Basterdsâ€ù are often repetitive and overlong and they rarely sing, in part because the period setting doesnâ€™t allow him to raid his vast pop-cultural storehouse.

This musical story of adolescent rebellion and artistic self-discovery, written by Stew (with music by him and Heidi Rodewald) from the raw material of Stewâ€™s own life, simmered with energy and ideas, with sonic and verbal wit, but it also strained for a soaring, transcendent theatricality that it could not quite achieve.

In â€œStill Walking,â€ù the story builds through an accretion of details, in shared glances, gestures and conversation. As with the disordered arc of many family gatherings, food is cooked and consumed amid a great deal of small talk, and children laugh loudly and run free through the rooms. The drama, such as it is, enters obliquely, coming to a slow boil in the bitter comments and sharp looks of the surviving son, Ryota (Hiroshi Abe), and in the oppressive silences of his father, a retired doctor, Kyohei (Yoshio Harada).

Like his brother, whose absence fills the house and whose photograph takes unsettling pride of place on an altar, Ryota has become something of a ghost. Thatâ€™s true for many  adult children, who can see their younger selves in every familiar and inviting ancestral nook. Here, though the dead son so fully inhabits the consciousness of his parents â€” and by extension the house, which in its gentle dilapidation has become a physical manifestation of them â€” there is little room for anyone else, even other ghosts.",,,,,

Her mother, Toshiko (Kirin Kiki), by far the most surprising character, clearly doesnâ€™t relish this projected home invasion. But she expresses her feelings about the proposed move to Ryota  only after Chinamiâ€™s family has left.  Because Mr. Kore-eda writes realistic characters rather than the self-actualized types you often find in the movies, they  rarely express themselves with blunt force and never with perfectly scripted paragraphs detailing every slight.

He seems to catch beauty on the fly, as when the three grandchildren, having gone for a walk, reach for some overhanging flowers, their fluttering fingers straining upward.

Yet Ryotaâ€™s unhappiness  is as crucial to the familyâ€™s dynamic as his fatherâ€™s glowering and his  motherâ€™s efficient, defensive bustling. This is life as itâ€™s lived, not dreamed.

The next day, some men rescue him from this inglorious throne and bring him to Trujillo (Nieves Cabrera) in a modest, disheveled house.

You watch Farrel in his natural habitat (the cargo ship, a warren of mystery and heavy metal). You watch him eat, sleep and drink, and eat, sleep and drink some more. You observe him in different environments and engaging with others of his species, including his bedridden mother and a young woman, Analia (Giselle Irrazabal).

Heâ€™s come to London to find his father, which he appears to do amid a confusion of strobing lights, throbbing music, pressing bodies and a lot of alcohol. After one such evening, he ends up sandwiched between Hannah (Katia Winter) and Mike (Iddo Goldberg), who may or may not be lovers, depending on the amount of booze and drugs consumed and whether the mood strikes them, which it often does.

Having met in a somewhat inebriated haze,  the two end up in a hotel room, staggering and falling down with laughter and drink. As he does with some scenes of Axl in bed with his lovers, Mr. Dos Santos shoots Veraâ€™s initial encounters  with this man as a series of disconnected images, often with the background gently blurred.

As he tags after these bodies at rest and in motion, Mr. Dos Santos creates not just a vision  of community but also a larger sense of being in the world. The squatters find room for one another, opening themselves and their beds to new possibilities. They make music and paint, creating a multi-everything utopia that might seem far-fetched or even self-indulgent but has the allure of an ideal. Outside, the adult world with its tidy beds beckons, while Axl and Vera, finally united in talk and wearing animal masks, make room to play.",,,,,

These goals are, conveniently, as impossible to measure as they are to criticize. They also rest on an unexamined investment in the culture of celebrity and publicity, which, while perhaps less globally destructive than carbon-burning consumerism, can have a corrosive effect on individual dignity and collective morality.

A lot of performers like to replay their early hits, so it isnâ€™t surprising that Mr. Moore, a practiced showman, recycles images of his younger, slimmer self engaging in one of his trademark moves: trying to enter a building to speak truth to power, only to be turned away by security guards. It was faintly amusing theater then, especially if you didnâ€™t think too hard about the fact that he was hassling working people just trying to do their jobs. Itâ€™s less amusing when he repeats the same routine in â€œCapitalism.â€ù",,,,,

Mr. Gervais stars as Mark Bellison, a sad sack and screenwriter who lives in a world that looks a lot like our own, only sleepier, less shiny and with no visible security cameras. The defining characteristic of this somewhat bland storybook land, with its calm streets and token homeless man, is that no one ever tells an untruth, not lovers or friends, bosses or assistants, moviemakers or advertisers. While that makes for some awkward moments, it also makes for some initially fine comedy. The tagline for Coke here is simple, elegant, true: â€œItâ€™s very famous.â€ù While an ad for Pepsi just concedes the obvious: â€œWhen they donâ€™t have Coke.â€ù",,,,,

When he goes on a first date with a beauty, Anna (Jennifer Garner), she opens the door and announces, â€œI was  just  masturbating.â€ù To which he replies, â€œThat makes me think of your vagina.â€ù This, in turn, makes her run upstairs and finish what she started. And so it embarrassingly, amusingly goes, as the mismatched couple, both honest to an excruciating and painful fault, dine at a restaurant where the hostess blurts out that sheâ€™s threatened by Anna, and a waiter begins service with the matter-of-fact announcement that Anna is out of Markâ€™s league.",,,,,

Over at Lecture Films, where Mark struggles as a writer, the movies are based only on true events, like the black plague. Narrated by stuffed shirts (Christopher Guest in whiskers) seated  in armchairs and pompously droning into the camera, this is cinema without fictional embellishment, heaving bosoms, rustling crinolines, passion, pleasure or intrigue, kind of like â€œMasterpiece Theaterâ€ù without Evelyn Waugh or the BrontÃ«s.",,,,,

(This is the first movie directing gig for both men.) Thatâ€™s too bad, because some of the sweetest moments are of Mark lying or rather exercising his imagination, as when he tenderly tells a dying woman that thereâ€™s more than the  void on the other side. Or when he summarizes the first fictional script, which features ninjas and aliens and sounds like something Roger Corman cooked up in the 1950s. In these scenes, lying becomes a means to transcendence, an escape from the quotidian, from our oppressive literal-mindedness, from our brute selves.",,,,,

What Jenny craves is not the fact of sex â€” though she does make sure to schedule the loss of her virginity  â€”  but full access to an ideal of sexiness, a world that is the opposite of the boring little England she knows and loathes.

The testimonials add to the overall deification that comes with any larger-than-life star production.

Happily, the moviemakers come down to earth (or as much as might be expected with Mr. Jackson onboard) for the subsequent rehearsals, which are regularly interspersed, or more rightly padded, with interview snippets featuring  musicians, singers, choreographers and costume designers.

The wittiest â€” a black-and-white Hollywood homage set to â€œSmooth Criminalâ€ù and probably inspired by the â€œGirl Huntâ€ù ballet in the 1953 Vincente Minnelli musical â€œThe Band Wagonâ€ù  â€” features Mr. Jackson wearing a white pinstripe suit and interacting with Rita Hayworth (she tosses him her black glove from â€œGildaâ€ù) and Humphrey Bogart (who, looking up from a kiss, throws him a scowl).

The softening effect most obviously benefits Mr. Jackson, whoâ€™s rarely seen in close-up and instead usually appears head to toe, energetically dancing, strutting, marching, moonwalking and sometimes understandably panting across the stage. This distanced vantage robs the curious of a chance to scrutinize that famous face, to unkindly survey the damage, but it also gives you the space to admire his liquid moves as he slips and slides and glides. Thatâ€™s especially important because Mr. Jackson, who after all is in the midst of complex rehearsals heâ€™s helping coordinate, doesnâ€™t often let loose vocally because heâ€™s conserving his voice (as he sometimes mentions) or can no longer roam around the higher registers.",,,,,

Truthfully, it is hard to imagine  a supernova like Mr. Jackson, in particular one who grew up so publicly and at times pathetically, sharing anything honest, much less raw, on camera, either because he wonâ€™t or he canâ€™t. In the end, all you can expect from such manufactured lives â€” and perhaps all that weâ€™re really due â€” are glimmers of the figure left amid the fractured and distorting funhouse mirrors.

He might look funny, with his glasses, lopsided clown hair and gasping mouth, but he doesnâ€™t behave as if he were a joke waiting for either a punch or a punch line, a disconnect between appearance and being that the Hesses smartly exploited.",,,,,

Born in 1955 to officially white parents, Ms. Laing â€” played by an uncharacteristically unsteady Sophie Okonedo â€” was judged white. But when the child entered the larger world, her darker skin, and especially her tightly curled black hair, marked her as different. At 10, she was dragged out of school by the police because the principal had decided she wasnâ€™t white. The government agreed and relabeled her â€œcolored.â€ù",,,,,

Her father, Abraham (Sam Neill, wound too tight), and mother, Sannie (an effective Alice Krige), run a grocery store for blacks. A passionate supporter of the government and its policies, Abraham insists that his black customers put their money on the counter, presumably to avoid physical contact. Sannie seems more tolerant, though sheâ€™s under the patriarchal heel. Theyâ€™re loving parents, demonstrably fond of their children, whose physical differences (Leon has a lighter complexion) they donâ€™t appear to acknowledge or even see until after they drop Sandra off at an all-white boarding school.",,,,,

Shunned by whites, she melts into the segregated shantytowns, having taken up with a vegetable seller, Petrus (Tony Kgoroge, delivering the best performance in the film), whose smile grows dim.

One choreographer prattles on about â€œcontextâ€ù to a dancer who nods her head gamely but studies his body language more than his words.

Itâ€™s not only the ingenuity of 3-D that sends some of that shadow drifting into the theaters.

(Donâ€™t worry about it, he says,  and she doesnâ€™t, though I did.) Mr. Kelly doesnâ€™t seem too concerned about the moral angle, either, which he takes his time getting to, creating a needless complication in a movie overstuffed  with complications, including severed toes, watery portals to another dimension, the Mars Viking mission,  murdered wives, tall ships and even, alas, the twin towers.",,,,,

Heâ€™s also better served by the digital cinematography than Ms. Diaz;  shot by Steven Poster, the movie has been washed in 1970s browns that serve the vibe if not her skin tone.

There are, as with his previous films, various visual gifts, like the spooky image of an airplane hangar glowing in the night and the odd image of Normaâ€™s little toe waving like a finger.

Mr. Reitman certainly hints at the trouble to come: however bright Mr. Clooneyâ€™s smile, there is something terribly off about Binghamâ€™s blithe attitude both toward his own existential reality and his profession.

The agonies of virginity have inspired myriad novels and films, if not always with as much humor as in Mr. Payneâ€™s telling. Another novelist, Glen David Gold, has called â€œYouth in Revolt: The Journals of Nick Twispâ€ù the â€œfunniest book ever written,â€ù suggesting a connection to  Richardsonâ€™s â€œClarissa.â€ù Mr. Payne might also have skimmed Lord Byronâ€™s long poem about Don Juan: that famed lothario is mentioned twice in the novel, and some of his adventures, at times in drag, are also echoed.",,,,,

Itâ€™s a bit of a squirm when a near-child natters on about all things penile. But when the horndog in question is two years shy of the age of majority,  he is in the safer  zone of mid-adolescence, where characters from the likes of â€œSuperbadâ€ù (in which Mr. Cera played another anguished virgin) roam about making goo-goo eyes at the opposite sex, and the occasional pie, with tumescent desperation.",,,,,

Mr. Arteta is equally good with the supporting cast, which is packed with recognizable faces that might be distracting elsewhere but instead add different colors, including Ms. Smart (warm, sad, foolish) and Ray Liotta (sleazy, funny, scary) as a cop who comforts Estelle one day and stays the night.",,,,,

The exterior backdrops tend to be overtly artificial, the skies so streaked with orange that you half expect to see Scarlett Oâ€™Hara shaking her fist at the heavens.

The initial ghostwriter behind the unfinished memoirs of a former British prime minister, Adam Lang (a superb Pierce Brosnan), has washed up dead on an American beach.

Based on the novel â€œThe Ghostâ€ù by Robert Harris, who shares screenwriting credit with Mr. Polanski, the film opens   under a menacing cloak of darkness that rarely rises. An abandoned car in the first shot leads to the first ghostwriterâ€™s beached body being lashed by ocean waters  in Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, a macabre setup that in turn leads to the Ghost receiving a thrashing in London, as heâ€™s insulted (by an editor who thinks heâ€™s wrong for the job); bullied (by the publisher who wants a fast turnaround); and punched (by a mugger who snatches a manuscript, mistaking it for Langâ€™s). By the time the Ghost meets Lang, whoâ€™s holed up at Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, he is as jumpy as the rest of us. (The film was largely shot in Germany.)",,,,,

Among the most initially confusing is Lang, a professional charmer whose beaming smiles, with their sinister undercurrent, and fits of rage convey depths that the Ghost soon begins to plumb, an endeavor that takes the shape of an investigation. This amateur sleuthing leads to unsurprising trouble, including with Langâ€™s wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams), a brainy beauty whose relationship with her husband holds  its own secrets and is transparently meant to invoke that between Cherie Booth and Tony Blair.",,,,,

Fingers are pointed, though sometimes it seems not only at Lang but also at Mr. Polanski, who is under house arrest in Switzerland awaiting word on whether he will be sent back  to Los Angeles to face sentencing for having had sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. Certainly the shots of Langâ€™s detractors, with their furiously distorted faces and accusatory placards (â€œguilty,â€ù â€œwantedâ€ù), gives the film an extra-cinematic tang, though as with so much here, itâ€™s also evident that Mr. Polanski is having his fun.",,,,,

Everything â€” including Alexandre Desplatâ€™s score, with its mocking, light notes  and urgent rhythms suggestive of Bernard Herrmann â€” works to sustain a mood, establish an atmosphere and confirm an authorial intelligence that distinguishes this film from the chaff. Unlike many modern Hollywood and Hollywood-style thrillers, which seek to wrest tension from a frenzy of cutting and a confusion of camera angles, Mr. Polanski creates suspense inside the frame through  dynamic angles and through the discrete, choreographed movements of the camera and actors. He makes especially effective use of the enormous windows in Langâ€™s house through which the sky and ocean beckon and threaten.",,,,,

Reading a work of art through the lens of biography is seductive, particularly when an artist ventures into the explicitly personal, as he did in â€œThe Pianist,â€ù his 2002 film about a musician who, like him, survived the Holocaust. But such interpretations can flatten poetry into prose and also serve as strategies to neuter artists, whose works of imagination are â€œrevealedâ€ù as nothing more than banal facts. This isnâ€™t to deny the personal in art, only an insistence on the elusiveness of creation. Mr. Polanskiâ€™s ventures into the horrific in films like â€œRepulsionâ€ù might have something to do with his history, but they are also a matter of affinities, inspirations, attitudes, competencies, tastes, pleasures.",,,,,

Tracing the lines between fact and fiction makes for a dandy parlor game, one that Mr. Polanski obviously wants us to play, at least for a while, because such resonances have their rewards. They thicken the texture of the work, even if they donâ€™t define it. Such thickening might seem especially critical with material as thin as â€œThe Ghost Writer,â€ù but these are the tools of a director working with every element at his disposal, including a colorful miscellany of emoting, popping, memorable faces (notably those of Kim Cattrall,  Tom Wilkinson, Eli Wallach and David Rintoul).",,,,,

But the pleasures of a well-directed movie should never be underestimated. The image of Mr. Brosnan abruptly leaning toward the camera like a man possessed is worth a dozen Oscar-nominated performances. And the way, when Lang chats with the Ghost â€”  his   arms and legs open, a drink in hand, as if he were hitting on a woman â€”  shows how an actor and his director can sum up an entire personality with a single pose. Mr. Polanskiâ€™s work with his performers is consistently subtle even when the performances seem anything but, which is true of this very fine film from welcome start to finish.",,,,,

Yet these luxury items are resonant, as is their exclusive setting and the way Malikâ€™s admiring gaze momentarily stops the flow of the action: each adds another element to this portrait of an impoverished young Frenchman of Arab descent who is transformed in prison.

Like some other prison tales â€œA Prophet,â€ù which won the grand prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, has the flavor of the ethnographic. Its subject is an individual in a context, and while Malik (Tahar Rahim, a stealth presence) is the storyâ€™s focus, heâ€™s also part of an inquiry on power.

The film opens with Malik being ordered to strip for the guards on his arrival, a ritualistic divesting (and humiliation) that the inmates and the prison system continue. He soon attracts the unwelcome attention of CÃ©sar Luciani (the tremendous Niels Arestrup), an old lion who rules over the Corsican gang that controls the prison, including some guards. To protect his own, CÃ©sar orders Malik to murder another prisoner, Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi), also of Arab extraction. Without friends or affiliation, Malik believes he has no choice and carries out the murder with a razor blade that heâ€™s hidden inside his mouth and which he fumbles as the blood gushes over him, his victim, the walls.",,,,,

At any rate it is a ghastly vision. But it isnâ€™t simply the gore or Reyebâ€™s twitching body that make the scene difficult to watch: itâ€™s the way the murder has been messily, even frantically staged and filmed, the two men thrashing inside a frame that can barely contain them. There is nothing exciting about the violence, and there are no beauty shots of the pooling blood. Mr. Audiard effectively turns us into witnesses to a horrible crime, though not in order to punish us for our ostensible complicity in the violence.

Mr. Audiard doesnâ€™t sex up Malikâ€™s crimes, turning them into easily digestible spectacles, the kind made to accompany a large popcorn and soda. But he doesnâ€™t solicit our pity: Malik is guilty. Yet guilt is like a poisonous gas in this film, it suffuses the prison, permeating the guardsâ€™ rooms and the cells in which corrupt lawyers counsel their murderous clients, and the larger world where politicians make decisions that send some to jail while freeing others.",,,,,

CÃ©sar keeps Malik busy running errands, which allows Mr. Audiard to take him (and us) all across the prison and sometimes outside of it. This expands the story and Malikâ€™s horizon, as do some other prisoners, Ryad (Adel Bencherif) and Jordi (Reda Kateb).

You could  read it as an allegory about France and its uneasy relations with generations of Arab immigrants and their children. As usual, there is room for diverging, even contradictory interpretations, and the political certainly is as much at play here as the Oedipal. Mr. Audiard, for his part, working from a screenplay he wrote with several others, avoids speeches that explain everything and instead opts for a materialist approach that attends to the realities of prison life, showing how guards and porters deliver the prisonersâ€™ food (baguettes!) and how Malik, as he shakes off CÃ©sarâ€™s grip, helps distribute illicit drugs.",,,,,

Heâ€™s playing another patriarch in this film, of course, the kind who rules small worlds with cruelty. With his overcoats, bulky frame and proud carriage, he can bring to mind the later-life Jean Gabin, though Mr. Arestrupâ€™s terrifying smile quickly snuffs out such nostalgic thoughts. CÃ©sar is not a figure of sentimentality. Among other things he is a businessman, and the cold-bloodedness with which he wields his power might be a matter of personal depravity.

But  Malik was not meant for our love, and Mr. Rahimâ€™s performance, while  strong, is purposefully  not flashy, as movie outlaws often are. Mr. Audiard seems to be after something else, and in â€œA Prophetâ€ù he shows us the truth of another human being who might otherwise escape from our sight because he is too foreign, or whom we might try to pity just to feel safe.

Weighing in at 90 pounds of rage on the page and a hair heavier and less fierce on the screen, where sheâ€™s played by Noomi Rapace, Salander embodies a host of au courant fantasies. Sheâ€™s a geek girl for starters, a computer hacker who would have downloaded this flick before it even hit theaters, and whose fetish wear and shiny boots suggest that sheâ€™s into BDSM, as they say in bondage, discipline and sadomasochism circles.",,,,,

She doesnâ€™t take anything lying down, including sex and violence. Sheâ€™s the top dog in bed as well as in the streets, where she follows the creed that itâ€™s better to die on your feet than on your knees. From one angle, she looks like a consummate cool chick of the sort routinely conjured up by the science-fiction visionary William Gibson, whose dream girl in his novel â€œPattern Recognition,â€ù with her singular talents, black clothes and sleek, tousled â€œanime hair, rendered hi-rez,â€ù could easily describe Salander.",,,,,

Sheâ€™s a less disquieting presence in the movie (a protracted 152 minutes), which was competently, sometimes ploddingly directed by Niels Arden Oplev and written by Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaj Arcel. Though Ms. Rapace is a fine professional scowler, with cheekbones that thrust like knives and a pout thatâ€™s mostly pucker, she tends to register as an intriguing idea instead of a thoroughly realized character.

As in the book, Salander shares narrative pride of place in the movie with a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist, adequate and sympathetic), who, after losing a highly publicized libel case to a corporate titan, is hired by a semi-retired captain of industry, Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), an  octogenarian who wants to know how and why his favorite niece, Harriet, disappeared decades earlier.

But the flashbacks are so visually and thematically blunt that they upstage the narrativeâ€™s interesting parallels and disturb its political undertow: Salander and Blomkvist initially occupy separate story lines that seem to converge only because sheâ€™s hired to spy on him. Along the way, each runs a gantlet of patriarchal violence (personal, social, capitalist), a trail of horrors that ends in a pile of bodies.

At times they seem like children, particularly in their games â€” Chris makes a little animal, a fetish really, from ginger root and matches that they call Schnappi â€” but like most childrenâ€™s play these exchanges feel like a rehearsal for adulthood.",,,,,

No one throws any dishes during the meal, the first of two significant joint dinners, but thereâ€™s plenty of wreckage by the time Sana serves the last drinks. As the scene plays out across an outdoor table and through the subtle choreography of the charactersâ€™ movements, you watch as four people make and break allegiances. When Chris confides to Hans about his work â€” information heâ€™d kept from Gitti â€” you see how a relationship can change with a few seemingly irrelevant words. You see the betrayal in Gittiâ€™s stricken face; you might well feel it in your own body.",,,,,

He jokes that she likes him as a girl and then, more seriously, asks if she sees him as masculine. She tells him the question is silly and then, somewhat laughingly, says, â€œDo something masculine and see if I notice.â€ù In some respects, much of what happens in â€œEveryone Elseâ€ù touches on many of the issues and anxieties that color all relationships, heterosexual and otherwise, when desire and power meet head on.

A few scenes almost drag and a late flash of a knife feels false. But the filmâ€™s uninflected realism and unforced beauty alone make it worthy of exploring and revisiting, as does the simple truth that love is too often an elusive subject in contemporary cinema. Ms. Ade doesnâ€™t pretend to have an answer to our most profound questions about love in her plaintive scenes from a romance.

Maybe Ms. Zemeckis wanted to protect the women; you can understand her desire to make sure they were not pathologized.

The story gets going with Laevsky bitterly complaining about Nadya to an older friend, a doctor, Samoylenko (Niall Buggy). Laevsky claims to no longer care for Nadya, who, having left her husband, now inspires her loverâ€™s contempt or, perhaps, fatigue. Like a caged animal, he wants out and claws at Samoylenko as Von Koren watches and seethes, stoking his loathing for Laevsky.  For his part, by cutting to Nadya during Laevskyâ€™s rant and capping the scene with a disapproving look from Von Koren, Mr. Kosashvili suggests that his own sympathies are divided.",,,,,

Thereâ€™s a window open near him, shedding light into the room, and you can almost feel the thick heat of the day, a sense of torpor, when Laevsky suddenly smacks a nearby table as if decimating a fly.

Laevsky begs Samoylenko to lend him money so he can flee, rubles that the doctor in turn borrows from Von Koren. The zoologist agrees, but only on the condition that Laevsky will send for Nadya. This impossible exchange â€” a promise of freedom and its simultaneous refusal â€” binds the three principals in this mini-drama like a rope, which only tightens as the story unfolds. As theyâ€™re drawn closer together, they deepen into unhappier versions of themselves: Von Koren becomes inflexible, Laevsky turns hysterical, and Nadya grows increasingly desperate.

(Laevsky sweats like the condemned, while Von Koren remains arid in body and deed.) Mr. Kosashvili doesnâ€™t push his contrasts too hard or overplay the interludes of drama.
