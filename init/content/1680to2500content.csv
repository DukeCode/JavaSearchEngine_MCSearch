What is often missing from the formula is any real insight into the reason we might be interested in the first place, which is the music.

What‰Ûªs missing is a directorial point of view, including about vigilante groups, the so-called war on drugs, and Mexican and American policies and politics. When Mr. Foley mentions, for instance, that the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled his organization an extremist group, the comment simply hangs there.

Sometimes the meanings of these fragments unfold clearly; sometimes you need to piece the fragments together, as you would a jigsaw puzzle.

The director, Mr. Brocka (1939-91), makes the house, a patchwork of metal, wood and cardboard, an early focal point, turning it into a microcosm of the sprawl and misery that surround it. Here, Insiang lives with her harsh, bullying mother, Tonya (an excellent Mona Lisa), and a gaggle of relatives that includes a fistful of young children. As Mr. Brocka plays with his framing, going from tight to wide, putting the scene‰Ûªs combustibility into stark visual terms, he transforms this one family into a pungent city.",,,,,,,,,

It‰Ûªs a raucous, seemingly chaotic scene that takes on an abrupt narrative clarity when Tonya insists that two of the children return the clothes that she bought for them, a demand that leaves them literally naked. And, just like that, two more children have joined the ranks of those who are seen wandering and playing amid the garbage. Mr. Brocka likes to go big and blunt, but in ‰ÛÏInsiang,‰Ûù he does his strongest work when he delivers his politics quietly, as when Insiang, in another scene, hangs wet laundry on barbed wire strung outside her house.",,,,,,,,,

Once the relatives clear out, in moves Tonya‰Ûªs younger lover, Dado (Ruel Vernal), a Simon Legree-type brute who has his own name tattooed on his chest, which he frequently bares. The complications mount, as do the male offenses.

With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows.
