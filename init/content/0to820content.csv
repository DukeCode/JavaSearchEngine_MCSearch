Like the first movie, this one is jammed with action-driven sequences, some wildly bloated and most of them cartoonish. For one fight, though, he cranks the music and lets the screen bleed as the ostensible good guys kill one villain after another, the casualties falling to the sound of a head-bobbing song. Tonally, the episode feels unpleasantly sour and wrong for this young series, which is best when it goes light; it‰Ûªs a bummer watching another director attempt the kind of smiling sadism that not even Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino can always pull off."

Emily is self-absorbed, lazy and rude, but also so lacking in true meanness or guile and so dogged in her pursuit of shallow pleasures that she‰Ûªs kind of fun to be around. Even though she drinks too much, says obnoxious things and misbehaves in other ways ‰ÛÓ killing two people, for example, one with a shovel and the other with a harpoon ‰ÛÓ it‰Ûªs impossible to get mad at her, or even seriously annoyed."

This lineage and its burdens take a while to work through, primarily because this movie plays like the first installment in a hoped-for series.

The bad news is that it is a hash, choosing to jumble the historical record and frame a Churchill bout with depression against the D-Day invasion of France by Allied forces. While Churchill did express serious reservations about the operation in the weeks before it occurred, he was largely reconciled to the plan by the time it happened. This movie has Churchill, played with both grim determination and wild abandon by Brian Cox, railing against the high command in terms and gestures that mostly suggest a poorly run group therapy session."

When her servant, Maria (Holliday Grainger, who also narrates) becomes pregnant by the fishmonger (Jack O‰ÛªConnell), Sophia proposes a scheme in which Cornelis can keep the baby. In the meantime, Sophia must merely pretend to be pregnant while Maria pretends not to be. This unconvincing charade culminates in one of the silliest birth scenes in recent memory."

She‰Ûªs making waves as a player and as a champion of women‰Ûªs rights, including equal pay, and earning plaudits from the likes of President Nixon. Bobby seems to be living off his indulgent wealthy wife (Elisabeth Shue), a frozen smiler right out of Stepford, and spending time on idle in a fancy office. Mostly, Billie Jean is winning while Bobby is keeping boredom at bay."

The pair‰Ûªs introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags, and Sam ends up carrying the load.

For a guy who looks chiseled by Michelangelo, Mr. Hemsworth can be a surprisingly agile physical performer, capable of real bounce, and he clearly likes ricocheting off walls as much as he does ceding center stage to the other actors. These include Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, who, after an unpromising entrance, develops into a real character with emotion and an all-too-brief flashback filled with fury, beauty, liquid motion and mythological mystery."

In that way, it is about the creation of a new man who, the story suggests, is liberated by pleasure that doesn‰Ûªt necessarily establish sexual identity. It‰Ûªs important that Elio and Oliver have relationships with women, though for seemingly different reasons: the overheated Elio sleeps with a girlfriend (Esther Garrel), while Oliver carries on a more performative affair with a local (Victoire Du Bois). The women are not treated with much kindness, but these affairs further complicate the movie‰Ûªs vision of pleasure‰Ûªs fluidity."

The charismatic Mr. Chalamet, Mr. Hammer and Mr. Stuhlbarg ‰ÛÓ whose brilliant delivery of a tricky speech pierces the heart and, crucially, the movie‰Ûªs lustrous patina ‰ÛÓ transform beauty into feeling.

The grand piano isn‰Ûªt for show and neither are the books or the open affection and respect with which Elio and his parents treat one another. (The movie reminds you how rarely characters read for pleasure, much less listen to classical music.) ‰ÛÏCall Me by Your Name‰Ûù is set in 1983, so no one is staring into a smartphone.

So Mr. Guadagnino speaks for them by eroticizing their world, making desire visible in the luxuriousness of the setting, in the green enveloping the villa, the gushing waters of a pool and the graceful lines of male statues. When Oliver hungrily eats a soft-boiled egg, cracking the shell and causing the yolk to messily spurt, Mr. Guadagnino‰Ûªs lyricism slides into comedy; it‰Ûªs hard to know just how self-mocking the moment is meant to be."

Mr. Guadagnino avoids directly engaging the difference in Elio and Oliver‰Ûªs ages, which might have forced him to explore the underside of his sumptuous surfaces to greater, messier effect. Instead, Mr. Guadagnino leans on beauty, as when Elio‰Ûªs father poetically speaks to an increasingly agitated Oliver about the ‰ÛÏageless ambiguity‰Ûù of some male statues (‰ÛÏas if they‰Ûªre daring you to desire them‰Ûù)."

A gifted musician, Elio easily moves from piano to guitar (much as his family shifts from speaking Italian to French to English), talent that makes him seem at one with the villa‰Ûªs miles of bookshelves, its velvet sofas, scattered Oriental rugs and tastefully arranged antiques."
