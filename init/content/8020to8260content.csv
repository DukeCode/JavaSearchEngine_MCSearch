Shot in Super 16 millimeter, the film looks grubby enough that it might as well have been shot in low-grade video, the visible grain notwithstanding. That's particularly unfortunate, since the camerawork is so good. The camera tends to move only if Mr. Demme wants us to notice something, like the worn-away varnish on Mr. Young's guitar; both the camera movements and the editing take it nice and easy, like the songs. A shot of the full moon over the Ryman before the concert is especially lovely, not only because it alludes to one of Mr. Young's favorite images ("blue moon sinking,"  "full moon risin',"  "yellow moon,"  "silver moon,"  "unfulfilled moon") but also because, I swear, it looks like a beacon.""iven all the free-flowing love, it may seem churlish to complain about the poor image quality.

Like the album, which features some of Mr. Young's memorable colleagues — the steel guitarist Ben Keith, the bass guitarist Rick Rosas and Emmylou Harris, among others — the film has the feel of a family reunion, though one conspicuously short on the young'uns. There are a lot of gray and white hairs amassed on that stage, plenty of wrinkles and jowls too. Working with the cinematographer Ellen Kuras and nine cameras, including one mounted on a Steadicam, Mr. Demme doesn't shy away from the lines and the jowls; he gives them their due.

Speaking in Italian-accented English (a detail explained with a throwaway about a boarding school), Sarah soon proves herself a supremely unfit mother. Then again, this chick has trouble standing up.

(Later, it was her disappearing act that fueled her notoriety.) In the early 1950's, she began working with the brother-and-sister team Irving and Paula Klaw (played by Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor), posing for untold numbers of photographs and 8- and 16-millimeter film loops with such self-evident titles as "Betty's Exotic Dance in High Heels."

It's a truism of art history that while men act, women appear, smiling demurely away from the gaze of the viewer. In many of her photographs, by contrast, Bettie looks straight into the camera with a grin that is by turns twinkling and devouring, and flips that old truism on its head by turning her appearance into a performance. She knows what you want; she wants it, too."1520031733-15446,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/14/movies/14bett.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/14/movies/14bett.html,"That's to the good of the film because while the pinup was mildly notorious, the fully dressed woman wasn't all that interesting.

The domestication of Ethan Hunt may have seemed like a good idea, a humanizing touch, perhaps, but it only bogs down the action. Worse, it turns a perfectly good franchise into a seriously strange vanity project, as the simpering brunette is swept into a new world by a dashing operative for a clandestine organization. Much like the man playing him, Ethan works only if you don't know anything about what makes him tick. Once upon a Hollywood time, the studios carefully protected their stars from the press and the public.

The changes  the comically tormented siblings go through are viewed from an off-center, Fassbinder-like perspective that weaves along a circuitous path from dark comedy to melodrama to mush. At different moments, the film wants to elicit laughter, disgust and tears of empathy. But aside from appreciating the movie's sturdy performances, my reaction to this satire of the middle-class, all-German family swung from revulsion to mystification."1520031869-16102,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/09/movies/09agne.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/09/movies/09agne.html,"The movie's siblings are Agnes (Martin Weiss), a lonely male-to-female transsexual and nightclub performer, and her brothers Hans-Jörg (Moritz Bleibtreu), a single, sex-starved librarian, and Werner (Herbert Knaup), a rising politician who is married with children. The source of all trouble is their dreaded father (Vadim Glowna), an affluent hermit with a long, shaggy mane who suggests a near-catatonic acid casualty from the 1960's.

He also rewinds to high school and to several earlier cringe-worthy incidents involving his parents (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner, each wearing some grotesque facial prosthetics). In a sop to the film's target audience, he also uses the remote to reduce the speed of a female jogger so he can watch the health-conscious blonde's generously proportioned breasts bounce slowly, slowly, up and down, an effect that would have been impossible if this ambulatory eye candy had been wearing the proper brassiere."1520031922-16357,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/movies/23clic.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/movies/23clic.html,"WITH: Adam Sandler (Michael Newman), Kate Beckinsale (Donna Newman), Christopher Walken (Morty), Henry Winkler (Ted), David Hasselhoff (Ammer), Julie Kavner (Trudy), Jennifer Coolidge (Janine) and Sean Astin (Bill)."1520031922-16353,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/movies/23clic.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/movies/23clic.html,""Click" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

The women in turn do their best to ignore each other while seeking companionship elsewhere: the wife, a restless, succulent beauty who wouldn't be out of place in a Tennessee Williams play, retreats into another man's arms, while her sister-in-law keeps tabs on a young neighborhood girl, Batti (Pumidika Sapurni Peiris), for whom life is an obstacle course marked by poison and grasping old men.

Like Mr. Antonioni, who once dyed grass in one of his films to underscore "the sense of desolation, of death," Mr. Jayasundara uses color both to create an enveloping mood and to underscore the medium's plasticity.

Most of what the audience sees on screen, however, is a re-enactment, conducted mainly by nonprofessional actors. By the time the action reaches Guantánamo — those scenes were shot in Iran — the artifice is unmistakable, since no camera could have penetrated the actual isolation cells, interrogation rooms and chicken-wire cages of Camps X-Ray and Delta.

By the 1950's, the zoom years of Jack Kerouac and James Dean, Los Angeles pedestrians who braved the city's streets could be seen covering their mouths with handkerchiefs, trying to filter the air. Many decades and smog alerts later, the state took bold action.

Their attempts to fight the influence of the Mafia — and to curb violence that in the early 1980’s was claiming three lives a week in Palermo — were often obstructed by longstanding traditions of red tape and outright corruption.

The aftermath of Mr. Falcone’s and Mr. Borsellino’s deaths was a wave of popular revulsion against the Mafia, and a belated cleansing of the political system. But then the rise of Silvio Berlusconi, who became prime minister in 2001, led to the systematic disempowering of the judiciary system and the repeal of legal instruments (like the Italian witness protection program) that Mr. Falcone and Mr. Borsellino had fought for.

There are a few moments of amusing, self-conscious auto-homage: a Wilson basketball with a human face smudged onto it; plumbing fixtures that come to life with the slinky movements of “Jurassic Park” dinosaurs; a suburban Halloween out of “E.T.” But the deeper imprint of Mr. Spielberg’s influence, in particular, lies in the film’s evocation of childhood as a state of wonder tinged with darkness. The absence of supervising grown-ups is both scary and exciting, and the monstrous house will remind audience members of all ages of the pleasure of being frightened without pushing the fear past comfortable limits."1520032032-16908,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/movies/21mons.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/movies/21mons.html,"It also represents, to the technology nerds in the audience, an interesting refinement of animation techniques. Like Robert Zemeckis’s “Polar Express,” “Monster House” (for which Mr. Zemeckis served as an executive producer) uses the digitally captured movements of real actors rather than computer-generated algorithms as the basis for its animated images. The people in the movie look a little like molded-plastic figurines (the ones in “Polar Express” looked more like porcelain dolls), but their gestures are uncannily fluid and unpredictable, making you appreciate the quality of the acting more than you generally do in animated films. The postures and gestures of DJ (Mitchell Musso) and his pals — a pudgy fellow named Chowder (Sam Lerner) and a preppy redhead named Jenny (Spencer Locke) — have an authentically loose and antic look. They seem like real kids, rather than like super-cute, big-headed cartoon moppets."1520032032-16909,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/movies/21mons.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/movies/21mons.html,"And for the most part they talk and behave like real kids, too, or at least like characters drawn from the rich tradition of plucky, intellectually curious kiddie-lit heroes. DJ is descended from Encyclopedia Brown (perhaps by way of Jimmy Neutron, but never mind), and Jenny bears some temperamental resemblance to Harriet the Spy. I’m sure Chowder will remind you of someone in your fifth-grade class, wherever or whenever that was. The adults in the picture — DJ’s dithering parents (Fred Willard and Catherine O’Hara), who take off for a dental convention the day before Halloween, Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the grumpy sitter who takes their place, and the bumbling town policemen (Kevin James and Nick Cannon) — are predictably useless.

The murky results are generally unlovely if occasionally striking, though, like Mr. Shyamalan’s decision to have most of the actors deliver most of their lines in a hush, as if they were courtiers tendering precious gifts, the low illumination does help create an air of claustrophobic intimacy."1520032030-16896,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/movies/21wate.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/movies/21wate.html,"Unfortunately, while Ms. Howard’s character, the regrettably  named Story, spends a lot of the film wet, she’s one of those juiceless virginal fantasies who inspire pure thoughts, noble deeds and stifled yawns.

The ingenious palette adds to the spooky beauty of the otherworldly setting, which, with its vaultlike chambers, wavy crawlways and spiky stalactites, takes on unmistakable sexual overtones, particularly as the women’s breathing becomes more labored, and their shirts grow clingy with sweat.

Despite a little rough business with an effigy on a cross, this awkward tableau doesn’t seem all that blasphemous, particularly in view of artists like Andres Serrano, who have helped drain words like subversive of meaning. Luis Buñuel pulled off a better trick 40 years ago, and with more economy, by posing Catherine Deneuve as St. Sebastian and flinging mud at her in “Belle de Jour.” Though the reason Buñuel succeeded so brilliantly and enduringly is that he blasphemed a bigger modern god, that of celebrity."1520032088-17200,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/movies/09luna.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/movies/09luna.html,"Those seeking the usual charnel-house cheap thrills characteristic of so much modern horror will be disappointed; Mr. Svankmajer’s provocations skew toward the intellectual and the shivery rather than the pop and the visceral, and at his best, he doesn’t just get under your skin, but also deep in your head, too.

Mr. Dillon, wearing a beard and the flushed cheeks of a committed lush, sounds as persuasive as he looks.

Using a large private army whose numbers included Congolese orphans, the king and his agents squeezed the land of its resources, slaughtering elephants for ivory, tapping trees for rubber.

In other words, it’s “United 93” without the tears. The filmmakers don’t overplay the political angle, though they do squeeze in a Middle Eastern snake and a scene of an F.B.I. agent sneering about the A.C.L.U.

But what connects “Funny Ha Ha” and “Mutual Appreciation” to Cassavetes, or at least his legacy of willful independence, isn’t the handheld camera work or the persistent intimacy, which could have easily been learned from cinéma vérité.

That Rocco DeLuca and the Burden are attached, in these ways and more, to Kiefer Sutherland — son of Donald and star of “24” — may not be their only claim to distinction, but it is the only discernible reason for the existence of “I Trust You to Kill Me,” Manu Boyer’s inconsequential documentary about the band’s brief first tour of Europe."1520032209-17802,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/movies/08trus.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/movies/08trus.html,Opens today in Manhattan.1520032209-17799,http://sis-teach-01.sis.pitt.edu/spring2018/jid17/8020to8260url.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/movies/08trus.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/movies/08trus.html,"As it follows the band from one city to another, “I Trust You to Kill Me” becomes less about Mr. DeLuca and more about his sponsor.
