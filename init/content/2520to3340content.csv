The film asks us to believe that she is at once an astute storyteller and an emotional automaton entirely lacking in psychological insight. It also indulges in the common biographical fallacy of grounding adult creativity in childhood misery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its treatment of women is the strongest evidence for the second option. On his way up, Jordan trades in his first wife, a sweet hometown girl named Teresa (Cristin Milioti), for a blonder, bustier new model named Naomi (Margot Robbie), whose nakedness is offered to the audience as a special bonus. (Mr. DiCaprio never shows as much as she does.) The movieâ€™s misogyny is not the sole property of its characters, nor is the humiliation and objectification of women â€” an insistent, almost compulsive motif â€” something it merely depicts.

An older relative, Taitok (Bunsri Yindi), wants to kill the surviving child because, she insists, twins are bad luck.

Mr. Steadman wrote â€œVermeerâ€™s Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces,â€ù in which he argues, as others have before him, that Vermeer used a camera obscura to create his paintings. A camera obscura â€” a precursor to the photographic camera â€” is an optical device used to project images. As Mr. Steadman has asserted elsewhere, Vermeer used â€œthe camera to study optical images and effects; as an instrument with which to set up and adjust his compositional arrangements of sitters and furniture; and as a means to obtain traced outlines for complete pictures, at their final sizes.â€ù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He immersed himself in all things Vermeer and because he seems to have a lot of flex time, he traveled and studied and created a mirrored tool that was like something the painter could have used. By using this apparatus at a certain angle, Mr. Jenison found he could paint a reflected image in great detail, capturing the originalâ€™s shapes and colors. He then recreated the room and figures in Vermeerâ€™s â€œThe Music Lessonâ€ù to see if he could make his own version. â€œIâ€™m going to try to paint a Vermeer,â€ù he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certainly, Mr. Jenison doesnâ€™t put it that way, though he comes close. â€œItâ€™s possible,â€ù he says soon after the movie opens, that Vermeer â€œcould paint some pretty remarkable pictures without a lot of training. Itâ€™s possible that he was more of an experimenter, more of a tinkerer, more of a geek. And in that way I feel a kinship with him because Iâ€™m a computer graphics guy, and we use technology to make a realistic, beautiful image, and itâ€™s possible thatâ€™s exactly what Vermeer was doing.â€ù Here, Mr. Jenison tries to turn the possible into the probable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One belongs to the present day: a silver-haired eminence, walking slowly through the grounds of Theresienstadt and explaining, in a rumbling, scolding baritone, what happened there. The hamlet was cynically used by the Nazis as a decoy to show concerned visitors (notably the International Red Cross) that the Jews in German-occupied lands were being treated decently, and Mr. Lanzmann sets out to anatomize the particular cruelty of this deception. It was not only that Theresienstadt, 37 miles from Prague, was a transit point for Jews who would be deported to the death camps in the East, but also that its facade of normalcy was maintained through terror and manipulation. The Nazi authorities forced the Jews to become accomplices in their own destruction and in the denial of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jade is supposed to be 17 and sheltered, having spent most of her high school years giving comfort to her parents, Hugh and Anne (Bruce Greenwood and Joely Richardson), after the death of a son. Unlike Ms. Shields, whose status as a preternaturally sexualized child star imbued her with an otherworldly, almost celestial air (the celebrity who fell to Earth), the coltish Ms. Wilde mostly just suggests the supermodel next door. Ms. Feste responds accordingly and shoots Jade twirling and running as if she were in a commercial for an exciting new product. It isnâ€™t that people in love donâ€™t sometimes run ecstatically into the wind, but that the image, like so many shots and so many of the emotional moments, is so canned. When Jade and David do make love, itâ€™s on the floor in front of a fireplace; they also hold hands when they jump off a pier into some water. About the only original touch is how the script, by Ms. Feste and Joshua Safran, shifts the storyâ€™s weight to Hugh, whose love for his daughter smolders with all the weird, lunatic intensity thatâ€™s otherwise missing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The need for aid after the quake seemed obvious given the devastation, yet as Mr. Peck starkly illustrates, the gulf between what was needed and what was initially provided was at times vast.

With Mr. Maloof playing M.C. and sleuth, he and Mr. Siskel follow much the same arc that runs through the better news accounts about Maier.

More news articles followed, and by January 2011, the Chicago Cultural Center had mounted an exhibition titled â€œFinding Vivian Maier: Chicago Street Photographer.â€ù The industrious Mr. Maloof, meanwhile, scanned more of her work, bought more of her negatives and started telling his tale and hers, or as much as he knew.

Vivian Maier is a find but sheâ€™s also now a business, and the documentary would be stronger if it had dug into the complexities of what it means when one person assumes ownership of anotherâ€™s art.

She was introduced to the world, as it were, by John Maloof, one of this movieâ€™s directors, who bought a box of her negatives at a Chicago auction in 2007 for about $400.

Thereâ€™s another undercurrent here about her status as an artist (partly because she didnâ€™t formally study art) and even questions about photographyâ€™s status as an art (a hoary theme that emerges because she didnâ€™t print all of her own work).

This is also a movie made for the big screen: there are plenty of TV-ready medium and head-and-shoulder close-ups, but Mr. Eska uses tight ones sparingly and has a feel for landscape, often showing the characters framed against the trees, pale sky and pooling night, as if to emphasize the world in which they exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The image is visually arresting, including chromatically, as black shifts against white with a spooky, morbid loveliness that draws you in. It also conveys a sense of playfulness that underscores that Will, despite his protests, is still a child. Yet when the camera continues to trail after Will, it feels as if Mr. Eska were moving away from a concretely, resonantly human moment â€” and a boy fooling with a weird talisman of death â€” and into that Terrence Malick realm where light and the mystery of being converge at the back of a characterâ€™s head.

Will and Marcus find Nate digging graves for the Union and persuade him to return south to visit his brother, whom they say is dying.

Mr. Webb has some fun with the image of Spider-Man swinging through the urban canyons, and there are moments â€” as when the image freezes on the tucked, airborne Spider-Man, ready to spring into action like an Olympian â€” in which the movie taps into the giddy freedom and near-unboundedness that the characterâ€™s physical transformation has brought him.

Gwen is actually more interesting. Thatâ€™s because, unlike some other superhero stories in which godlike heroes live and love among ordinary folk, Peter remains a strongly human presence.

As in the first movie, the guiding comic principle here remains the appearance of ironic detachment followed by an assertion of sincerity thatâ€™s as appealing as it is disingenuous.

They meet men, including a hard-drinking, hard-loving farmer, Earl (Gary Cole), and his bland, smiling son, Bobby (Mark Duplass), and spend time in a lesbian utopia with Pearlâ€™s cousin, Lenore (Kathy Bates), who dispenses bootstrap ideology and lives with a near-silent partner, Susanne (Sandra Oh).

In short order, she loses her car, her job and her husband in ways that suggest that her dignity split long ago.

Mr. Linklater is especially fond of showing two people walking and talking, and you learn as much about the charactersâ€™ relationships from how they inhabit space â€” his two-shots speak volumes â€” as from what they say.

In contrast to the bedraggled human colony, the ape encampment is a thriving city-state with distinctive wooden architecture, domesticated horses, a sophisticated (mostly signed) language and an educational system overseen by Maurice, the gentle, copper-furred orangutan who gave the first movie an extra fillip of soul.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is plenty of evidence â€” both in the movie and beyond it â€” to support Kobaâ€™s view, but the film comes down squarely, and maybe a little too squishily, on the side of tolerance and cooperation. The ape and human societies are parallel primitive patriarchies (women nurture and worry, while men lead and fight, a disappointing but hardly surprising failure of imagination on the filmmakersâ€™ part), and they are threatened by symmetrical schisms. As Koba opposes Caesar, so does Malcolm (Mr. Clarkeâ€™s character) find himself increasingly at odds with Dreyfus (Mr. Oldman), who sees the apes as a mortal threat to be confronted with maximum brutality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You see a glimpse of that man in clips from a 1967 interview filmed in Tehran. The footage â€” battered, vibrant â€” shows him painting and, yes, smoking while talking about his art. (â€œOf course I am a historic figure.â€ù) Ms. Farahani repeatedly returns to this film, which puts the past into play with the present.

Mr. Mohassessâ€™s penchant for representing dangling penises in his work produced official consternation in Iran; itâ€™s less evident whether his exile was, at least in part, because heâ€™s gay, a topic that emerges in cackling asides and harangues. What is absolutely unambiguous is that the lines between his life and his work tend to blur. You see that when, over the duration of â€œFifi Howls,â€ù he points to one photograph after another of paintings and sculptures that he says have â€œdied.â€ù These deaths (or perhaps more rightly, murders) may have been acts of resistance, however perverse.

The 1979 revolution is one reason for his workâ€™s disappearance; Mr. Mohassessâ€™s habit of destroying his paintings and sculptures is another. The reasons for this destruction are complex and emerge primarily through Mr. Mohassessâ€™s recollections and Ms. Farahaniâ€™s contrapuntal voice-over. Their voices arenâ€™t exactly dueling: She wants to pay tribute to him, and he seems happy to be commended. Even so, as she asks questions, politely prodding and circling him â€” Iâ€™m uncertain if her oblique approach is a critical strategy or a matter of culture or gender or both â€” it becomes clear that he doesnâ€™t necessarily want to answer her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even so, you may soon intuit that thereâ€™s a strong link between the howling and the cackling that regularly erupts from the movieâ€™s subject, the Iranian artist Bahman Mohassess. Itâ€™s an unnerving sound because of its wincingly harsh, broken resonance, but also because of the eerie juxtaposition created by the image of Mr. Mohassessâ€™s cigarette smoke curling around his head, not far from a portable oxygen device. Itâ€™s hard not to think that he may be on a suicide mission, though this thoughtful, moving documentary does make you wonder if, after a lifetime of trouble, heâ€™s just laughing at fate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond that, there is not much about him online in English. This alone makes â€œFifi Howls From Happinessâ€ù important, although I wish Ms. Farahani had grabbed a better camera when she ran out to meet Mr. Mohassess. The digital-video images look badly smeared when projected, which is frustrating in a movie with a lot of photographs of lost and little-seen art. That Ms. Farahani found Mr. Mohassess and persuaded him to share his story is a terrific coup, even if a great deal of his lifeâ€™s work remains elusive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As important, the factory also functions as a metaphor for the regionâ€™s history of economic catastrophe, and its mob and political corruption. There, amid the ruins, Rita and Salvo begin to break free of that legacy with a bond that brings to mind other tales of blind women and sighted men, including â€œCity Lightsâ€ù and â€œMagnificent Obsession.â€ù Although the romance in â€œSalvoâ€ù remains tentative, in keeping with the movieâ€™s art film ambiguity, the filmmakersâ€™ embrace of the improbable evokes a movie time when crazy plot turns happened as a matter of melodramatic course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Itâ€™s here that we get our first good look at Salvo with a close-up of his eyes, an image that evokes a Sergio Leone signature shot and, like the lack of dialogue and ensuing action, suggests the movieâ€™s affiliation with the spaghetti western. Somewhat to that end, thereâ€™s an uneasy, claustrophobic quality to this section, partly because weâ€™re crowded into the car, too, but also because everything about the scene â€” the depopulated streets, the crumbling buildings, a train rocketing through the tense quiet â€” feels like a trap.

Salvoâ€™s kindness toward the coupleâ€™s neglected dog deepens the idea that his relationship with Rita has led to a moral awakening. But while this humanization of the hit man has obvious religious overtones, Mr. Grassadonia and Mr. Piazza donâ€™t take this salvation theme all that far.

A go-between reaches out first to 15-year-old Beverly Aadland (Dakota Fanning), who is invited to a play audition in a country house borrowed for the purpose, which is not to audition.

Scudder, his hair darkened and wearing a messy goatee, shoots two robbers and chases a third, all but dancing down some stairs before shooting the runner dead.

Women die, but without becoming cinematic spectacles, a relief given how often their dead bodies are used as ornaments elsewhere.

Unsurprisingly for a screenwriter, Mr. Frank gives the characters lots to talk about, both on and studiously off point. He also streamlines the bookâ€™s story and jettisons some characters, including Scudderâ€™s prostitute girlfriend, whom he blithely refers to as a whore.

He also comes off as too cute for the pervading bleakness, and his genre-conscious name-dropping of Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade registers as a self-amused authorial flourish. Narratively, though, TJ is redeemed by becoming the receiver of terrible knowledge passed to him by Scudder. An amateur comic-book artist, TJ has a default mode that is jocular and deflecting. Heâ€™s street tough, if only on the surface, and Scudderâ€™s world is an excuse for him to play good guys and bad. (After TJ steals a gun, Scudder tells him to shoot himself.)

But Ms. Myers too often tells rather than shows, and she doesnâ€™t have the cinematic skill set to transform her idea into a fully satisfying movie, especially at this low-budget level.

In the old Hollywood, she would have stayed busy playing fatal beauties, seductive debutantes, hungry heiresses; Preston Sturges would have known what to do with her.

This is a matter of timing, structure and psychological insight, all of which seem to have vanished on the way to the screen. One of the themes of â€œThis Is Where I Leave Youâ€ù (both book and film) is that the older generation â€” the late Mr. Altman and his wife â€” had life figured out in a way that their children, flailing around in unhappy approximations of adulthood, can never quite match.

Dating is no more a part of Saraâ€™s life than commercial popular culture, and Colby is both too respectful and too easily distracted to pursue her with much zeal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then again, the movie is on Nickâ€™s side from the start, making the case for him, from the way he services Amy sexually to the gentle way he treats their cat. He sometimes explodes, as when he throws a glass to the floor while talking to two cops, Boney (an excellent Kim Dickens) and Gilpin (a dryly funny Patrick Fugit).

In the book, the narrative duties are fairly evenly distributed between Nick and Amy, who recount alternating versions of their happy times and unhappily ever after, with him taking you through events as they happen in the first person, while her point of view comes into focus partly through her detailed diary entries.

As Nick becomes mired in the search for Amy, she confides how romance gave way to marital dreariness, accusations, his mounting loathing, her growing fear.

Julien, you soon discover, has been arrested and is being interrogated about a death. The initial glimpses of him and Esther making love in the blue room turn out to be flashbacks, much like illustrated memories, that he has summoned up during his different statements at different times and in different spaces to the police, a shrink (Blutch) and a judge (Laurent Poitrenaux).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. Amalricâ€™s direction remains graceful through the storyâ€™s violent turns, its mood changes and tone shifts.

Julien lives with his wife, Delphine (LÃ©a Drucker), and their daughter, Suzanne (Mona Jaffart), in one of those cold modernist houses that look like prisons.

Itâ€™s the kind of big movie kiss that sends noir heroes to their knees and maybe their graves and that accompanied by crashing ocean waves and intensifying music, elevates Scottieâ€™s passion for Madeleine in Hitchcockâ€™s â€œVertigo,â€ù one of Mr. Amalricâ€™s touchstones.

The most obvious divide is between Mr. Keaton, who, starting in 1989, played Batman in two movies directed by Tim Burton, and Riggan, who made a killing playing Birdman, a feathered franchise jackpot.

As Philip seems headed to embrace Zimmermanâ€™s self-immolating example, the film moves in another direction. Nothing speaks better to this than the astonishing coda to a late, bitter fight in which Mr. Perry and Ms. Moss together create â€” with a lingering close-up and eddies of triumph, despair, elation and regret â€” a masterwork about what it is to live for love and not just the self.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
