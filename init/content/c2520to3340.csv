A penniless Mr. Haney and a friend jump a fence and make it backstage before being ejected. But Mr. Haney gets great shots. Undaunted, he scores a ticket to Bonnaroo, then crashes the Ultra Festival in Miami. A homemade Bonnaroo DVD wins him a spot documenting a Mumford & Sons tour, and Rolling Stone runs one of his photos. An HBO assignment lets him take a side trip to the Glastonbury festival. Ultimately, his path takes him to Austin City Limits and the Grammys."

Mr. Araki’s style blends detachment and sensationalism. He shoots in the bright, lurid colors of melodrama but surveys the agony in front of him with cool serenity. In his films of the ’90s — nihilistic spectacles like “The Living End,” “Doom Generation” and “Nowhere” — this attitude was exciting, even shocking. In “Mysterious Skin,” still his masterpiece, he turned an almost unbearably horrific story of sexual abuse into something haunting and humane. A similar impulse animates “White Bird in a Blizzard,” but its elements don’t really cohere."

A local hot shot named Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) stole Tobey’s girlfriend, Anita (Dakota Johnson), and then did some even worse stuff, stuff that wrecked Tobey’s business, landed him in jail and cost the life of one of his friends. Tobey glowers and sighs and speaks in a low, sorrowful rasp."

Ms. Godard, known for her collaboration with the filmmaker Claire Denis, suggests an entire movie with Claudia’s first visit to the household: a five-minute running take that segues from one character to the next with roving shots that are like internal monologues. And the way she shoots and lights the face of Wendy (Wendy Guillén), Martha’s heavyset teenage daughter, hiding under a mop of hair, says just as much as an unexpected scene about her cutting her arms and making drug cocktails."

This is Salvo — the word means safe in Italian — an enforcer and sometimes chauffeur for a criminal enterprise. Sprawled on a small bed in an equally undersized room, Salvo is pointedly waiting in the dark, a state that’s at once physical and metaphysical. It’s dawn in Palermo, the gritty Sicilian capital that the directors — Fabio Grassadonia and Antonio Piazza, making a very fine feature debut — turn into a stage for a story that, at times, could be titled “Once Upon a Time in Sicily.”"

For the most part Mr. Ridley avoids big scenes and long speeches, although he does give Jimi some nice cosmic aperçus and trippy philosophical thoughts. And rather than hewing to a strict narrative line, Mr. Ridley takes a generally more fragmented and associative approach to the material. He retells famous stories, like the time that Clapton ceded the stage to Hendrix, but avoids most of the old behind-the-music clichés. Working with his own fine backup, Mr. Ridley narrows in on gestures, catches looks, throws in family photographs, folds in found footage and occasionally freezes the frame. Rockers bow and birds flutter as Jimi watches from the quiet of his own unfathomable depths only to ignite onstage."

The more plausible explanation is that the writer and director, James DeMonaco, like a lot of Americans, read Shirley Jackson’s influential 1948 short story “The Lottery” at an impressionable age. Ritual sacrifice, either of the self or others, may be almost as old as humanity itself, but it’s also enjoying a pop cultural moment, from the purifying spectacle of “The Hunger Games” series to gladiatorial shows like “Dancing With the Stars” and that blood-slicked altar of worship known as “Game of Thrones.”"

He portrays himself both as selflessly loyal and as ferociously independent, and when asked whether he sees himself as the master or the pawn of events answers both and neither. When Mr. Morris wonders if it might have been better to stay out of Iraq — a view now widely held among Americans of both political parties — Mr. Rumsfeld takes refuge in the unknowable. “Time will tell,” he says."

The father (James Le Gros) and son have never processed their grief or discussed the imminent marriage, which David is too shy to say he deeply resents, even though he agreed to be the best man."

He is an imp who is venerated as a deity, a Rorschach test, a lightning rod, a fighting word. His name seems to divide the world into skeptics and worshipers, with not much middle ground. Analogous figures can be found in other zones of 20th-century art: Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan, Ezra Pound. They have their singularity in common. They also tend to confound easy distinctions between genius and trickery, and to marshal armies of exegetes in what may be the futile enterprise of figuring out what they mean."

For the rest of us, talent matters, as demonstrated by the chasm separating the “Dark Knight” films and failed adaptations like “Green Lantern.” Kirsten Dunst’s wistful turn as Mary Jane in Mr. Raimi’s trilogy did much to humanize the series, and helped put a personal touch on an industrial product. As Gwen, Peter’s other historically romantic foil, Ms. Stone performs much the same duty in Mr. Webb’s movies, as she effortlessly charms Peter (and you) and brings him to tears. In the comic book, both women have played a part in Peter’s life, but apparently that’s more than the franchise’s male screenwriters and directors could handle. So, with Mary Jane nowhere in sight, it’s just Gwen and Peter, dewy lovers discovering each other between spasms of mostly bloodless violence. Mr. Webb has some fun with the image of Spider-Man swinging through the urban canyons, and there are moments — as when the image freezes on the tucked, airborne Spider-Man, ready to spring into action like an Olympian — in which the movie taps into the giddy freedom and near-unboundedness that the character’s physical transformation has brought him.

The most ceremonial of the bosses, Fuse (Shigeru Koyama), can be the most dastardly, and even Kimura (Hideo Nakano), a yakuza who left the game, dives back in with finger-severing gusto."

He specializes in intimate portraits of people whose sense of reality is coming undone, and Noah, played with rabid gloominess by Russell Crowe, is no exception. The difference between him and Mr. Aronofsky’s earlier protagonists is that Noah’s mental equilibrium is bound up with the fate of humanity, and that his actions may have a lesson to teach us."

Its lessons about human nature are thought-provoking, but perhaps not as memorable as its motley, eccentric display of humanity in extremis. And though the movie is playfully postmodern in its pastiche of styles and its mingling of sincerity and self-consciousness, there is also something solidly old-fashioned about the way it tells its story. Long, crowded and ambitious almost to the point of hubris, it reminded me a little of “The Poseidon Adventure” and other 1970s-vintage action allegories full of great actors struggling to survive. That’s a compliment, by the way. Disaster has become a matter of routine at the movies (in more ways than one). Planetary destruction and human extinction happen a half-dozen times every summer.

At its most persuasive, these period imitations feel of a piece with the fetishization of ’70s cinema that has informed Quentin Tarantino’s work, most explicitly in “Grindhouse,” his and Robert Rodriguez’s double-feature pastiche of old exploitation cinema. The French critic Emmanuel Burdeau wrote that the car race at the center of Mr. Tarantino’s contribution is metaphorically “that of film stock”: it’s film that makes the movie.

In a dark corner of the whimsically named city of San Fransokyo (it is a small world), a rowdy crowd has gathered for illegal fights in which remote-controlled robot combatants square off. Here, amid cheers, swooping visuals and the score’s pounding beats, the 14-year-old prodigy Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) makes like a seasoned hustler with a shark smile and a robot annihilator, a triumph that leads to a getaway, a failed race to the rescue and a stint in jail."

In the opening scene at the airport, Marie calls out to Ahmad, who can’t hear her because they’re separated by glass. It’s a funny bit because it plays like a nod to Ms. Bejo’s star turn in the silent film “The Artist,” but it also represents the couple’s essential divide."

There is a dying woman serenaded by a dozen or so volunteers with the hymn “How Great Thou Art”; an inmate who finds new purpose in life as a hospice volunteer; a man who lost two limbs, cherishing his nurse’s visits because “Brian is an Army guy,” too.

Having decided to take up Zimmerman’s offer to write in the country, Philip has left her alone in Brooklyn for the summer, a reckless decision with catastrophic consequences. This narrative split is a bold formal move and a relief because it gives you a break from all that male ego. It’s also pleasurable because Ms. Moss is rapidly emerging as one of the most exciting actresses in American movies, and there’s great joy in just watching this intensely expressive, empathetic performer. There’s mischief in her eyes and smile, but she has a silent screen actress’s wistfulness and a gift for conveying an inner stillness that can suggest depths of melancholy."

The clever historical revisionism of “X-Men: First Class” (a high point in the series, along with “X2: X-Men United”) has given way to a more slapdash mix of period detail and clumsy anachronism."

Somewhat surprisingly, there’s also next to no information about it in “Manakamana,” which consists of 11 uncut shots — each 10 to 11 minutes long, or a 400-foot roll of 16-millimeter film — most taken in a closed cable car. The movie is being released digitally but its luxurious visual quality, with its near-tactile sense of texture and depth, owes much to it being shot on film."

Of course, the house has other residents — Tony, Wyatt’s unseen ghostly playmate (à la “Paranormal Activity 3”), and Abigail, a sinister-looking doll (à la Annabelle in “The Conjuring”) — and countless surveillance cameras. Eventually, Malcolm enlists his neighbor (the stand-up comic Gabriel Iglesias); married, bickering exorcists (Missi Pyle and Hayes MacArthur); and his friend Father Williams (Cedric the Entertainer, back from the last installment) to help curtail the annoying visitations."

There is plenty of evidence — both in the movie and beyond it — to support Koba’s view, but the film comes down squarely, and maybe a little too squishily, on the side of tolerance and cooperation. The ape and human societies are parallel primitive patriarchies (women nurture and worry, while men lead and fight, a disappointing but hardly surprising failure of imagination on the filmmakers’ part), and they are threatened by symmetrical schisms. As Koba opposes Caesar, so does Malcolm (Mr. Clarke’s character) find himself increasingly at odds with Dreyfus (Mr. Oldman), who sees the apes as a mortal threat to be confronted with maximum brutality."

Maybe so, but the dominant flavor of “The Hundred-Foot Journey” is pure banality."

Even before the earthquake, Haiti had earned the dubious reputation as a  Republic of NGO’s (for nongovernmental organizations) because of the sheer number of such groups — estimates range as high as 10,000 — working there. The need for aid after the quake seemed obvious given the devastation, yet as Mr. Peck starkly illustrates, the gulf between what was needed and what was initially provided was at times vast. That was the case with debris disposal: The capital of Port-au-Prince, he shows, had about 25 times the amount of debris that was at the World Trade Center after 9/11."

By contrast, American movies today often roil with orgiastic violence that’s a conspicuous substitute for sexual desire.

The always amusing Jay Baruchel is the sidekick Crunch brings in on the job. And, for those who like this kind of thing, a sculpture of a giant vagina plays a pivotal role."

A beat cop emerges from the shadows with a smile and asks Frankie why he’s out. Frankie says he’s wooing a girl and starts singing as if to prove it."

It isn’t necessarily Mr. Webb’s fault, but the scene serves as a brief, irksome reminder that most women in the big comic-book movies continue to be consigned to supporting roles, and especially antediluvian ones, good for ogling and saving and not much more. Gwen is actually more interesting. That’s because, unlike some other superhero stories in which godlike heroes live and love among ordinary folk, Peter remains a strongly human presence. As a superhero, he carries impossible weight on his slim shoulders, but it’s life itself that presses down on him with its burdening guilt, regret and sorrow."

He does not so much transcend genre conventions as fulfill them with the zeal of a true believer. It may be enough to say that “Interstellar” is a terrifically entertaining science-fiction movie, giving fresh life to scenes and situations we’ve seen a hundred times before, and occasionally stumbling over pompous dialogue or overly portentous music. (In general, the score, by Hans Zimmer, is exactly as portentous as it needs to be.)"

They’re also a little too dumb for the adolescent or adult genre geeks. The mythology seems to have been cobbled together at corporate strategy sessions out of notions ripped off from elsewhere. The battle between the human-allied Autobots and the treacherous Decepticons recalls the intramutant struggles of the X-Men universe. The sentient robots from a distant time who speak in catchphrases and smash buildings have some kinship with the Terminator. The elaborate, thematically overloaded martial back story carries echoes of Tolkien and “Star Wars.” Lasting 166 minutes — though it feels much longer — “Age of Extinction” makes clear what has always been true of the Transformers movies: Although they may look like soulless corporate studio product, they are really examples of personal cinema, expressions of the will and imagination of their director, Michael Bay. The narrative incoherence is a feature, not a bug. (The screenplay is by Ehren Kruger.) Mr. Bay’s strongest films (with the partial exception of “Pain and Gain”) are those in which the battle between sense and sensation ends in a rout.

Then we meet Heli (Armando Espitia) as he answers a knock on the door and chats with a friendly census worker in a bright yellow polo shirt. Her questions sound reasonable enough at first: How many people in the household? What is your profession? Later they will seem grotesquely irrelevant to the facts of Heli’s life."

The men, women and children in the cars wear some traditional garments, although three longhaired male beauties pop up in T-shirts, the universal uniform of youth. Some passengers chat, others laugh, while still others sit in silence framed by the large window that turns the brilliant emerald landscape — dotted by passers-by and grazing cows — into a film within a film.

Mr. Steadman wrote “Vermeer’s Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces,” in which he argues, as others have before him, that Vermeer used a camera obscura to create his paintings. A camera obscura — a precursor to the photographic camera — is an optical device used to project images. As Mr. Steadman has asserted elsewhere, Vermeer used “the camera to study optical images and effects; as an instrument with which to set up and adjust his compositional arrangements of sitters and furniture; and as a means to obtain traced outlines for complete pictures, at their final sizes.”"

Kirstein brought George Balanchine to America (together they founded City Ballet and the School of American Ballet); was friends with the architect Philip Johnson; and was involved in the planning of Lincoln Center.

With Mr. Maloof playing M.C. and sleuth, he and Mr. Siskel follow much the same arc that runs through the better news accounts about Maier.

It was not only that Theresienstadt, 37 miles from Prague, was a transit point for Jews who would be deported to the death camps in the East, but also that its facade of normalcy was maintained through terror and manipulation.

It took Mr. Okiura seven years to realize his story, but it doesn’t take Momo nearly that long to comprehend that sometimes only by reconciling with the dead can we be guided back to life."

Because Joe’s story has been divided, this isn’t a review of the second part (we’ll take it on when it opens), but I will say that the separation feels like a mistake.

The real scandal dates back to 1978 and an F.B.I. investigation into political corruption that found agents posing as wealthy sheikhs anxious to buy off public officials. (Abscam was short for Arab scam, or the nominally less derogatory Abdul scam.) The swindle netted a trove of greasy-palmed politicians, but also charges of entrapment."

Though he insists that he and his government are unwaveringly neutral, he is clearly in communication with the Resistance and has been spying on his interlocutor. He disarms the general with tales of bygone Parisian intrigue — they are in the very room where Napoleon III kept one of his mistresses — and appeals, in turn, to his conscience, his vanity and his self-protective instincts."

Mr. Krauss largely advances this argument through talking head interviews, and videos and atrocity photographs shot by the soldiers.

The reluctant leader of the rebels, a back-of-the-train troublemaker named Curtis, is played by Chris Evans, his clean-cut Captain America charisma obscured by scruffy facial hair and a black wool watch cap. He is a stoical, heroic presence amid the chaos, which means he has less room to be interesting than the other actors, who provide some of that chaos. They include Octavia Spencer, John Hurt and Jamie Bell as some of Curtis’s fellow insurgents, whose careful planning and simmering resentments blossom into revolt after an especially cruel provocation by the authorities. There are soldiers in riot gear, armed with clubs and guns, but for Mr. Bong evil is never anonymous. He gives it a grotesque, human face — or rather a series of faces, most memorably Tilda Swinton’s, almost unrecognizable in prosthetic teeth and oversize glasses. She serves as a kind of spokeswoman for Mr. Wilford (Ed Harris), the enigmatic engineer who is both dictator and deity in this postapocalyptic world. As the train moves in its long, winding route around the globe, teetering on the edge of both sustainability and plausibility, Curtis and his comrades undertake a long march toward the engine. They are joined by Minsu (the great shape-shifting South Korean actor Song Kang-ho), a security specialist, and his daughter, Yona (Ko Ah-sung), both addicted to an inhalant called Kronole."

In his afterword to “All You Need Is Kill,” Mr. Sakurazaka explains that he was thinking about video games while writing the novel. “I reset the game hundreds of times,” he writes, “until my special attack finally went off perfectly.” In other words, video games are a type of time machine that allows players, if they put in the hours, to achieve victory. Hence the movie’s clever tagline, “Live, Die, Repeat,” which, of course, echoes the faith that every film genre fan embraces: live, watch, repeat."

It has been a while since Mr. Scorsese has thrown himself into filmmaking with this kind of exuberance. “Goodfellas,” a sprawling inquiry into how some men do business, is an obvious precedent, and so is “Mean Streets,” an intensive study of how some men get into trouble. Even the occasional lapses of filmmaking technique (scenes that drag on too long, shots that don’t match, noticeable continuity glitches) feel like signs of life. This movie may tire you out with its hammering, swaggering excess, but it is never less than wide-awake."

In the real 1930s, places like Zubrowka were on the brink of inconceivable barbarism and unprecedented slaughter. A beautiful, fragile Central European civilization was all but demolished, surviving mainly as the ghostly object of nostalgic longing. Mr. Anderson embraces this nostalgia — for a bygone modernity of railway compartments, telegrams and handmade luggage; of louche aristocrats, discreet bellhops and ruddy-faced workingmen; of painting and poetry and psychoanalysis — but he also tries to work through it, to capture some of the vitality and peculiarity of a vanished world."

They just don’t feel very fresh or fully integrated into a coherent speculative world."

He is a fervently intense young man who, like Mr. ben Yitzhak, speaks perfect English. His reminiscences return repeatedly to the concept of shame. His acute sense of it began when he was raped as a young boy, an assault that he says he dared not tell anyone about because of the stigma attached.

Simone becomes an inspiration for Violette, as well as a coolly aloof object of desire, and their relationship fascinates for obvious reasons. More important, it feels true in its complexities and contradictions, in its emotional push and psychological pull. It also serves as a lifeline for Violette, something she clings to during her frantic desperation, stubborn poverty, emotional squalls and messy friendships, including with Jean Genet (Jacques Bonaffé), and a perfumer-patron, Jacques Guérin (Olivier Gourmet). Violette’s hold on life can be terrifying, at times ugly, but what she finally makes of that life is beautiful."

Loosely based on a novel by Hannelore Hippe and directed by Georg Maas, it unwraps the biography of this so-called Katrine, who after supposedly escaping East Germany by boat, was united with her supposed mother, Ase (Liv Ullmann), in Norway. Now Katrine is married to Bjarte (Sven Nordin), a Norwegian submarine captain with whom she is passionately in love; they live with their daughter (Julia Bache-Wiig), her baby and Ase, a dignified, taciturn woman with haunted eyes. We are tipped off that Katrine may be concealing her real identity: in an early scene, she visits East Germany in disguise and calls herself Vera."

It’s a lack of clarity that, as “Fed Up” shows, has played out in competing narratives about obesity. To rectify this, the article suggests that recasting obesity as a literal epidemic meriting the implementation of the “Epidemic Investigation protocol” could have the “potential both to restructure the public health response to obesity and reframe public argument on the issue.” What would happen, say, if obesity were fought like polio?"

That’s because, try as Mr. Benson might, his narrative ambitions are thwarted by narrative conventions that lead him to smooth every jagged edge and dry each teary eye. “Characters must not brood too long,” as Forster also dryly observed, or “waste time running up and down ladders in their own insides.” They have to serve the big finish — or, in this case, three."

It’s here that we get our first good look at Salvo with a close-up of his eyes, an image that evokes a Sergio Leone signature shot and, like the lack of dialogue and ensuing action, suggests the movie’s affiliation with the spaghetti western. Somewhat to that end, there’s an uneasy, claustrophobic quality to this section, partly because we’re crowded into the car, too, but also because everything about the scene — the depopulated streets, the crumbling buildings, a train rocketing through the tense quiet — feels like a trap. The entrance of two gunmen on a motorcycle brutally breaks the silence, as fast-moving bullets and bodies shift the movie into another register."

Sometimes there’s nothing of interest behind the scenes, but Mr. Krauss might have served his material better if he had pulled the curtain back in “The Kill Team,” if only to explain why a movie that initially seems to be about one thing — as its shocker title suggests — is a partisan portrait of Specialist Winfield and his family."

The role was initially voiced by the British actor Samantha Morton, who, after the movie was shot, was replaced by Ms. Johansson and whose casting feels inevitable. Her voice isn’t an especially melodious instrument, but it’s a surprisingly expressive one (as Woody Allen has figured out) that slides from squeaky girlishness to a smoky womanliness suggestive of late nights and whiskeys. It’s crucial that each time you hear Ms. Johansson in “Her,” you can’t help but flash on her lush physicality, too, which helps fill in Samantha and give this ghostlike presence a vibrant, palpable form, something that would have been trickier to pull off with a lesser-known performer."

Gordon Gekko, the lizard of “Wall Street,” proclaimed that greed is good. That sentiment is far too lofty for Jordan. What matters to him is that greed is fun."

In Ryan’s case, those powers are synonymous with those of the United States, for which he serves first with the military and then the C.I.A. for liberty and justice for all or, really, just America. He’s tapped for spook service by an older agent in a naval officer’s uniform, Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner). Harper is one of those avuncular tutor figures played by actors of a certain age and industry stature (Morgan Freeman once had a monopoly on such roles), but here the character does double duty in that it allows Mr. Costner ceremonially to pass the action-hero torch to Mr. Pine."

Rather, after starting her story when she begins to write, he leaps across time, jumping from one defining moment to the next, the meaning of which may be revealed only later. In one scene, after Maurice and Violette have separated, she visits a Parisian apartment to sell some goods, her flashy clothing and bleach job clashing with the flat’s bourgeois restraint. There she meets an acquaintance who tells her that Maurice has been arrested, and that she may be able to help. The point of the scene seems to be Maurice’s fate (and her hardness), although later it becomes clear that it is also about her fate because it’s here that Violette notices a book by someone named Simone de Beauvoir."

Usually, they have adventures, and not just dreams, to go with their wasp waists and froufrou. Sometimes they save the day and their true love, which is better and more fun than waiting to be saved.

Rose is a half-human and half-vampire called a Dhampir, and the guardian in training for Lissa, a Moroi princess. When the movie opens, Rose and Lissa are on the lam, having run away sometime earlier from their school, St. Vladimir’s Academy, because of some kind of complicated threat. They’re soon hauled back to school by some men in black, including a stud with a ponytail, Dimitri (an appealing Danila Kozlovsky), though after fending off a gaggle of bad vampires. These are the resident villains, the Strigoi, immortals whose red eyes suggest cheap special effects and hangovers. The Strigoi are trouble, but less so than some of the other kids."

The desert blooms with melodrama and film noir, and the streets teem with cynicism, conspiracy and corruption.

As such, it encounters an obvious contradiction, one that bothered the 10-year-old Lego maven who accompanied me to the press screening. The overt message is that you should throw out the manuals and follow the lead of your own ingenuity, improvising new combinations for the building blocks in front of you. But the movie itself follows a fairly strict and careful formula, thwarting its inventive potential in favor of the expected and familiar."

There can be tenderness in Mr. Lapid’s gaze, and heat, particularly in the scenes in which Yaron massages Nili with oil, kneading her flesh in a near-pantomime of sex.

It’s perhaps unsurprising that Mr. Jonze’s third feature, “Where the Wild Things Are,” an emotionally delicate live-action adaptation of that Maurice Sendak book, was a visual knockout with a minimalist story and relatively little dialogue."

Yet, as sometimes happens in Mr. Fincher’s work, dread descends like winter shadows, darkening the movie’s tone and visuals until it’s snuffed out all the light, air and nuance. As Nick becomes mired in the search for Amy, she confides how romance gave way to marital dreariness, accusations, his mounting loathing, her growing fear. One minute, he was leaving empty takeout containers strewn about and playing video games; the next, she says, he was raising a hand to her and she was cowering in their bed.

They pale next to Baymax, whose pleasing plumpness and symphony of cartoon sounds — when he walks, his legs produce muffled boing-boing noises — make him the embodiment of kawaii and the Japanese culture of cute. Created by Tadashi, the robot is a palpably tactile and charming screen presence who in time becomes Hiro’s supersize Jiminy Cricket, part folk philosopher, part moral compass. What makes Baymax so memorable and emotionally potent is that he’s also something of a Proustian Marshmallow who triggers an irresistible chain of elemental pleasures: He’s a stuffed animal, a warm blanket, a cozy chair, a warm embrace."

The narrator and protagonist is Mia (Chloë Grace Moretz), who for much of the movie hovers in limbo between life and death, her spiritual self wandering barefoot and invisible through the halls of the hospital where her body lies in a coma. The conceit, put into words by a helpful nurse (Aisha Hinds) and implicit in the film’s title, is that it is up to Mia to decide whether to let herself die or keep on living. The long flashbacks that alternate with her bedside vigil can be seen as attempts to balance the ledger of her short time on earth. Has it been enough? What and whom would she leave behind?

As Philip seems headed to embrace Zimmerman’s self-immolating example, the film moves in another direction. Nothing speaks better to this than the astonishing coda to a late, bitter fight in which Mr. Perry and Ms. Moss together create — with a lingering close-up and eddies of triumph, despair, elation and regret — a masterwork about what it is to live for love and not just the self."

He moves the camera meaningfully, using camera movement to reveal things — as with an outdoor traveling shot across some woods that ends on some people — rather than to just mindlessly chase after his characters.

The loneliness and romance of the traveling life are echoed in the ballads, sea chanteys and blues reveries that Llewyn and his fellow chirpers like to sing. The lyrics palpitate with the pain of loss and leave-taking: “I’m 500 miles from my home”; “I’ve been all around this world”; “Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.” Llewyn, still grieving over the death of his musical partner (heard singing in the voice of Marcus Mumford), is a bit more prosaically adrift, stumbling from one friend’s couch to another, wearing out his welcome faster than his shoes."

The screenplay tracing the characters’ struggles has a tidy, workshopped feel, and the dialogue and acting can be gratingly flat. But what gives the film a certain confidence is its cultural specificity and the fresh clashes and contrasts it presents. The rapport and understanding between Felixia and her serene grandfather, a medicine man (Richard Ray Whitman) is one example of a reprieve from the ham-handedness of the plot devices and some of the performances."

It’s a model of cinematic realism, and its pleasures are obvious yet mysterious. Even after seeing the film three times, I haven’t fully figured out why it has maintained such a hold on me, and why I’m eager to see it again. There are many reasons to love movies, from the stories they tell, to the beautiful characters who live and die for us. And yet the story in “Boyhood” is blissfully simple: A child grows up. This, along with the modesty of its physical production — its humble rooms, quiet moments, ordinary lives — can obscure Mr. Linklater’s ambitions and the greatness of his achievement."

Mr. Jackson is a predictably crude, amusing instrument, even if his character’s ultra-conservative shtick is so familiar — Stephen Colbert mines much the same territory almost nightly — that the satire has no sting."

One guide, for instance, goes into gruesome detail describing how the British painter George Stubbs, in order to understand horse anatomy, used a pulley system to hang their skinned carcasses so that he could draw them. Sometime later, there’s a short, lovely sequence in which a man and a woman perform a pas de deux before some Titian paintings, a sequence that draws a line from Stubbs’s skinned horses to several life drawing classes in the documentary to the figures in the Titian canvases and, finally, to the straining muscles of the dancers."

Repeatedly knocked down throughout this knockabout comedy, Tammy takes a licking and keeps on sticking her foot right back in it. She’s a total loser, except in the comedy of misfortune."

Ms. Wilde and Mr. Pettyfer are very pretty (both have worked as models), and they’re certainly pleasant to look at, even if they’re also, often distractingly, too old for their roles. Jade is supposed to be 17 and sheltered, having spent most of her high school years giving comfort to her parents, Hugh and Anne (Bruce Greenwood and Joely Richardson), after the death of a son. Unlike Ms. Shields, whose status as a preternaturally sexualized child star imbued her with an otherworldly, almost celestial air (the celebrity who fell to Earth), the coltish Ms. Wilde mostly just suggests the supermodel next door. Ms. Feste responds accordingly and shoots Jade twirling and running as if she were in a commercial for an exciting new product. It isn’t that people in love don’t sometimes run ecstatically into the wind, but that the image, like so many shots and so many of the emotional moments, is so canned. When Jade and David do make love, it’s on the floor in front of a fireplace; they also hold hands when they jump off a pier into some water. About the only original touch is how the script, by Ms. Feste and Joshua Safran, shifts the story’s weight to Hugh, whose love for his daughter smolders with all the weird, lunatic intensity that’s otherwise missing."

But Mr. Gomes remains laudably faithful to his character, and Ms. Guedes’s bodily sense of languor gets across more than any crystal-clear dramatic statement would."

From its use of images of anonymous obese bodies — a familiar, dehumanizing TV news strategy in which people are shown only from the neck down — it’s clear that even the well-intentioned can struggle with this subject.

There’s a rough, grab-and-go immediacy to the black-and-white images, which seem at once random and carefully chosen: A few men sweep the streets, another opens a storefront gate and yet another expels an impressively long, rubbery stream of spittle, an act that feels decidedly editorial and almost like punctuation. Shortly after, the black and white switches to color, inaugurating the fictional part of the film. From that moment, everything is in color, yet the strong sense of life — and the sense that you’re watching real people in real situations — remains."

In “Rashomon,” four characters recount a traumatic episode in a forest — a woman is raped and her husband murdered — in separate, contradictory flashbacks.

Will and Marcus find Nate digging graves for the Union and persuade him to return south to visit his brother, whom they say is dying.

Movie studios do a pretty good job of making pleasing, sometimes transporting family entertainment out of original ideas or ancient folklore. Why do they keep messing up the kiddie lit? Are they doing it on purpose?"

That Mr. Posin and Mr. McDuffie have stacked the deck against Nikki would be more irritating if Ms. Bening didn’t immediately make this woman come so satisfyingly alive, breathing believable vitality and at times contradictory emotions into what might have otherwise registered as a blur or cliché. She and Mr. Harris easily hold the movie together, but there’s no doubt that Ms. Bening could also prop it up all by herself."

The men are a ridiculous match in an increasingly preposterous movie — a fine Ms. Ryder plays Sheryl, Gator’s partner in meth and corn-pone accents — but Mr. Franco rolls his eyeballs with just enough commitment in his dinner theater version of the charismatic Southern psycho.

Transplanted from Tokyo to her mother’s family home on a remote island, Momo is depressed and lonely, haunted by the angry words she spoke to her father before he left. Unable to appreciate the terraced citrus groves, mossy forests and turquoise seas that encircle her new world, she frets over her most treasured and tormenting possession: a letter her father started but never finished, its blank page a reminder of all that was left unsaid."

Following their father’s instructions, the twins record everything that happens in a notebook, decorating it with line drawings and dead insects.
