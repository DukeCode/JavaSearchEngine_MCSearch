A note at the beginning of each installment explains that these stories are fictionalized versions of events that occurred in Portugal in 2013 and 2014, as the government adopted austerity measures that squeezed an already demoralized population. Some of the anecdotes have the feel of urban legends arising from a climate of malaise and mistrust. Did you hear the one about the lost dog in the housing project? The outlaw who evaded capture in the mountains? At other times, the dislocation of workers and the erosion of middle-class living standards are confronted directly, as we hear men and women who are not professional actors testify to their hardships.

By the time the movie opens, the wife is long dead, having been murdered by white troops, and GlassŠ—Ès son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), has become his close companion. The sonŠ—Ès name evokes James Fenimore CooperŠ—Ès Hawk-eye (Š—“The Last of the MohicansŠ—), and together Glass and Hawk create an intimate, familial bulwark Š—” and a multicultural father-and-son dyad Š—” in a wilderness teeming with assorted savages."

Worse, he makes Glass not just a helpless witness to a murder thatŠ—Ès a stand-in for the genocide of the Indians, but also a proxy victim of that catastrophe. ItŠ—Ès disappointing in a movie that offers much and that actually points to another foundation story that emerges when one of GlassŠ—Ès companions, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), tries and fails to get paid for his labor.

The kind of rhetoric aimed at Rabin, including from the floor of the Israeli Parliament and from members of the opposition party, will hardly sound unfamiliar to American ears.

The setting is familiar in other ways, too. As a line of Confederate troops marches across a field into Union rifle and artillery fire, a haze of myth starts to gather over the action, a mist of sentiment about the tragedy of the Civil War and the symmetrical valor of the soldiers on both sides of it. But this is a sly piece of misdirection: The rest of the movie will be devoted to blowing that fog away, using the tools of Hollywood spectacle to restore a measure of clarity to our understanding of the war and its aftermath."

Was he a compassionate godsend to those whose agony had been played down or discounted by previous physicians? Or was he a gullible, perhaps criminal accomplice to patients who were conning him to feed an addiction or resell their prescriptions?"

Presenting evidence for both, Ms. Marson includes law enforcement officials who investigated Dr. Hurwitz as part of a long-term effort to control a rising painkiller epidemic. As a result, blame ricochets from patient to doctor to Big Pharma (whose representatives declined to appear in the film) without sticking to anyone."

It opens as if it were a kidŠ—Ès film, then applies a light slapstick touch to a Š—“letŠ—Ès take out the railroad bridgeŠ— scenario that gets harder to maintain as the casualties mount. The movieŠ—Ès contempt for its Japanese characters reaches a peculiar culmination in a scene in which ritual suicide is played for laughs. ItŠ—Ès heartening to see Mr. Chan, who plays the avuncular leader of the guerrillas, demonstrating that heŠ—Ès still game, but you wish his energy were being expended in more consistently enjoyable pictures."

Scenes in which the main figures Š—” a ragtag, argumentative but largely cheerful batch of Chinese guerrillas intent on sabotaging the Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War Š—” strategize over meals or regroup in a cave after an attack are pleasantly reminiscent of this genreŠ—Ès offerings from Asia in the 1970s and early Š—È80s, period pieces or not. And, of course, thereŠ—Ès Jackie Chan, the performer whoŠ—Ès the sound eraŠ—Ès heir to Buster Keaton."

He nevertheless remains an impressive physical performer. Clever and resourceful, heŠ—Ès found a new way into the action: Instead of driving it, he now dazzles us by sidestepping it. In a fight scene atop a moving train, Mr. Chan lets younger stuntmen jump and fly and punch while the star himself finds elegant methods of getting out of their way."
